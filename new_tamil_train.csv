"Kalidasa (Devanagari: कालिदास) was an Indian poet and dramatist who excelled in Sanskrit literature. A complete historiography of Kalidasa is not known.[1] However, his works such as Sagunthalam, Meghadutam, Iraguvamsam, Kumarasambavam, Malavikakinimitra, Vikramorvasiyam, Rudu Samharam occupy an important place in Indian language literature. He is believed to belong to the fifth century during the Gupta period.[2][3] His epics depict the beauty of nature and reflect the culture of the people who lived at that time. Period Kalidasa; Many ancient and medieval texts consider him to have been the poet of Vikramaditya, the king of Ujjain, the legendary Indian state. The famous king named Vikramaditya, He is said to have ruled the ancient city of Ujjain in the Malwa region of central India in the 1st century BC. A section knows that the famous Vikramaditya is not a historical name. It is notable that Ujjain was ruled by Vikramaditya, Chandragupta II (380 – 415 BC) and Yasodharman (6th century BC).[4] During any period of the Gupta Empire (a) the three royal dynasties Chandra Gupta II [Vikramaditya] (375-413 AD), Kumara Gupta [Mahendraditya] (413-455 AD), Skanda Gupta [Vikramaditya] (455-467 AD) believed to have lived.[5] Early life Scholars speculate that Kalidasa lived in various regions near the Himalayas in the Indian subcontinent, in the ancient city of Ujjain in the Malwa region of central India, and in Kalinga Nadu in the modern-day states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.[6] The above information is based on Kalidasa's extensive description of the Himalayan ranges in the dramatic poem Kumarasambavam, an epic poem composed in Sanskrit. Also, the scenes of his deep love for Ujjain are richly illustrated in his epics Meghadhootam and Iraguvamsam.[7] Kasumire Pandit and Sanskrit scholar ""Lakshmi Dar Kalla"" (1891 - 1953) wrote a book titled Birth of Kalidasa in 1926, which based Kalidasa's birth on his writings. It is also said that Kalidasa was born in Kasumi, but moved south to seek the support of local rulers.[8][9][10] Description of flora and fauna found in Kashmir other than in Ujjain and Kalinga: saffron plants, deodar trees, kathuri deer etc. Description of common geographical features in Kashmir: small lakes on hill, deserts etc. According to Kalla, we can mention some important sites that can be identified in Kashmir locations. Such sites are not very popular outside Kashmir and therefore, one who is not closely associated with Kashmir may not be familiar with it. Some of the Puranic references to the Kasumiri dynasty include Nagumba (mentioned in the Kasumir text Nilamada Purana); A legend (in Shakuntala) mentions the creation of Kasumi from a lake. This mythological story, mentioned in the Niladha Purana, is believed to be about a tribal leader named Ananta who drained a lake to kill a demon. It is noteworthy that the erstwhile lake (now land) Ananta was named ""Kashmir"", after his father Kashiyappa. According to Kalla, Shakuntala is an allegorical drama of the Pratyapsina philosophy (a branch of Kasumira Saivism). Galla further argues that the branch was not known outside Kashmir during that period.[11] According to folklore, Kalidasa is originally depicted as a scholar and married to a princess of Mahishapuri.[12] Due to his wife's challenge, he is believed to have become a great poet and another legend has it that he became Kumaradasa in Ceylon, known as Ceylon, where Kalidasa was murdered due to some treachery.[13] creations Abhiknana Sakundalam  Sagunthalam is the fully historical romantic epic of Sakunthalai, a fragment of the Mahabharata. The daughter Sakundala was born to the celestial angel Menaka and Vishwamitra. Knowing that Menakai was assigned to break Vishwamitra's penance, Vishwamitra leaves his wife (Menakai), Sey (Sakunthal). Menakai leaves Shakuntala in the forest as she is forced to go to the upper world after completing her mission. Sage Kanva finds and nurtures Sakunthalai, surrounded by birds and protected. The Magadha king Dushyantha, who came to hunt in the Kanaka oasis, falls in love with Sakundala. And he married Sakunthalai and lived for some time, leaving Kanakam due to a riot in the capital and going to the country. Earlier, he gives her his ring as a token and promises to return soon. After a long time, Shakuntala, who always lives in the memory of Dushyantha, fails to welcome Sage Durvasa who visits her ashram one day. Enraged by this, Durvasar curses Sakundala to forget her, the person who lives in her memory. In such an environment, Dushyantha completely forgets Shakuntala. Sakundala, who goes to his country in search of him, also loses the ring she had given him in his memory. A son named Bharata is born to them. The final scene is his union with Dushyantan after various tribulations. Aphiknana Sakunthalam derives its title from the union with Dushyantana's ring (apiknyanam) and the love of Sakundala protected by birds. This poem highlights Kalidasa's great personality in describing the beauty of nature. Iraguvamsam  Raghuvamsam, an epic summarizing the biographies of Ramapiran's ancestor Dilipan, Raghu, Ayan, Dasaratha, Rama, Lavan-Kusan, was recited by Kalidasa as Raghuvamsam.[14] Meghadutham  Meghadutham is a messenger sent by a cloud to Kubera's courtier to rush off to see his queen after completing some official duties. It is similar to the messenger genre found in other Tamil literature. Kalidasa describes the journeys of the cloud over all natural resources such as forests, mountains, rivers, lakes, flowers, etc. as streams.[15] Kumarasambavam  Kumarasambavam depicts the burning of Cupid for breaking Lord Shiva's penance, Goddess Parvati's penance reaching Lord Shiva, birth of Lord Muruga, etc. Vikramovarsiyam   Vikramovarsiyam is a love epic between Pururavan and Suvarka Nathanamanga. Pururavan rescues Urvasi from the demon Kasi and hands her over to Devendran. Devendran also gives Urvasi to Pururavan himself. They lived together for some time and separated. Pururavan finally recovers from the mental anguish caused by this separation. Malavikakinimitra  Malavikakinimitra is an epic about the Sungka emperor Akinimitra, whose capital was Vidisha in the state of Madhya Pradesh, who falls in love with and later marries his queen's servant Malavika. Other works Rudu Samharam - Irudu Sankara Kavyam in Tamil. Translated by Satasiva Iyer.[16] Kalidasa has beautifully sung the seasons of nature in this epic.

"Sir Alexander Fleming (August 6, 1881 – March 11, 1955) was the discoverer of the bactericidal lytic enzyme. He also isolated penicillin from the fungus Penicillium notatum. Discovery of Penicillin The discovery of penicillin is unique among the medical advances the world has known. Before the era of penicillin, women dying in childbirth and babies dying after birth were commonplace. Even minor bruises and scratches led to death. It was only after the discovery of antibiotics like penicillin, which could kill one microorganism and kill another, that humans were saved from many diseases. Alec Sander Fbauming is the scientist credited with discovering penicillin and ushering in the era of modern antibiotics. Penicillin has saved an estimated 20 million lives worldwide. birth Fleming was born on 6 August 1881 in Scotland[1]. His early education was located in a hilly area surrounded by nature. It was there that he was trained to admire nature and observe things closely. It was this training that later helped him discover the wonder drug penicillin. He joined a shipping company as an officer at the age of 16 after graduating from a technical college. Clerical work did not satisfy him. A fortune from a distant relative enabled him to enter medical school at a very late age in his 20s. The fight against pathogens After graduation, Fleming became an assistant to Almnath Wright, who was engaged in research against pathogens. Paul Enrique, a German scientist, discovered the drug Salwarson for the deadly sexually transmitted disease Syphilis. Fleming introduced an improved method of testing blood to diagnose the disease more easily. If Wright's vaccine had not been used during the first four years of World War I, thousands would have died of typhoid fever. At that time, they used anti-toxic drugs like carbolic acid, boric acid and hydrogen peroxide to treat wounded soldiers. Fleming demonstrated that these drugs did not help the treatment and destroyed the white blood cells, leading to more deaths. He turned his attention to finding the perfect antidote. He began to study the dynamics of different types of microbes by growing them in plates. When he took a couple of drops of his own nasal discharge and cultured it on a plate containing bacteria, he saw that only the bacteria around the mucous membrane were destroyed. Similarly, he took many fluids secreted in the body like tears, saliva and pus and subjected them to research. He found that all of these fluids had the ability to inhibit the growth of pathogens. He named this naturally occurring anti-toxin as 'Lysozyme'. Penicillin from fungus  In 1928, while tending to a plate of cultured microorganisms, he accidentally discovered that lysozyme did something the mushroom had never done before. The mushroom killed staphylococci that cause infections in blisters, warts, nose, throat and skin. Not only that, he tested and found that the mushroom extract did not destroy white blood cells and did not affect other tissues. Fleming named the mushroom-borne substance 'penicillin'. [2] But penicillin could not be produced in large quantities at that time. An Oxford University team consisting of Howard Florey and Ernest Chein achieved it 14 years later. The group also succeeded in finding other, safer antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients. Accolades and Awards In 1945, the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology was awarded to Alexander Fleming, Howard Florey, and Ernest Seine[3]. He was knighted by King George VI in 1944.[4] In 1999, Alexander Fleming was included in Time magazine's list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. Near the end of 2000, three prestigious journals from Sweden declared penicillin the greatest invention of the last millennium. In 2002, Alexander Fleming was included in the BBC's list of Britain's 100 Most Important People, as voted by the public.[5] An asteroid in the asteroid belt is named 91006 Fleming in memory of Alexander Fleming.

"A lullaby is a song sung to lull a baby to sleep. Talattu is one of the genres of Natar songs. The lullabies that were handed down as oral literature have been collected and compiled by natarial researchers. Lullabies are one of the genres of folk songs that are intertwined with the lives and feelings of the rural people. The lullabies are melodious. In this way, the child falls into a deep sleep. ""Tal"" means tongue. Rocking is also said to make a baby sleep by making a sound with the tongue. It is customary for a mother to rock her baby on her lap, shoulder, arms or cradle. It is also called worship as it is chanted through chants called Arara or Ariraro. Lullaby girls in Tindivanam regions sing “Lululai Lululai” by wagging their tongues and drawing the child's attention towards them. The music of the song is not the same. They stretch according to their will. The words Rararo, Arararo and Ariraro are used at the beginning, middle and end of the song. Lullabies are mostly sung in the melodious raga called Neelambari. However, they are also played in ragas such as Yathukulagambothi, Sakana, Anandabhairavi. Lullabies describe the beauty of a child, its toys, maternal pride, clan pride, etc. These Italian hymns deal with realistic similes and allegorical tropes.  Kovvai Magazine Daughter - N  Confused Navaratnam  Kattip Pasumponne - N  You are the eye of the eye   It is interesting to read that in the lullaby, the child is portrayed as Navaratnam, Pashumponna and Kanmani. In devotional literature, hymns have been sung to the Lord as a child. Lullaby in literature ""Uman Tarata Urangitete"" is written as Tarata in Muttollairath. Kambar Talattu is used in Kambaramayana to mean “the farm where the green toad sways”. Tirunnasambandar sings the sweetness of the lullaby as follows.  ""Pannamar is also soft-spoken  Hearing the sound of swaying Balagar  The aspirants were amazed  Even with the plane, this is Miglaya.   Periyazwar chants as follows.  “Gemstone  Interstitial tumor  Nail made of gold  He will give you Brahman by taking care of the colorful crib  Manik Kuralan! Talelo!  Do not hesitate!”   Kulasekhara Alwar rocking Iragavan is as follows  Gods and Asuras  Creator of the directions!  Everyone come and worship  Arangnagart Tuinaravana!  River Kaverin  Karumani in the moment!  Everyone is idolized!  Iragave Tale Lo”   Bhartiyar as follows,  “A child who sees animals in the forest becomes conscious  He calls the taste of the pot a viper.”   It is also believed that the infant knows the taste of the lullaby.[1] Kannadasan in his Krishna view[2]    At Ayarbadi House    Like a calf in its mother's lap    Mayakannan is sleeping    Talelo    He has a mouthful of dirt    After displaying the zone    He rests and sleeps    Araro    He rests and sleeps    Araro    (Pastoral…)    Of braided gopher    Cheek in cheek    Like Mannavan    Dalelo made the leel    He fell asleep under that spell    He was unconscious    Is the region asleep?

Even in a rich man's house, the mother cradles the child. The poor fishermen, cultivators, bandarams, blacksmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters and masons dance with Tamil music to the babies born in their homes. Alvars who saw the emotional upheaval of the mother coming like a wild flood in the lullaby, later poets etc. refined this type of song and composed songs in the form of Pillai Tamil and Devar Devi lullabies in Yapilakana katukop. The people of the farmland are singing to the song of the gods. In some lullabies we see the real baby and the lullaby mother before our eyes. Song 1 Cut the green leaves  cradled by coral  In the coral cradle  Balagane you sleep Hugging girl - dear you  In the picture pot  Siriamma smile - dear you  Chitra Poon is in the crib. A few more lullabies are full of relative glory. There are many songs in which Maman is proud. There are also humorous songs that make fun of Maman.

"solar system The Solar System or solar system is a system that includes the Sun and all the objects under the gravitational control of the Sun. The solar system includes the eight planets orbiting Katiravana, its 162 (so far known) moons, the Indus asteroids, the dwarf asteroids, and thousands of other celestial bodies. Comets, igneous rocks, meteorites and interstellar asteroids are also found in the solar system. the sun Sun is also a galaxy. It is the closest galaxy to Earth (different planets and different constellations). It's a fireball. So, you can't go near it. It is many times bigger than Earth. It is about 15 million kilometers away from Earth. The Sun is the source galaxy of the Solar System, at the center of the Solar System. Many planets including Earth, billions of meteors, comets and cosmic dust orbit the Sun in various orbits. It is noteworthy that the weight of the Sun alone accounts for 98.6 percent of the mass of the Solar System. The average distance between the Sun and the Earth is about 149,600,000 kilometers. A ray of light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes, 19 seconds to reach the Earth. Katiravan is composed largely of hydrogen (about 74% by mass, and 92% by volume) and helium (about 24% by mass, 7% by volume), with minor amounts of other elements, such as iron, nickel, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, magnesium, organic matter, neon, and calcium. , also contains chromium. Wednesday It is the closest planet to the Sun. So it will be very hot. It is called Mercury in English. Mercury is the smallest planet among all the planets. The diameter of this planet is 4800 km. It is less massive than the moon. Mercury takes 88 to go around the Sun once. As the Earth we live in rotates around itself once every twenty-four hours, day and night alternate for all parts of the earth. But on Mercury, day and night alternate for long periods. Meteorologists say that when Mercury is close to the Sun, the temperature of the sunlit area of ​​Katiravan is about 400 degrees Celsius and when it is far away it is about 280 degrees Celsius. As Mercury crawls in a straight line between the Earth and the Sun, it creeps across the image of the Sun as a tiny black dot. Instead of calling it a eclipse, it is called a New Moon. Friday Venus is the second planet from the sun. It is a very hot planet. Even matter melts in it. It is the closest planet to Earth. This can be seen in the early morning sky. This planet is said to be somewhat similar to Earth in size and mass. Its diameter is 12320 km. It takes 224 days to go around the Sun once. It also appears as a black spot when it comes in a straight line between the Sun and the Earth. This event is known as Venus Moon. This happens very rarely. Finally, it was held on the eighth of June in the year two thousand and four. Astronomers say that the next one will occur on June 6, 2012. This interplanetary cycle, which has an interval of eight years, may occur after two thousand and twelve centuries, and the cloud cover around the planet has evolved. This has made it difficult to accurately study the surface of Venus. Earth Our earth is the third planet in the solar system. It is a rock sphere. Earth is surrounded by atmosphere. Two-thirds of its surface is water. Living things are able to live here because of the presence of air and water. Although the Earth is accepted as spherical, it is not perfectly spherical. Both the poles are slightly flattened and the imaginary line at the equator is slightly convex. The diameter passing through the equator is 12742 km and the diameter between the poles is 12713 km. The Earth revolves around itself and also revolves around the Sun once in 365,2563 days. Every year on the 3rd of January the Earth comes closest to the Sun. The time taken for the earth to revolve once around itself is taken as a day and the time it takes to go around the sun once is taken as a year. The rotation of the earth causes day and night, and the rotation of the sun causes the seasons. tuesday Mars is the fourth planet. It is also called the Red Planet. A day on Mars is 24.5 hours and life on Mars has not yet been proven. Mars takes 687 days to go around the Sun once. It takes 24 hours and 37 minutes to revolve around itself. So like the Earth, day and night alternate there. Earth's axis is tilted twenty-three degrees. The seasons are similar to Earth's because the axis of Mars' rotation is tilted by twenty-four degrees. Since Mars takes almost twice as long to orbit the Sun as Earth does to orbit the sun, the climate is twice as long. Mars appears reddish yellow when viewed through a telescope. Thursday Jupiter is the fifth planet. It is the largest of the planets. It is called a 'giant planet' because its mass is larger than other planets. Jupiter is 1300 times bigger than Earth. Jupiter is made of gases. Jupiter has a large red region. A thin faint ring surrounds Jupiter. This ring is made of ice and dust. It takes 9 hours and 55 minutes to orbit itself once. So imagine how much faster this giant planet rotates than Earth. Whereas Jupiter takes eleven years and three hundred and fifteen days to go around the Sun once. When scientists analyzed the spectra obtained from Jupiter, they found the presence of gases such as ammonia and methane. The Earth we live on has only one satellite. But recently it has been discovered that there are sixteen satellites orbiting Jupiter. Sat Saturn is the sixth planet. It is the second major planet. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made of gases. Saturn is surrounded by massive rings that are flat circles. Saturn can be identified by these. Put this giant Saturn in water and it will float! Isn't it amazing? Because gases on Saturn are lighter (less dense) than water. Saturn's color is yellow. It takes 29.5 years to go around the Sun once. Uranus The seventh planet is Uranus. Like Saturn, Jupiter is made of gases. There are rings around it. Uranus is. Until 1781 it was believed that there were only six planets in the solar system. The planet Uranus was accidentally discovered by a scientist named William Harsha. Its diameter is 48000 km. It takes ten hours and forty eight minutes to rotate itself. It takes 84 years to go around the sun once. Uranus has five subplanets. Neptune Neptune is the eighth planet. When viewed through a telescope, it appears bluish-green in color. The planet was discovered in 1846 by scientists at the Berlin Astronomical Observatory. It orbits the Sun once every 165 years. Fifteen hours and forty minutes will pass by itself. As this planet is very far away from the sun, it is always cold. It has two components. One of these satellites orbits the mother planet in the opposite direction every six days. Nepriun cannot be seen by the naked eye.  Surya also has a family Scientists say that the planets in the sky that revolve around the sun, mainly visible to our eyes, belong to the solar system. The earth we live in also belongs to the solar system. Because the earth also revolves around the sun. A surprising pattern exists among the planets considered to belong to the solar system. All the planets, known as planets, orbit the sun in the equatorial path of the sun. It is amazing that all the planets revolve around the Sun in the same direction. Each of the planets, except Uranus, revolves around itself in a counter-clockwise direction. The Sun also revolves around itself in the same direction. There are many theories as to how a family of planets could have originated for the Sun. One theory is that due to a large shock to the Sun, some parts of the Sun broke into small pieces and started crawling around the Sun as separate planets. Another theory is that the Sun collided with another planet and the new planets formed and started orbiting the Sun. New solar system discovery European space scientists H.T. The star 10180 has been studied for the last 6 years at Lasilla, Chile. The research is being conducted with the help of a 3.6 meter telescope equipped with state-of-the-art technology. New solar system discovery with 7 planets In this situation HD They discovered a new solar system around the star 10180. It has 7 planets. Out of them 5 planets are very clearly visible. One of them looks like Saturn. Apart from these, there are also very small outer planets. This new solar system is 127 light-years away from Earth. It is similar to the existing solar system. Scientist Christophe Lowis has said that research is ongoing. [1] [2] ",Which is the nearest galaxy to earth?,And the sun,585
"Electronics is the field of science that deals with the control of electrical energy by means of electrons or electrons. Electronics or electronics is the basic technology used in the operation of many devices used in daily life such as light bulbs, clocks, telephones, radios, televisions, computers, etc. Electronics are used to store and manipulate information. That is, electrical signals can be generated. Information can be replaced by electronic signals. These signals or information can be stored or predicted by electronic devices. Active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, tri-resistors, dipoles, integrated circuits and photoelectric devices and sensors and electrical circuits made up of active electrical components such as resistors, capacitors and inductors play a major role in this field. So generally electronic devices consist of active semiconductors and active circuit elements. This circuit is called an electronic circuit. Electronics is considered a branch of physics and a branch of electrical engineering.[1][2] The passive behavior of active elements and their ability to control the flow of electrons help amplify even the weakest signal waves; This application plays a major role in the fields of information processing, telecommunications, signal processing or coding. And these tools can also be used as transformers; This application is useful in numerical data processing. Integrated circuit technologies, package circuit technologies, and various connection technologies complete the circuit function of circuit boards and make them work as a whole or a system through mixed electronic components. Electrical, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Electronics is different from electronics and electrical engineering; Electrical engineering generally deals with electrification, conduction, distribution, and the transformation and storage of voltage or current and the conversion of electrical energy to other forms of energy and from other forms of energy to electrical energy. These components include wires, drivers, alternators, batteries, transformers, sensors, transformers, and resistors. The separation of electronics from electronics dates back to 1906, when electronic amplifiers were used to increase the amplitude and power of weak signals. Until the 1950s, the field was initially called ""radio technology"" because its primary use was in radio transmitters, receivers and vacuum tubes. Today, most electronic devices use semiconductors to control currents. The science and technology of semiconductor devices is considered a branch of material physics; The design and development of electronic circuits as a solution to practical problems evolved into the field of electronic engineering. Branches of Electronics Electronics is divided into following branches: Numerical or Numerical Electronics Analog Electronics Microelectronics Circular design Integrated circuits Optoelectronics Semiconductor (semiconductor) devices The package surrounds History of Electrical Components Vacuum tubes (thermoelectric gates) were the first electronic devices.[3] These led to the electronic revolution in the first half of the twentieth century.[4][5] These led to the technological systems of radio, television, music records, radar (wave-range and sound-field), long-distance telephone, and many other technologies. These were fundamental elements of high-efficiency microwave and television receivers until the 1980s.[6] In the 1980s, solid state devices took their place. Vacuum tubes are still in use today in specialized applications such as high-efficiency radio frequency amplifiers and cathode ray tubes, guitar amplifiers for special acoustic instruments, and microwave equipment such as cavitational amplifiers. IBM first used resistors in the IBM 608 computing device in April 1955. It was the first all-three-dimensional calculator to hit the commercial market.[7][8] The IBM 608 calculator used more than 3000 Germanic transistors. Thomas J. Watson mandated that only three resistors be used on IBM devices. Since then only tristors have been used in computer logic and other peripherals. A fundamental tool in electronics technology is the resistor. After its discovery, the field has grown tremendously. Below are some historical events of electricity. 1897 - Electron, one of the atomic particles, was discovered by J. J. Thomson. found out 1904 - John Ambrose Fleming invents the thermoelectric tube. It is a triad similar to triads in operation. 1947 - William Shockley, John Burdean, and Walter Brattain discover the triad. 1940-1950 - Development of the computer 1959 - Jack Gilby invents the integrated chip. 2000 - Fish triad Electronic instruments and components thumbnail| Electronic components  An electronic component is any material in an electronic system that affects the electrons or their associated fields in order for the system to function as expected. These components are usually among other components connected to perform a specific function (as an amplifier, radio receiver, or oscillator). (Usually soldered onto a circuit board.) Electronic components can be packaged individually or in more complex integrated chip-like modules. Some common electronic components are: Capacitors, Inductors, Resistors, Diode, Trio. Electronic components are classified into active components (triodes, diodes) and passive components (resistors, capacitors). Vacuum tubes are one of the first electronic components to be invented. These were the primary operating components until the mid-1980s.[6] Since the 1980s, solid state instruments have replaced these. Today, vacuum tubes are still used in some specialized applications, such as high-power amplifiers, cathode ray tubes, professional audio equipment, and microwave equipment. Types of Circuits Circuits and Latin components can be divided into two categories: oscilloscopes and oscilloscopes. Either one or a combination of these may be used in a particular instrument. Analog circuits Most microwave devices, such as radio sets, are built with some basic circuitry. In these the amplitude of the voltage is continuous without any break. In the numerical method (numerical) the voltage is gradually spaced. There are tens of thousands of oscilloscope circuits, ranging from oscilloscopes with a single input element to complex circuits that contain many elements. These are sometimes called linear circuits. However, in resonant mixers, transducers, etc., they are non-linear. Complete waveguide circuits are not found in modern circuits. Mostly octal circuits are found. Only certain parts are arranged in waveform; These are called composite circuits. Numerical circuits In arithmetic circuits the voltages can have many discrete values. For example, 1 volt, 1.5 volt, 2 volt are used. There will be no 1.25 volts etc. between these. These represent a real-time representation of a mathematical type called a Boolean array. All digital computers operate on this basis. Many digital circuits operate with two voltage states, ""0"" and ""1"", in an analog digital system. Often the charge ""0"" is the lower voltage (called ""LOW"") and the charge ""1"" is the higher voltage (called ""HIGH""). Computers, electronic watches, programmable logic controllers are built with numerical circuits.

"Alexander Graham Bell (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was a scientist, engineer, inventor, teacher and scientist. Known for inventing the telephone. He was a British citizen in his youth. He later became an American citizen.""[1][2] His mother and wife were deaf, which may have been an impetus for his research. [3] His research led to the invention of the telephone in 1876. He was also the founder of the Bell Telephone Company. Life  youth Alexander Bell was born on 3 March 1847 in Edinburgh, Scotland.[4] He was named Alexander Graham Bell in honor of his family friend, Alexander Graham Bell. Two brothers. Both of them died of tuberculosis.[7] Her father, Alexander Melville Bell, was a professor. His mother was Eliza Grace.[N 2] His grandfather who lived in London, his uncle in Dublin and his father Alexander Melville Bell in Edinburgh were all professed elocutionists by profession. How to show different emotions with eye movements? How can a deaf person understand a person's speech by the movement of the lips? Bell's father wrote several books about it.[8][9] By the age of eight, Graham was a proficient piano player.[8] At the age of ten, he lost his inclination to go to school.[10] Instead of studying Latin and Greek, he spent his time playing the piano and researching sound waves.[11] He fell in love with a deaf woman and married her when he was engaged in research into converting speech into electrical sound.    Assignments Graham Bell's family immigrated to Canada.[13] While living in Boston, Bell established a school to train deaf school teachers.[14][15][16] In it he taught the basics of speech [17]. His research and knowledge became so widespread that Boston University hired him as a professor of speech organology. Study Bell played the piano and transmitted the music to a certain distance through electricity. Only sounds were sent by telegraph. At the age of 18, Graham realized that speeches could also be sent in that manner. So he engages in those efforts [18] . At that time human voices were transmitted from one place to another through telegraphs. Those methods were very helpful in his research. By 1875 these efforts were partially successful. At first I was able to send indistinct audio. In 1876 Bell spoke to his assistant Watson who made the world's first telephone. The first phrase he spoke on the phone was ""Watson, come here, I want to see you"".[19] Watson could clearly hear these words.[20] But no one cares about the phone that Bell invented so he is very tired. He put his phone on display at an exhibition in Philadelphia. The glory of the telephone spread everywhere after the king of Brazil who came there was amazed and used it. He received a patent for the telephone on 7 March 1876 with the help of his father-in-law in America.[21] [22][23] In 1877, he founded a telephone company called ""Bell Telephone Company"" along with his assistant Watson. With a prize of 50,000 francs awarded to him by the French government for the invention of the telephone, he established an organization called the Volta Laboratory.[24] Findings   Bell didn't just stop with telephones. He invented instruments such as photophone[25][26][27], audio meter[28][29][30][31], metal detector[32], induction balance, wax recording cylinder, gramophone, etc. through a government agency. Bell was also involved in trying to find the plane. But it did not win him. But he made some discoveries.  Bell was the inventor of the aileron. He later succeeded in reforming seaplanes.[33] He introduced innovation in goat rearing. He also planned to create female goats that would give birth to twins each time. He invented a rare device that could help soldiers trying to find refuge in deserts by filtering the excess moisture from the air. Founded an association to promote speech training for the deaf [34]. Bell also contributed to Helen Keller, the inventor of Braille for the blind.[35] He was interested in creating a world English based on phonology. One of the highlights of Bell's history is the fact that he received patents for 59 inventions, both individually and with other scientists. specialties He became an American citizen in 1882. He was one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society in 1888 and became its second president.[36] He has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history.[37] Legion of Honor awarded by the French Government Academic Franchise Award[38] Volta Prize[39][40][41][42][43][44] Royal Society of Arts (London), Albert Medal (1902) Doctoral degree awarded by the University of Ursburg Edison Medal (1914) He received various honors and awards like disappearance Alexander Graham Bell died on 2 August 1922 in Paddock, United States.[45] On the day of his death, all telephones in the United States went silent for 5 minutes in tribute.[46] Patents Improvement in Transmitters and Receivers for Electric Telegraphs, filed March 1875, issued April 1875 (multiplexing signals on a single wire) Improvement in Telegraphy, filed February 14, 1876, issued March 7, 1876 (Bell's first telephone patent) Improvement in Telephonic Telegraph Receivers, filed April 1876, issued June 1876 Improvement in Generating Electric Currents (using rotating permanent magnets), filed August 1876, issued August 1876 Electric Telegraphy (permanent magnet receiver), filed January 15, 1877, issued January 30, 1877 Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone, filed August 1880, issued December 1880 Aerial Vehicle, filed June 1903, issued April 1904 footnote  Quotations  Supplementary texts  Alexander Graham Bell (booklet).

"World War I was a global war. However, this was mostly done in Europe. In this war, France, Russia, Britain, and the United States, known as the Allies, and Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy, known as the Central Powers, fought on opposite sides. Its scale and concentration were unprecedented. A large number of people were involved in the fighting and a large amount of losses were incurred. About 70 million warriors, including 60 million Europeans, were involved in the fighting. New technologies such as machine guns, superior heavy artillery, improved transportation, toxic ordnance, aerial warfare, and submarines greatly increased the impact of the war. 40 million people were injured and killed in the war. About 20 million people died, both civilians and combatants. Due to war, sieges, revolutions, ethnic cleansing and epidemics, the sufferings of the people increased. This war was fought from 1914 to 1918. The war had major political and commercial consequences throughout the rest of the 20th century. As a result of the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire were disintegrated. The Cherumanian Empire was overthrown. It lost huge tracts of land. Due to these effects, the boundaries of countries in Europe and the Middle East were changed. Many commonwealths and republics emerged in place of the old monarchies. With the aim of preventing such a war from happening again, a League of Nations was formed for the first time in the history of the world. The agreements made to end the war and the instability of the newly formed countries were the main reasons for another world war 20 years later. The unification of Germany in 1871 and the uneasy balance of power among the European powers at the beginning of the 20th century were among the main causes of the war. In addition to this, France's resentment of territorial losses to Germany in the 19th century; Economic, military, and colonial rivalries between Germany and Britain; Further reasons for this war were the continued instability of Austro-Hungarian rule in the Balkans. The immediate cause of the war was the shooting (June 28, 1914) of Austria's Crown Prince Francis Ferdinand and his wife while riding in a car. Suttavan hails from Gavrilo Principe, Serbia. As a result, Austria invaded the Kingdom of Serbia in revenge. Following this many alliances were formed. The war soon spread to the entire world as many European countries had imperial borders in many parts of the world. Within weeks, most of Europe was at war. The war was fought mainly between two alliances, the Allies and the Central Powers. On the Allied side initially were France, the United Kingdom, Russia and their associated empires. Later many countries joined this alliance. In particular, Japan joined in August 1914, Italy in April 1915, and the United States in April 1917. The alliance, known as the Central Powers because of its location in the center of Europe, consisted of Germany, Austria and their associated empires. The Ottoman Empire joined the alliance in October 1914. Bulgaria joined it a year later. Fighter planes, warships and submarines were used for the first time in this war. At the end of the war, only the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, and the Scandinavian countries of Monaco remained neutral in Europe. However, some of these countries may have provided financial aid to belligerent countries. The war mostly took place on several fronts around continental Europe. The western end was an area of ​​bunkers and ramparts, separated by no-man's land[1]. These were located 475 miles (over 600 km) apart[1]. This came to be known as bunker warfare. The Eastern Front was not as invincible as the Western Front, as it had vast open spaces and lacked much of a rail network. However, the war was fierce. Fierce fighting also took place on the Balkan front, the Middle Eastern front and the Italian front. Also, battles took place in the sea and in the air. Reasons  On June 28, 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, in Sarajevo. Princip was a member of Young Bosnia, an organization that aimed to unify the southern Slavic regions and liberate them from Austria-Hungary. The murder in Sarajevo was followed by a rapid succession of events that led to full-scale war.[2] Austria-Hungary asked Serbia to take strict action against those responsible for the murder. However, Austria-Hungary felt that Serbia was not listening and went to war with Serbia. Many of the European countries had to go to war because of the many collective security treaties they had with each other and the complex international alliances. Arms race  Although Germany did not have the commercial advantages of a large empire like Britain, by 1914 the country's industry had surpassed Britain's. Thus, both countries built massive warships in the years leading up to the war to keep their respective navies strong. This naval rivalry between the two countries intensified in 1906 with the launch of the battleship HMS Dreadnought. The size and power of this battleship made her predecessors obsolete. Britain maintained its naval preeminence in other fields as well. David Stevenson describes this arms race as a self-reinforcing peak of military preparedness.""[3] David Herrmann saw the shipbuilding race as a move towards war.[4] However, Neil Ferguson argued that because Britain had the strength to maintain its leading position, it was imminent. He argued that this could not be the reason for the war.[5] This arms race affected both Britain and Germany, with the total expenditure on arms by the Great Powers of Britain, Germany, France, and Austria-Hungary between 1908 and 1913. assembled.[6] Plans, disbelief, mobilization  Many political scholars believe that the mobilization programs carried out in Germany, France and Russia intensified the conflicts themselves. Because of the complexities of deploying, moving, and equipping millions of troops, plans for readiness had to be initiated well in advance. Such preparation also made it necessary for countries to launch an attack immediately. In particular, the historian Fritz Fischer highlighted the inherent seriousness of Germany's Scheelpen Plan. Germany had to fight on two fronts and needed to eliminate the enemy quickly on one front and focus on the other front. Thus, the plan was to capture Belgium with a strong attack and disable the French forces before they were ready. The plan was then for the German troops to move east along the railway line and destroy the slowly preparing Russian forces. France's Plan 17 aimed to attack the Ruhr Valley, the industrial heartland of Germany. In theory, this would eliminate Germany's ability to engage in modern warfare. Russia's Plan 19 envisioned launching simultaneous attacks against Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottomans. However, according to the revised Plan 19, Austria-Hungary was the primary target. This reduces the need to send troops against East Prussia. All three schemes were based on the idea that quick action determined success. Detailed timetables were prepared. Once preparations for war begin there is very little chance of looking back. Militarism and Valor Former US President Woodrow Wilson and others blamed militarism for the war.[7] Some argue that the war was the result of authoritarians and military leaders in countries such as Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary who had amassed powers and their desire to suppress democracy and increase military power.[8] This concept was heavily used in anti-German propaganda.[9][10] By 1918, as Germany's efforts began to fail, there were calls for the resignation of leaders such as Kaiser Wilhelm II. Also, there were general demands for an end to militarism and aristocracy. This basis paved the way for America's participation in the war after Russia surrendered in 1917.[11] Great Britain and France, major allies of the Allied Powers, were democracies. These fought against authoritarian countries like Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. One of the Allies, Russia remained an empire until 1917, although it resisted the oppression of the Slavic people by Austria-Hungary. Against this backdrop, the war was initially seen as a war between democracy and dictatorship. However, this lost its credibility as the war continued. Wilson believed that the League of Nations and disarmament would bring lasting world peace. H. G. Following a quote from Wells, he described the war as ""the war to end all wars"". He was willing to fight alongside Britain and France even when they were mired in militarism to achieve the goal of ending the war. Fritz Fischer blamed Germany's authoritarian leaders for the war[12]. Germany's Social Democratic Party had won several elections. They increased their vote share and became the majority party in 1912. However the twisted ones had lesser powers compared to the Kaiser. It was feared that there was a high possibility of a kind of political revolution in this environment. In Russia there was also a military buildup and reforms to be carried out in 1916-1917. Before this, Russia was defeated in the war and Germany was on the verge of reunification. In his later writings, Fischer argued that Germany had planned for war as early as 1912[13]. Historian Samuel R. Williamson emphasized Austria-Hungary's contribution to the war. He felt that Serbian nationalism and Russia's ambitions in relation to the Balkans had undermined the monarchy, which consisted of 17 different nationalities. He opined that Austria-Hungary expected a limited war against Serbia, and that strong German support would keep Russia out of the war and reduce its prestige in the Balkans[14]. Balance of power  The goal of the foreign policies of the great powers in the pre-war period was to maintain the balance of power. It is associated with extensive networks of overt and covert alliances and agreements. After the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), for example, Britain wanted a strong Germany to balance the strength of its arch-enemy, France. But when Germany sought to build up its navy to challenge Britain's navy, Britain changed its position. Looking for help to counter the German threat, France turned to Russia as an ally. Facing a threat from Russia, Austria-Hungary sought German support. After World War I began, such treaties only partially decided which country fought on which side. Italy had made treaties with Austria-Hungary and Germany. However, it did not go to war on behalf of those countries. It was later in favor of the Allies. The most significant treaty of all was the first defense treaty between Germany and Austria-Hungary. This was extended by Germany in 1909, pledging that Germany would remain on its side even if Austria-Hungary started a war.[15] Economic imperialism Vladimir Lenin attributed the war to imperialism. He is Karl Marx, English economist John A. Hobson et al. [16] They predicted that competition for expanding markets would create global conflicts. Lenin pointed out that Britain's pre-eminent economic position was threatened by the extensive development of the German industrial sector, and that because Germany did not have the advantages of a large economy, it had to fight inevitably with Britain for places for German capital. This argument was very popular during the war and also contributed to the development of communalism. Trade barriers Cordell Hull, Secretary of the Interior under Franklin Roosevelt in the United States, believed that trade barriers were the root cause of both World War I and World War II. In 1944, he helped create the Bretton Woods Agreement to reduce trade barriers that he believed were the causes of conflict.[17][18] Ethnic and political rivalries As Austria-Hungary's influence in the Balkans declined and the Broad-Sylvia movement grew, war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia was considered inevitable. Ethno-nationalism coincided with the rise of Serbia, where anti-Austrian sentiment was high. Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1878, a former province of the Ottoman Empire and predominantly Serb. In 1908 it was formally annexed to Austria-Hungary. The growth of rising ethnic sentiments coincided with the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Due to ethnic and religious ties and rivalry with Austria dating back to the Crimean War, Russia favored the Pan-Serbia movement. The reasons for this were the failed Russo-Austrian treaty and Russia's centuries-old interest in Balkan ports.[19] July crisis and declaration of war  The Austro-Hungarian government sought to deal with the Serbian issue using the murder of the crown prince as a pretext. Germany also supported it. On July 23, 1914, Austria-Hungary imposed a deadline of ten demands on Serbia. Some of these demands were so severe that Serbia refused to accept the sixth demand, expressing doubts about its feasibility. Serbia expressed its willingness to accept this sixth demand in the initial drafts of the response, but Serbia, relying on Russian support, later deleted it in the final draft. It also issued an order for readiness. Austria-Hungary instead declared war on 28 July. Initially Russia ordered a partial alert targeting the Austrian border. However, after Russian commanders informed the Czar that partial readiness was not possible, a full readiness order was issued on 31 July. Germany's Schlieben Plan for the war was based on a quick attack on France, so Germany could not allow Russia to prepare. Thus, on August 1, Germany declared war on Russia. Two days later war was declared on France. It then went through neutral Belgium to march towards Paris. Britain had confirmed Belgium's neutrality in a treaty concluded in connection with the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Because of this, Britain also had to intervene in the war. Also five of the six European powers were involved in the war. It was the largest battle fought on the continent of Europe since the Napoleonic era.[20] Chronology of events Initial activities Confusion among the core countries The war strategy of the Central Powers suffered due to communication failures. Germany had agreed to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia. However, there were differences between the two countries regarding its interpretation. Austro-Hungarian leaders expected Germany to accept the task of taking care of Russia on their northern border. But Germany planned to send most of the Austro-Hungarian forces to the border with Russia, while they dealt with France. Due to this confusion, the Austro-Hungarian forces had to be split up and sent to the Russian border and Serbia. African Operations One of the opening operations of the war involved Britain, France, and Germany and took place in Africa. On 7 August, British and French forces entered the German protectorate of Togoland. On 10 August German forces in South West Africa invaded South Africa. Serious attacks in Africa were also sporadic throughout the war.  Serbian invasion Serbian forces were engaged from 12 August in what was known as the Battle of Szczecin against Austria-Hungary. These launched a defensive attack from the southern banks of the rivers Trina and Sava. Over the next two weeks the Austro-Hungarian offensive suffered setbacks with heavy losses. It was the first significant victory of the Allies and dashed Austria's dreams of a quick victory. As a result, Austria had to commit most of its forces to the Serbian front, weakening the Russian front. German forces in Belgium and France The initial border battles (14 August–24 August) saw several German victories. However, as Russia attacked East Prussia, the German forces that had to fight on the western front had to be diverted. Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the Battle of Tannenburg (17 August – 2 September). However, as attention was diverted by the Russian war, problems arose on the other front, which German commanders had not anticipated due to insufficient speed. According to the Schlieben Plan, German forces on the right were to advance west of Paris. However, the lack of space and speed of horse-drawn transport caused German supplies to suffer. British and French forces finally stopped the German forces east of Paris in what became known as the First Battle of the Marne (5 September–12 September). This left the Central Powers with no chance of a quick victory and forced them to fight on two fronts. German forces were safe and secure in France, permanently disabling 230,000 British French forces. This is more than Germany lost. Asia and Pacific Regions  New Zealand annexed what was then German Samoa, now known as Western Samoa, on 30 August. On 11 September, Australian naval and army forces landed on the island of New Pomerania, now known as New Britain, then part of German New Guinea. and the Micronesian settlements of Germany; After the Battle of Tsingtao, Japan also captured Tsingtao, a German coal port in China's Shandong Province. Within months, Allied forces had captured all German territories in the Pacific. Initial stages Ambush warfare begins Military strategies prior to World War I had failed to keep pace with technological developments. Now, most wars have developed impressive defense systems that cannot be penetrated by outdated methods. Barbed wire fences largely impeded the advance of infantry. Long range heavy weapons were capable of inflicting more damage than those of 1870 and, together with machine guns, made it difficult for troops to cross open fields. In this war, Germany introduced poison gas as a weapon. Soon the opposition also started using it. However, it does not seem to have played an important role in winning battles. The effects of the toxic materials were horrific. The victims died slowly and painfully. In this war, toxic materials were the source of the greatest fear and evoked the most horrific memories. Both team commanders had failed to find a means of blowing up the bunker positions without massive casualties. With the passage of time, new offensive weapons were developed with the help of technology. Notable among these is the ""Bearer"". It was mainly used by Britain and France. Germany also used what it captured from them and the limited number of carriers it developed. After the First Battle of the Marne, the Allied and German forces undertook a series of circular maneuvers known as the Race to the Sea. Britain and France had to face German forces fighting from bunkers stretching from Lorraine to the Flemish coast of Belgium. While Britain and France were on the offensive, Germany's forces were focused on defending the captured territories. Thus, German bunkers were better prepared for defense than those of the enemy. But the British and French bunkers were only temporary until the German defenses could be penetrated. Both sides could use scientific and technological developments to change this status quo where no one could succeed. In April 1915, Germany was the first to use chlorine as a resource, in defiance of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. As the Allies retreated from the areas where this weapon had been used, the Germans were able to create a 6 kilometers (4 mi) long salient in their forward positions. Canadian forces closed the breach at the Second Battle of Ypres.  July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, was a memorable day for the British forces. The loss to the troops on this day was 57,470 men. Of this, 19,240 people died. Most of the damage occurred within the first hour of the attack. British casualties during the entire Somme offensive were around five hundred thousand men[21]. For the next two years neither side was able to inflict a decisive defeat on the other side. However, German operations at Verdun throughout 1916 and the Allied defeat at the Somme brought France's forces close to collapse. The futile frontal attacks and the rigid adherence to practical tactics caused heavy losses to the British and French forces and led to widespread military mutinies. Throughout the period from 1915 to 1917, the British Empire and France suffered more losses than Germany due to the war tactics and strategies adopted. While Germany launched only one major offensive during the Battle of Worden, the Allies launched several offensives to penetrate German positions. In terms of strategic encirclement, Germany's defensive policy was suited to ambush warfare, with light forward positions that could sustain casualties and critical positions that could readily mount strong counterattacks. This helped in repulsing enemy attacks with minimal losses. On the whole, casualties in both attack and defense were massive. Around 800,000 soldiers were on the Western Front on behalf of the British Empire at any given time. 1000 battalions were stationed from the North Sea to the River Orne in a four-phase rotation for a month. This method was observed during non-attacks. The front consisted of over 9,600 kilometers (5,965mi) of bunkers. Each battalion worked for a week in its forward positions, then moved to rear support positions and worked there for another week. The next day they will move back from there and will be in reserve positions. On the fourth day, he leaves the positions and rests. The only notable British victory at the Battle of Arras in 1917 was the capture of Vimy Ridge. Canadian troops led by Sir Arthur Currie and Julian Byng captured it. The attacking forces were the first to capture the positions and quickly fortify and hold them, securing the coal-rich plain of Douai.[22] naval warfare  At the start of the war, the German Empire had ships with some degree of offensive capability in many parts of the world. These were later used to attack Allied merchant ships. The British Royal Navy attacked and destroyed those ships. However, certain predicaments arose where merchant ships could not be protected. For example, Emton, a light cruiser of the East Asia Squadron based in Tsingtao, destroyed 15 merchant ships and sank a Russian light cruiser and a French destroyer. However, the armed ships Skarnost, Niesenö, light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipsic and two transports from Germany's East Asia Division were not given orders to attack merchant ships. They headed for Germany. En route, German ships, including the cruiser Dresden, were engaged by the British fleet, sinking two armed vessels in the Battle of Coronel. However, in the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914, all ships except Testen were destroyed [23]. At the start of the war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany. Although this strategy succeeded in cutting off supplies of vital military and civilian needs to Germany, it violated international law that had been accepted by various international treaties over the previous two centuries.[24] Britain planted sea traps in the international maritime boundaries to prevent any ship from entering any part of the sea. It also posed a danger to neutral ships.[25] Since there was little resistance to this strategy, Germany expected the same for its indefinite submarine warfare.[26]  The Battle of Jutland in 1916 became the largest naval engagement of World War I. This is the only full-scale naval battle of the day. It took place on 31 May 1916 in the North Sea off Jutland. The Kaiserliche Fleet under Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer clashed with the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. With the war in a no-win situation, the German fleet, unable to cope with Britain's large fleet, retreated. However, they inflicted heavy losses on the British fleet. Nevertheless, it was an event that cemented Britain's dominance at sea. And throughout the rest of the war, Germany's ships remained in its ports. German U-boats attempted to cut off supply traffic between the United States and Britain.[27] It is the nature of submarine warfare that attacks come without warning. This leaves merchant ships with very little chance of escape.[28] The United States objected to this. As a result, Germany made changes to its offensive strategy. Following the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915, Germany pledged not to attack passenger ships. Meanwhile Britain armed its merchant ships. This made them exempt from safety regulations for non-combatant ships. Finally, Germany, realizing that America was about to enter the war, decided to adopt a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.[29] Germany's objective was to choke off the Allied sea lanes before the US could send out large numbers of troops. As merchant ships began to move in squadrons with the protection of destroyers, the threat from U-boats diminished. This strategy made the U-bots targets non-existent. This reduced the losses. The introduction of new equipment also created opportunities to attack submarines under the sea. The strategy of going in squadrons caused delays in deliveries as the ships had to wait for them to converge. Aircraft carriers were also first used in World War I. Sopwith Camels launched from the aircraft carrier HMS Furious in 1918 successfully attacked the Zeppelin airfield at Tondurne. As well as from this, blimp (blimp) aircraft were used to monitor submarines.[30] Southern Fronts Balkan War Having to fight Russia, Austria-Hungary could only use a third of its forces to attack Serbia. After heavy losses, the Austrians briefly captured the Serbian capital, Belgrade. At the end of 1914, the Serbs drove the Austrians out of the country in a counteroffensive known as the Battle of Kolubara. During the first 10 months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its reserve forces to fight Italy. Germany and Austria-Hungary got Bulgaria to agree to attack Serbia. Austria-Hungary's provinces of Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia provided Austria-Hungary with troops to invade Serbia and fight Russia and Italy. Montenegro sided with Serbia. Serbia was conquered in less than a month. The Central Powers launched an offensive from the north in October. Four days later Bulgaria also began to attack from the south. Faced with defeat on two fronts, the Serbian forces retreated to Albania. They halted their retreat only once to engage the Bulgarians. The Serbs lost the Battle of Kosovo. Montenegro helped the Serbs retreat through the Battle of Mojkovac on 6–7 January 1916. However Austria eventually annexed Montenegro as well. Serbian troops sailed to Greece. Diaries of British War Soldiers As part of events marking the centenary of the First World War, the diaries of British soldiers who took part in the war are being published online by Britain's National Archives. 1.5 million diary pages are preserved by the National Archives. Of these, a fifth of the pages have been digitally preserved as of 2014. The notes written in these digitally preserved 1944 diaries describe the experiences of the first cavalry and seven infantry divisions used in the Battle of Britain. Apart from the official diaries, some personal diaries written by British soldiers participating in the war have also been digitally preserved and are available online. The personal diary written by Captain James Patterson of the 1st Battalion has also been preserved in digital form. The world's last First World War veteran, Claude Soules, died in Australia in 2011 at the age of 110. It is said that people will listen.[31] See also these World War II Anzac Day 11.11.11.

"Nelson Mandela (Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was the first democratically elected President of South Africa. Before that he was one of the main leaders who fought against apartheid. Initially a believer in non-violence, he later headed the military wing of the African National Congress. They waged unconventional guerilla warfare against the apartheid government. Mandela's 27 years in prison is a widely publicized testimony of the brutality of apartheid. He spent most of his imprisonment in a small prison cell on Robben Island. After his release in 1990, a new republic of South Africa peacefully blossomed. Mandela became one of the most respected leaders in the world. Mandela led apartheid-ridden South Africa to the glimmer of democracy. His political journey continued as a peace fighter, armed struggle leader, convicted of treason, languished in prison for 27 years and then released as the President of the Republic and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Soon announced her retirement from public life in 2008. youth Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in the village of Kulu in South Africa. His father was a leader of the Xhosa tribe[1]. His father had four wives. 13 children 4 boys and 9 girls. Mandela was the son of his third wife. His full name is 'Nelson Robisala Mandela'. Commonly called Nelson Mandela. He was known as a boxer in his childhood.  Mandela, who was the first from the family to go to school, attended school while herding goats and cows at a young age. He also studied martial arts. It is noteworthy that the ""Nelson"" in front of his name was given to him by the teacher of the first school he attended. A keen scholar, Mandela also pursued graduate studies at universities in London and South Africa. In 1941 he went to Johannesburg and studied law part-time. Worked as a gold mine security officer and plantation agent. Then he married a nurse named 'Nomadham Shankar'. Mandela was actively involved in the African National Congress movement and his wife had a falling out. The South African government subsequently banned the African National Congress Party. Mandela was prosecuted. Winnie Madiki married Lena in 1958 while the trial was going on for five years. Winnie was fighting for her husband's principles. Mandela has 3 children by his first wife and 2 children by his 2nd wife. Politics Moral struggles Black people live in the majority of the country of South Africa. Whites are a minority there. But the ruling power remained with the whites. In 1939, at the age of 21, he rallied black youth and declared, 'Black people are oppressed. They are denied the right to vote. They have to obtain permission within their own country to travel. Black people were prohibited from owning land. These are against indigenous people. unjust. ""We have to fight against these things,"" he said, and found success in awakening black people.[3] Joined the African National Congress in 1943.[4] The government that took over South Africa in 1948 took unfair measures against the black population. Mandela and his university friend, Oliver Rumbo, worked together to provide legal advice to black people who were subject to racial exclusion. Mandela jumped into politics in anger after learning that racism and oppression were staged with the support of the state. He became the head of the African National Congress, a party formed to protect the interests of blacks. Its leader, Nelson Mandela, fought against racist white rule. Under his leadership, moral struggles against the racist policies of the government started sprouting. Seeing his non-violent struggle develop, the white government arrested him in 1956 as a revolutionary against the government. But the charges were dropped after a four-year trial.[4] Mandela was active after his release from prison. Because of this, the African National Congress grew rapidly in the 1960s. In 1960, he led a protest against the granting of special passports to Africans in Sarapiville. 69 people were killed in police firing. On December 5, 1956, Mandela and about 150 of his comrades were arrested on charges of treason. All were acquitted in 1961 after a long legal battle. Armed struggles  After this, Mandela felt that he could not get his rights through a crusade and resorted to armed means. After this, the white police decided to arrest him. In 1961, Mandela emerged as the armed forces leader of the African National Congress. He also participated in the creation of this. He received money and military aid from friendly foreign powers and coordinated guerrilla-style attacks on government and military headquarters. On December 16, 1961, Mandela led the first offensive against apartheid. Mandela went into hiding in 1961 due to severe government repression. A warrant was issued for his arrest. But later, the public was also affected by the activities of the organizations he headed. His anti-apartheid campaign was accused of violating human rights. The United States also labeled him a terrorist because of this. Mandela was barred from entering the United States until 2008. On August 5, 1962, he was surrounded and arrested by the police, who disguised himself and entered the area where he was staying. As planned, the white government arrested and imprisoned 10 prominent African National Congress leaders, including Mandela. Allegations of revolution against the government, disturbing the peace and inciting riots were made. This case was referred to as the Rivonia process in 1963. He was accused of trying to overthrow the South African government. Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment on June 12, 1964. He was 46 years old then. His imprisonment started that day and continued for 27 years. Jail Mandela was imprisoned in 1962. He spent almost 27 years in prison. In the history of the world, there are no leaders who have languished in prison for such a long time as Mandela. The South African government tortured him in solitary confinement for many years. He was denied permission even to meet his wife. In 1988, he contracted severe tuberculosis and went to the brink of death. So he was transferred to house arrest. Struggles for Mandela's release Demands for Mandela's release rose across the world. But Ponta, who was the leader of South Africa's apartheid regime, refused to release Mandela. Demonstrations and marches continued, led by Mandela's wife, to press for Mandela's release. The South African government expressed its desire that ""if we ask for forgiveness, we will release."" But Mandela refused to apologise. There was a regime change in South Africa and De Klerk took office as the new president. He offered to free Mandela. As a result, the world was eagerly waiting for the day of Mandela's release. Spoken words Mandela engaged in negotiations with the De Klerk government regarding his demands and received many of his demands from them. These negotiations played an important role in South Africa's later development as a democratic country. liberation Frederick William de Klerk, the then Prime Minister of South Africa The ban on the African National Congress was lifted and Mandela was officially released on February 11, 1990.[5] Mandela was released from prison in 1990. He was 71 years old when he was released. The event was televised live around the world[6]. Mandela was released on the evening of February 11, 1990, as announced by the South African government. Preparations were made around the world to welcome Mandela. On behalf of India, Prime Minister V. B. A reception committee was formed under the chairmanship of Singh. Mandela was escorted out of prison by his wife Winnie. African heads of state and a large number of volunteers greeted him with enthusiasm and joy at the prison gate. Mandela was then escorted safely to Cape Town by guards. Television and photography experts from various countries took pictures of him at the prison gate. Mandela's release was televised live across South Africa. Many world leaders welcomed Mandela's release. On his return to Cape Town, Mandela spoke to African National Congress members. He said:- The international community must continue to campaign to isolate the apartheid regime. My release alone will not be the necessary basis for negotiation. The future of our country should be decided by a democratically elected body without color difference. White imperialism over political power must end. Blacks should have equal rights. Until then we will fight. Democracy, Elections, South African Presidency He became the President of South Africa on 10 May 1994. President Anappin arranged for Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Gujarati and Urdu to be taught in South African schools from 1998.[7] Nobel laureate Nelson Mandela stepped down in 1999 after being elected and serving as South Africa's first black president. He refused to run for the post of president for the second time. Actions for Truth and Reconciliation After a long struggle, Mandela engaged in various activities to bring about reconciliation between the oppressors and the oppressed. Chief among them was the setting up of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to establish a mechanism to seek truth and justice without retribution. Throughout the history of the world, this system is considered as a good model for slaves to know the truth, forgive and live in harmony. Health On June 8, 2013, Mandela was admitted to a hospital in Pretoria due to ill health. South African President Jacob Zuma's office announced on 23 June 2013 that his health was critical.[8] President Jacob Zuma canceled his visit to Mozambique on 27 June 2013 as Mandela's health continued to deteriorate. All of Nelson Mandela's close relatives were rushed to his native home. They prayed for Mandela's recovery and return home.[9] disappearance He passed away on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95. Awards  Nehru Peace Award In recognition of his services to world peace, Mandela was awarded the ""Nehru Peace Award"" by the Government of India while he was in prison. Vinnie came to Delhi on behalf of her husband and received the award. Bharat Ratna Award In 1990 he was also awarded the 'Bharat Ratna' award of India. Nelson Mandela is the only non-Indian to have been awarded the Bharat Ratna.[10] Nobel Prize He was also awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. Nelson Mandela has been awarded the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation.[11] International Nelson Mandela Day The United Nations has declared 18 July, the birthday of South African leader Nelson Mandela, as International Nelson Mandela Day.[12] Statue in Parliament Square, England In front of fans, politicians and thousands of celebrities, a bronze statue of Nelson Mandela was placed next to Sir Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln in Parliament Square, England on 30 August 2007. In a speech to that effect, Nelson Mandela said that the dream he had in 1962 that there would be a statue of a black man in Parliament Square had come true.[13] Nelson Mandela, who dedicated his life to the struggle against apartheid policies, was honored by many countries of the world with the highest awards. It is noteworthy that Mandela has received more than 250 awards in that category.[14] Gallery  ~1937 Jail complex The prison that was Prisoner no 1992 1993 The place where the nation's president Anna later addressed after coming out of prison  See also these  Nelson Mandela International Day Quotations  External links    Category:African Leaders Category:South African politicians Category:Fighters of Charity Category:Bharat Ratna Awardees Category:1918 Births Category:Gandyanists Category:2013 Deaths Category:Lenin Peace Laureates ",How many years was Nelson Mandela in prison?,27,494
"The FIFA World Cup is a global competition between the men's national football teams of different countries that are members of the confederation of international football clubs. The winning team will be awarded the Football World Cup trophy. This competition has been held every four years since 1930 till date. However, due to World War II, the tournament was not held in 1942 and 1946. Cherumani won the tournament in 2014. Teams from 32 countries along with the host country participate in the tournament every fourth year. The World Cup football tournament is designed in such a way that the matches are played between the selected countries and finally one team is declared as the winner. These matches are called World Cup Finals. Teams from countries that are members of the Confederation of International Football Associations, including the host country, compete in qualifying matches in the three years preceding the year of the tournament to determine the teams for the final. Out of the 19 World Cups held so far, teams from eight different countries have won. Brazil have won five times and are the only team to have played in all the tournaments held. Other countries that have won the tournament are Germany and Italy four times, Argentina and Uruguay twice and England, France and Spain once. Football World Cup is the most watched sporting event. A reported 715.1 million viewers watched the 2006 football final in Chermany. . The next World Cup matches will be held in Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022 respectively. History Early International Competitions:- The world's first international football match was played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England. As a result, the match ended in a draw. England's local Champions Cup international competition was held in 1884. During the twentieth century, soccer competitions grew in popularity in other parts of the world. At the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics and the intervening 1906 Games, football was only an exhibition competition with no medals awarded. After the establishment of the Confederation of International Football Clubs in 1904, in 1906 the Confederation attempted to organize an international football competition between countries outside the Olympic structure in Switzerland. In the very early days of international football, the official history of the confederation describes the competition as a failure. M Football was an official competition at the London 1908 Summer Olympics organized by the Football Association of England. Played only by practice players, the match was undoubtedly an exhibition rather than a competition. Great Britain's England National Volunteer Football Team, who won gold medals, also achieved a record by winning the tournament in 1912 in Stockholm. Sir Thomas Lipton organized the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy in 1909, when only volunteer teams continued to compete in Olympic events. Private teams from various countries competed on behalf of their respective countries in the Lipton competition. The tournament is considered to be the equivalent of the first World Cup tournament. The English Football Association refused to send the country's professional team to the tournament, which also featured the most prestigious professional sports teams from countries such as Italy, Germany and Switzerland. Lipton invited the West Auckland professional sports team from the Durham region to represent England instead of England. West Auckland won the tournament and successfully retained it again in 1911. In 1914, the Federation of International Football Associations agreed to recognize the voluntary Olympic football matches as a ""world football tournament"". This agreement led to the 1920 Summer Olympics, the world's first intercontinental football tournament, which was won by Egypt and thirteen European teams. Uruguay won the first two World Cups in 1924 and 1928, marking the beginning of the era of professional association football. World Cups before World War II Jules Rimet, president of the Confederation of International Football Associations, took the success of the Olympic football matches as a driving force and again started organizing the organization's own international football competitions outside the Olympic system. On 8 May 1928, the Confederation of International Football Associations met in Amsterdam. Uruguay, the two-time official soccer world champion, announced that the country will host the World Cup to celebrate the country's 1930 centenary of independence. National confederations of selected countries are invited to send a team for the competition. But Uruguay was chosen as the host country. The selection of Uruguay meant a long and expensive journey across the Atlantic to European countries. As a result, no European country has committed to sending its national team until two months before the tournament. In the end Raimet invited teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to Uruguay. He insisted to play. In the end, a total of thirteen countries participated in the competition, seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America. The first two World Cups were held simultaneously on 13 July 1930. France beat Mexico 4-1 and USA beat Belgium 3-0. The first goal in World Cup football history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France. Uruguay beat Argentina 4-2 in the final in front of a crowd of 93,000 in Montevideo to become the first nation to win the World Cup. Soccer was not included in the schedule of the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles after the World Cup was created due to low interest in the sport among the American public. The International Olympic Association and the Confederation of Football Associations banned non-professional football players from the Summer Olympics that year. Football was reintroduced to the 1936 Summer Olympics. Because of the prestigious World Cup football matches, the Olympic football matches are not generally given much importance. Issues like intercontinental travel and war were the problems faced by World Cup tournaments in the early days. Only a few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 and 1938 tournaments. Brazil was the only South American team to participate in both tournaments. The 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were to be hosted by Germany and Brazil, were canceled due to World War II. World Cup competitions after World War II England withdrew from the Confederation of International Football in 1920, unwilling to play against countries involved in the Second World War and protesting foreign influence in football. But accepted the invitation of the federation and rejoined the federation in 1946. England nationals were first included in the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. The Uruguayan team, which had boycotted the previous two World Cups, was also seen in the match. 1930 World Cup winners Uruguay won the title again defeating hosts Brazil 2-1 in the final in 1950. Brazil's defeat has been described as the fall of Madagascar. 600px|center|Map of countries' best results From 1934 to 1978, 16 teams participated in the tournament each time. But in 1938, Austria did not participate in the tournament as it was annexed by Germany despite qualifying for the tournament. India, Scotland and Turkey withdrew from the 1950 tournament, leaving only 13 countries participating. Majority of the teams from Europe and North America participated in this competition while North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania countries participated as a minority. These minority teams were usually easily defeated by European and South American teams. The United States advanced to the semi-finals in 1930, Cuba to the quarter-finals in 1938, Korea to the quarter-finals in 1966, and Mexico to the quarter-finals in 1970. Expansion to 32 teams The number of teams playing in the World Cup was expanded to 24 in 1982. In 1998 this number was increased to 32 teams. This allowed more countries like Africa, Asia, North America to participate. Participating teams from these countries began to earn modest victories. Mexico, Cameroon, Senegal and the United States and Ghana advanced to the quarter-finals in 1986, 1990, 2002 and 2010 respectively. However, the dominance of European and South American teams continued.For example, in 1994, 1998 and 2006, all the teams that qualified for the quarter-finals were from Europe or South America. It is noteworthy that 200 teams participated in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, 198 teams participated in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and 204 teams participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Other competitions of the federation The first Women's World Cup equivalent to the men's football competition was held in the People's Republic of China in 1991. Although the number of teams participating in the women's tournament was limited, in 2007 the number grew to 120 teams. This growth is more than double that of the 1991 participating teams. Football has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. Despite its place in the Olympics, football matches are not considered as high-level competition as other sports. Since 1992, three players in each team have been allowed to compete in under-23 matches with an age exemption. Women's football was introduced to the Olympic Games in 1996. The competitions were held as a competition between complete national teams with no age restriction. Cup  From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Cup was awarded to the winning team in the final of the Football World Cup. In the early days, the trophy was simply called the World Cup. In 1946, it was decided to name the trophy after Jules Rimet, the FIFA president who first planned and initiated such a tournament. After Brazil won the World Cup for the third time in 1970, the Jules Rimet trophy was given to the team permanently. However, in 1983, Akkobi was stolen; After that, Akopi was never found.[1] After 1970, a trophy called the Victory Cup was designed for the FIFA World Cup. FIFA experts selected from seven countries tested 53 models for the World Cup and eventually chose the model by Italian designer Silvio Cassanica. 36.5 cm. The height of this cup is 5 kg. Made of 18 carat (75%) gold by weight; A total of 6.175 kg including the two-foot malachite base. has weight. The base of the trophy bears the name of the winning team and the year of winning the World Cup.[2] This new trophy is not awarded permanently to the winner. Until the next World Cup tournament, it is held by the last winning team for four years. Later, a gold-plated copy of the trophy was issued.[3] Currently, all members of the team (players, coaches, managers) who finish in the top three places receive medals with the World Cup emblem: gold (manager), silver (second place) and bronze (third place). Medals were also awarded to South Korea's fourth-placed team in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Until 1978, medals were awarded to only 11 players from each team on the field at the end of the final and the third-place match. A decision by FIFA in November 2007 decided that medals would be awarded to all members of the top three teams from 1930 to 1974.[4][5][6] Results   KNP: After extra time Q: After the equalizer Notes  Notes  * ",Which team won the first World Cup football tournament?,Uruguay,1455
"Paris or Bari is the capital city of France. Named the most beautiful city in the world, Paris is also the largest city in the country. The city is divided into two parts by the river Seine. The right bank is in the north and the smaller left bank is in the south. The river is known for its tree-lined walkways (quais), open-air bookstores, and historically important bridges connecting the right and left banks of the river. Paris is also famous for its tree-lined ""boulevards"" such as the Champs-Élysées and many architecturally significant buildings. The city has a population of approximately 20 lakhs (1999 census: 2,147,857). About 1.1 million people (1999 census: 11,174,743) live in the metropolitan area of ​​Paris, known in French as aire urbaine de Paris. History (See History of Paris article for full details) The name Paris derives from the word Parisis, the name of the ""Galic"" ethnic group that lived there during the Roman occupation of the area. Historically the center of Paris is a small island called Île de la Cité, dominated by the Palais de Justice and Notre-Dame de Paris. It is often associated with another island, Île Saint-Louis, which has beautiful houses built in the 17th and 18th centuries. Until the arrival of Rome in 52 BC, the Gallic people lived in Paris. The Romans called them Parisi, although they derived the city's name from Lutecia, which means ""swampy place"". About 50 years later, the city expanded to the left bank of the Seine in what is now the Latin Quarter, which was later renamed ""Paris"". Roman rule ended in 508. Frank Clovius made Paris the capital of the Merovingian dynasty of the Franks. Viking invasions in the 88s forced the Parisians to build a fortress on the Ile de la Cité. On March 28, 845, Paris succumbed to Viking raids believed to be led by Ragnar Lodbrog, but he left Paris with a large sum of money. As the power of the later Carolingian kings declined, the Counts of Paris gradually gained in power. As a result, Odo, Count of Paris, was recognized as King of France by the landed gentry, although Charles III also claimed the throne. Finally, after the death of the last Carolingian in 987, Hugh Cuppet, Count of Paris, was chosen as king. In the 11th century the city expanded to the right bank of the river. The city flourished during the 12th and 13th centuries, which included the reign of Philip II Augustus (1180–1223). Located along major thoroughfares, the first Louvre was built as a fortress, and many churches were built or begun, including Notre Dame. Several academies on the Right Bank were organized into the Sorbonne. Albertus Magnus, sen. Thomas Aquinas was an early scholar of these. Apart from a temporary interruption caused by the Black Death in the 14th century, Paris was a center of commerce and knowledge during the Middle Ages. During the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715), known as the Sun King, the royal residences were moved from Paris to nearby Versailles. Geography Paris consists of two islands, Saint Louis and de la Cité, on the northern bend of the Seine River. De la Cité is the oldest part of Paris. The city is comparatively level. The lowest elevation is 35 meters (115 feet) above sea level. Paris has many hills. The tallest of these is Montmartre at 130 meters (427 ft). Paris covers an area of ​​86,928 square kilometers (34 sq mi), excluding the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes parks on the outskirts of the city. Finally in 1860 it annexed the city and its outlying areas, giving the city its present shape. From 78 square kilometers in 1860, the city area increased slightly to 86.9 square kilometers in 1920. In 1929 the forest parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes were annexed to the city. This makes the total area of ​​Paris 105,397 square meters (41 square miles). Climate Paris has an oceanic climate. It is influenced by North Atlantic currents. Due to this, it is rare to see extreme high temperature or extreme low temperature in the city. Average summer temperatures are a high of 25 °C (77 °F) and a low of 15 °C (59 °F). Even though it is very cold in winter, the temperature does not go below freezing. Average temperatures range from 3 °C (37 °F) – 8 °C (46 °F). Summers and autumns are mild during the day and cool at night. Rainy muggles can be found here at any time of the year. Although Paris is not the rainiest city, it is known for its rainfall. Rainfall is 650 mm (26 in) per year. But moderate rainfall is widespread throughout the year. It doesn't often snow in Paris. There is light snow in some seasons. The highest temperature ever recorded in Paris was 40.4 °C (105 °F). It was registered on 28 July 1948. The lowest temperature was −23.9 °C (−11 °F). It was registered on 10th December 1879. Temperatures are moderate at night and in the morning due to the urban heat effect in the center of the city. It also gets less snow than the outskirts of the city. Urban look  Architecture Contemporary Paris is largely the result of massive urban renewal projects that took place in the mid-19th century. For centuries Paris was a city of cramped streets and half-timbered houses. But beginning in 1852, many of the old buildings were torn down and the roads widened by the urbanization plans of Lord Osman, and new buildings in the stone style were erected on both sides. Most of the old buildings still standing today are from this period. Since the ""alignment"" rules defined at the time are still used by the city of Paris today in many new building works, it is likely that these Second Empire plans are still in use today in many places. Heights of buildings are also determined even today based on road widths defined then. Also, few amendments have been made to building codes since the 19th century to accommodate tall buildings.  The immutable boundaries of Paris, strict building regulations, and the scarcity of land for new buildings have created a phenomenon known as museumification. Efforts to preserve Paris' history have also made it difficult to build new large buildings and other service-providing structures to accommodate the growing population within the city limits. Many of Paris' companies and economic structures are already located in the suburbs or plan to relocate. The financial and commercial sector, an important food wholesale market, several important renowned schools, world-renowned research institutes, the largest sports stadium, and some ministries such as the Ministry of Transport are located outside of Paris. The National Archives of France has a pre-2010 location for the northern suburbs. The French government has accepted the need to expand Paris. Although discussions took place in November 2007, no decision was made on which areas would be annexed to Paris.

"The Three Gorges Dam is a hydroelectric dam built across the Yangtze River. This dam is located near Sandouping City, Yiling District, Hubei Province, China. It is the largest power generating station in the world[1]. The dam structure was completed in 2006. By the time the 26th shore-based generator became commercially operational on October 30, 2008, all areas specified in the original plan had been completed except for the ship lift area. Each generator has a capacity of 700 MW. The six underground generators will not be fully operational before 2012. Including the dam's 32 primary generators and two smaller generators of 50 MW capacity, the total power generation capacity of the dam is 22.5 GW. Apart from power generation and flood control, this dam project also enables the passage of large vessels in the river. The Chinese government considers the project a historic engineering, social and economic achievement. However, many archaeological and cultural sites were submerged due to the dam. 1.3 million people were displaced. And thus the situation changed significantly; Chances of landslides also increased [2]. The dam is viewed as controversial by many in China and abroad.[3] Name reason Located on the Yangtze River, the region is known as the Three Gorges Region, which consists of three valleys: Qutang (瞿塘峡)) Gorge, Wu (巫峡) Gorge, and Xiling (西陵峡) Gorge. This dam is known as Three Valleys Dam because of its location in this area. This dam is the third of these three gorges and is located in the longest Xiling (西陵峡) gorge. Project history  In 1919, Sun Yat-sen in his book ""Strategy for States-Part II: Industrial Projects"" (Strategy for State) recommended the construction of a dam here for shipping in the region and to utilize the hydropower of the region.[4] He said the dam, located downstream of the Three Gorges region, could generate 30 million (22,371 MW) of hydropower. In 1932, the National Government led by Chiang Kai-shek undertook the initial phase of damming in the Three Gorges. In 1939, the Japanese army captured Yichang and assessed the area where the dam would be built. In anticipation of Japan's conquest of China, the Japanese designed the Otani Project for the dam. In 1944, John L. Savage, chief design engineer of the United States Bureau of Land Management, evaluated the area and proposed a dam concept called the Yangtze River Project.[5] Following this, 54 Chinese engineers went to the United States for training. While they completed their training in various fields, this work was interrupted in 1947 due to the Chinese Civil War. Ma Tse Tung supported this plan after the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. However, the Gezhouba dam project was taken up first. The project was delayed due to economic problems caused by the Cultural Revolution and the move forward. After the Hundred Flowers Movement in 1958, some engineers who spoke against the scheme were jailed.[6] By the 1980s, the concept of the scheme again received the attention of the rulers. The National People's Congress approved the dam project in 1992. It resumed operations on December 14, 1994. The dam was expected to become fully operational in 2009. But it is not expected to reach full operation before 2012 due to additional construction work, such as six generators placed underground. In 2008, the dam raised the water level to 172.5 meters (566 ft).[7]   Basement The wall of the dam is made of pine. The length of the wall is 2,309 meters (7,575 ft) and the height is 185 meters (607 ft). The wall is 115 meters (377 ft) thick at the bottom of the dam and 40 meters (131.2 ft) thick at the top. The project used 27,200,000 cubic meters (35,600,000 cubic feet) of concrete and 463,000 tons of iron, enough to build 63 Eiffel Towers, and 102,600,000 cubic meters (134,200,000 cubic feet) of excavated soil.[8] The barge has its own waterway on the right side of the lift dam. The reservoir created by the dam is on average 660 km (410 mi) long and 1.12 km (0.70 mi) wide when the dam's water level is 175 m (574 ft) above sea level (110 m or 361 ft above the downstream river level). Economic components The project is expected to cost 180 billion yuan when completed, which is 12% less than what was originally expected to cost. This is due to lower inflation, not lower spending.[9] At the end of 2008, expenditure was 148.365 billion yuan, of which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557 billion yuan on resettlement of affected people, and 15.195 billion yuan on financing and loans.[10] The amount spent on the construction of the dam is expected to be recouped when the dam generates 1,000 TWh of electricity worth 250 billion yuan. The entire amount spent on the project is expected to be recouped within ten years of the dam being fully operational.[11] Funding for the project comes from the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign businesses, corporate bonds, and earnings before and after the dam is fully operational.[12]  Power generation and distribution The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Its total capacity is 22,500 MW. It has 34 actuators. 32 are of 700 MW capacity and two are of 50 MW capacity. Out of these 32, 14 are on the north side of the dam and 12 are on the south side. The remaining rivers are located in the foothills in the southern part. The amount of electricity generated from this is expected to be more than 100 TWh per annum. On October 26, 2010, the dam's water level was raised to a record high of 175m and the dam's power generation was at full capacity.[13] First started power generation in July 2003. In July 2012, 9 years after the dam began generating electricity, all 32 generators were commissioned and the full capacity (22.5 GW) of electricity was drawn, accounting for 11% of China's total hydropower generation.[14] Electrons  The primary generators weigh 6,000 tons each and are designed to generate 700 MW of electricity. The level of the generators is designed to be 80.6 meters (264 feet). The volume of water passing through the generators is 600–950 cubic meters (780–1,240 cu yd), depending on its level. If the level is large then less water is needed to produce more energy. Here Francis turbine is used. Diameter of turbine is 9.7/10.4 meters; The rotation speed is 75 per minute. The outer diameter of the electric suspension is 21.4/20.9 meters and the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8 meters. Its height is 3.1/3 meters. This is the largest of these types of electronic stops. These alternators are manufactured by two joint ventures. Environmental effects Biodiversity There are thought to be only 3,000 - 4,000 endangered Siberian storks left in the world. Many of them stay in the mangroves of the region during the winter. Dam construction destroyed those lands. The dam is also partly responsible for the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin, Baiji. Power generation According to the China National Development and Reform Organization, 366 grams of coal produces 1 kWh of electricity in China. The dam will reduce coal consumption by 31 million tonnes per year when operating at full capacity. It also reduces 100 million tons of greenhouse gases, millions of dust, millions of tons of sulfur dioxide, 370,000 tons of nitric oxide, 10,000 tons of carbon monoxide and significantly less mercury. As a result, the amount of coal mined and cleaned for electricity in North China is reduced. Soil erosion, sedimentation Soil erosion and sedimentation are two factors affecting this dam. At present 80% of the land area is subject to soil erosion. As a result, 40 million tons of sediment is deposited in the Yangtze River every year. Deforestation caused by people resettled for dam construction, agricultural needs are thought to create soil erosion. By controlling the periodic and unregulated flooding of the Yangtze River by the dam, riverbank erosion in the lower reaches of the river will be reduced. The dam will reduce the amount of sediment entering the Yangtze River estuary, and the deposited sediment will reduce the dam's power generation capacity. Sediment depletion in the lower reaches of the river may cause erosion and subsidence of the coastal areas of the river. It is also thought that excessive sedimentation may clog the dam's sluices and cause the dam to fail. Critics say an average of 530 million tons of sediment will end up in the dam's reservoir each year. It is also believed that the mouth of the turbines of the generators will be blocked by the silt that accumulates in the dam. But since 2006 China has been building four large dams upstream of the dam, the amount of sediment entering the dam will be less than originally predicted. A reduction in sediment supply has two effects. Some hydrologists believe that the riverbanks in the lower reaches of the river are more vulnerable to flooding. Over 1000 miles away, the city of Shanghai at the mouth of the Yangtze River lies on a great alluvial plain. The sediments from the river have strengthened the area. Less sediment supply will reduce the strength of the alluvial plain. So they think that the cities like Shanghai built on top of it will be affected. Earthquake and Landslide The dam is located in an earthquake prone area. The combination of seismicity caused by an earthquake and the weight of water stored in the dam can cause the top of the dam to break.[15] Erosion caused by rising water levels often results in large-scale landslides. Two landslides in May 2009 released 50,000 and 20,000 cubic meters (65,000 and 26,000 cubic yards) of mud into the river, respectively.[16] Waste Management The dam also improved the wastewater treatment plant in Chongqing and its suburbs upstream. As of April 2007, more than 50 sewage treatment plants were set up, treating 1.84 million tons of waste per day, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection. This is 65% of the city's demand. Also, 32 new dumping sites were established where 7,664.5 tonnes of solid waste was collected per day. More than a million tonnes of sewage is released into the river every year. Forests Currently 10% forest cover is in the Three Valleys region, compared to 20% forest cover in 1950. Research by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization suggests that in 2008 the Asia-Pacific region gained 6,000 square km of forest cover. This is a significant change compared to the loss of 13,000 sq km of forest per year in the 1990s. The primary reason for this is China's efforts in afforestation. After the worst floods in 1998, the Chinese government began reforestation of the Yangtze River basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam, which was attributed to deforestation. Flood control and agriculture Flood control is the primary function of the dam. Flooding is a major problem of the Yangtze River. Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with major cities such as Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai lining the river. A lot of farmland and China's specialized factories are located along the river. The reservoir capacity of the dam is 22 cubic km (18 million acre feet). Because of this capacity, the amount of flooding downstream of the river is limited once every ten or hundred years. This dam is expected to greatly reduce the impact of major floods. The Yangtze River floods of 1954 killed 33,169 people and displaced 18,884,000. Wuhan, a city of eight million people, was under water for three months. The Jingguang train service has been out of service for 100 days. It is known that 50 billion cubic meters of water came in the flood of 1954. A 1998 flood in the region caused billions of dollars worth of damage, submerging 2,039 square km (787 sq mi) of farmland. 2.3 million people were affected and 1,526 people died. It is considered the worst flood in North China in 40 years. The flood in August 2009 broke through the dam, reducing the severity of the flood and releasing 40,000 cubic meters of water per second. Thus the water level of the dam rose from 145.13 meters on August 1, 2009 to 152.88 meters on August 8, 2009. 4.27 billion cubic meters of flood water was held back by the dam. Also the water discharge was reduced to 15,000 cubic meters per second, saving the lower reaches of the river from the risk of flooding. The water in the dam is released from November to April during the dry season. Due to this, the water flow in the lower reaches of the river increases and during those times, water is available for agriculture and industries without interruption. And due to this, the environment for ships in the river also improves during this period. During this period the water level of the dam decreases from 175 meters to 145 meters. This low water level helps to cope with the coming monsoon season and flash floods. Since 2003, 11 billion cubic meters of water has been released into the river during droughts from this dam. This alleviated the drought and benefited the arable lands and cities in the lower reaches of the river. The July 2010 flood had an inflow of 70,000 cubic meters per second into the dam. Due to this the water level of the dam rose by four meters overnight. 40,000 cubic meters of water was released from the dam. Due to this dam, the lower reaches of the river have been saved from heavy floods [17]. Quotations  external link    - Project information page BBC - - September 14, 2004.

"A clock (dial) (clock, timer, bell) is an instrument used to show, measure, and coordinate time. A clock is also referred to as a clock. A wristwatch is called a wristwatch. Usually the watch is not designed to be easily carried. The system of measuring time was invented by man as a stage of civilization maturity. One of the oldest human inventions, it is usually used to measure shorter periods of time than the natural measurement of a day. Clocks that have been in use for centuries have seen many developments in physical processes. Sundial and other instruments A sundial indicates a clock that measures time based on the light of the sun and the movement of the resulting shadows. The Sumerians are thought to have been pioneers in trying to measure time since prehistoric times. It is said that the Sumerian civilization was the first to divide a year into months, a month into days, and a day into several components. Over time the Arabs made attempts to measure time using their own methods. And the Egyptians measured time by setting up 24 great poles in circular orbits following the movement of the sun and the light and shadow falling on them. Efforts to measure time continuously have been made in many countries through different civilizations. Since the light of the sun is not available at night, they keep a steady burning wick and count the time at night. They measured the time by pouring sand into a small hole (hourglass). Water clocks  At the same time, an experimental attempt was made to measure time using water in Greece. In this device, the water is arranged so that each drop falls into a stone vessel. Time was measured based on the amount of water accumulated. Such a method in B.C. 320 came out of custom. The Greeks and Romans improved and modified this water clock around 300-400 BC. There is no information about where and when these were first used. Clocks with a simple form of water emerging from a bowl were first used in Babylon and Egypt in BC. Used in the 16th century. Such watches were also in circulation in India and China. Greek astronomer Andronicus B.C. 1 There are references to the construction of a clock tower (Tower of the Winds) in Athens.[1] The Greeks and Romans are said to have been the first to modernize water clocks. Water clocks were designed to automatically keep time with high precision using cogs[2]. These inventions were introduced to Europe by the Byzantine Empire and the Muslims. Individually the Chinese also developed modern water clocks （水鐘） around 725 AD. From there they spread to Korea and Japan. Some water clock designs resulted from knowledge transfer privately and some through business diffusion. Triage clocks were largely used for astrological purposes because the triage did not require the pulsating measurements required during the Industrial Revolution. These were used along with the sundial. Although these water clocks did not reach the level of accuracy of a modern clock, they remained the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping instrument until the pendulum clock came into use in Europe in the 17th century. Islamic civilization is credited with pioneering the precision of detailed engineering clocks. In 797 the Baghdad Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid presented an Asiatic elephant and a highly sophisticated water clock[3] to King Charlemagne. Modern clock Around 1510 AD, Peter Henkin, a German locksmith, created a standing clock that told the time. Then around 1656, the Dutch engineer Huygens succeeded in measuring time by creating a pendulum clock. He divided a day into 24 hours, an hour into 60 minutes and a minute into 60 seconds. He also improved the clock using new methods. All present watches are the advanced forms of this. Initially, all parts of this clock were made of wood. Later these parts were made of metal and glass. A clock made of glass was invented in 1927 AD by Warren Morrison, a technician from the Canadian Department of Telecommunications. It gained popularity in a very short period of time. Until the early nineteenth century, pendulum clocks were widely used. A symmetrically swinging pendulum was used to actuate the two hands of the clock and display the correct time. These types of watches can still be found here and there today. But after the invention of electricity, pendulum clocks changed. Alexander Paine invented a battery powered clock in 1840. Later many scientists improved this type of clock. Smaller batteries were used instead of larger batteries. HMD called Hindustan Machine Tools. The industry is one of the oldest watch factories in India. Before this industry made watches mostly imported watches were used in our country. Currently, many companies like Titan, Timex, Citizen are involved in watch manufacturing in India and are manufacturing watches to world standards. Categories Time screen modes  Analog Synchronous clocks usually have a round clock face, with hands called hands that rotate in line with the numbers marked on it. Around the world, the hand on the round clock face makes two revolutions in a day to indicate the hours between 1 and 12 o'clock. A long minute hand displays the minutes divided into 60 divisions of the occurring hour on the same circular face. A similar second hand rotates to show the seconds of the then occurring minute. The only widely used clock faces today are 24-hour synchronous clocks. A timetable is used. Clocks with different time face designs were also used throughout the year during the Industrial Revolution before modern clocks came into vogue. Time was divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours. During the French Revolution, the French government tried to introduce a 10-hour clock in order to implement the decimal metric measurement system. clock consumes a lot of power)  Another example of a synchronous clock is a sundial or sundial. A sundial is a device that calculates the time of day based on the position of the sun. Typically a horizontal sundial indicator design has the shadow of the sun falling on the lines representing the time marked on it. A gnomon, a time-telling device, is usually a thin wire or a device with a sharp or straight edge. As the Sun moves the shadow of the tip of this system falls on lines representing different times. All sundial indicators must be aligned with the Earth's spin axis to show the correct time. There are different types of sundial indicator. Some sundials use a line of light to show the time. Others use the edges of the shade Digital  Digital clocks A digital clock installed outside the Kanzansawa railway station in Japan to control the artificial fountain stop. Basic digital clock radio The time is displayed digitally in the upper right corner of the smart speaker's screen  Digital or octal clocks display the time in numbers. Generally two octal formats are used in these clocks. A 24-hour code consisting of hours 00-23 12-hour time codes marked morning/afternoon (AM/PM). 1 am to 11 am followed by 12 am, 1 pm to 11 pm followed by 12 pm (notation used in domestic contexts) Most digital clocks operate on electronic mechanisms with displays such as liquid crystal display (LCD), light emitting diode (LED), vacuum fluorescent display (VFD). These clocks display 12:00 o'clock and flash the number 12:00 to set the time. Some newer clocks reset themselves (time) based on radio or Internet time servers. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of synchronous clocks has declined significantly Auditory Time is timed by speaking or sounding to account for distance, telemetry, or visual impairment. The sound can be either natural speech (eg saying the time is 12:30) or auditory cues (a series of chimes, such as a London Big-Ben clock). Most of the telcos are offering the talking clock service.

"Socrates (470/469 BC – 399 BC, February 15) [1] was a philosopher from Athens. No clear evidence is available as to when he was born. He is considered one of the most important icons of the Western philosophical tradition. His disciple Plato [2] was also a famous philosopher. Socrates is hailed as the Greek philosopher and the world's first philosopher. He asked the religious people, ""Who is God?"" His best is that Socrates was the first rationalist to ask the question. Socrates is famous for his contribution to the field of ethics as depicted through Plato's dialogues. Philosopher Socrates is known for his philosophical ideas of Socratic Irony and Socratic Method. The latter concept is commonly used as a tool in broad discussion, which is also a form of pedagogy, in which questions are asked not only to elicit individual responses to a series of questions, but also to encourage basic insight. Plato's Socrates contributed important and stable theories related to the theory of light. And his ideology and approach provided a strong foundation for subsequent Western philosophy. Socrates' conundrum No works of Socrates have been found. Thus information about him and his philosophies rests on secondary sources. Furthermore, a close comparison between the contents of these sources exposes some inconsistencies, thus raising concerns about the possibility of knowing deeper truths about the real Socrates. This doubt is known as Socrates' conundrum [3] or Socrates' question [4][5]. One who wants to understand Socrates and his thoughts must first read Plato's works. These are important sources for the life and philosophy of Socrates[6] as are the works of Xenophon[7]. Among these are reports of frank dialogues involving Socrates[8][9]. Other than the Xenophon, the ancient sources available for discovering facts about Socrates' life are mostly philosophical and dramatic texts. There is no direct contemporary history of Socrates. Two factors emerge from all sources relating to Socrates among all the opinions that have resulted in differences in the available sources. While he may have been ugly, Socrates seems to have had a brilliant intellect [10][11]. Birth and Early Life of Socrates No evidence is available as to when Socrates was born. 2450 years ago i.e. BC. Socrates lived in the fifth century. He was born in the Greek city of Athens. His father was a sculptor. His mother is a midwife. At that time when no religion appeared in the world, he became proficient in the origin of human knowledge and logic through his own efforts. Socrates is hailed as the Greek philosopher and the world's first philosopher. Questioning skills As a boy, Socrates had a habit of asking questions. Socrates' habit was to ask questions about anything and find out the truth about it. Socrates examined everything like justice, reason, soul, God, society, government and custom. Socrates spent a great deal of time meeting people in public and conversing with them. But when others ask Socrates a question, Socrates does not directly answer it. Socrates would ask people question after question, focusing on a particular problem, asking them to answer, and asking the people who raised the problem to understand the reason. Socrates, who through his questioning made us realize the cause of the problem, also asked questions to solve the problem. The public was enlightened by such actions; They understood the problem. They also knew the reason. They also realized what needs to be done to overcome it. As a result, the Athenians believed that Socrates would provide clarity to all their problems. Socrates' writings and speeches made people think; It also motivates them to take action Student of Socrates This questioning style of Socrates impressed the youth of Athens. Among the youth, Socrates was always present. Socrates' lodgings were always surrounded by a crowd of young people. His habit of asking questions was also transmitted to the young people. Not only did Socrates think about all the superstitions that had been practiced in Greek society for ages, but the young people also started to change. Similarly, Plato was inspired by Socrates' principles and joined Socrates. Later in the day, he also became a world famous philosopher.  Blame it on Socrates The government of Athens found out that the young people had started to change. When Socrates was surrounded by a crowd of young people, it annoyed some people. Socrates' daily conversation with the young people angered the Greek rulers. There were serious allegations against him. Socrates was sued by the politician Anytus, the artist Melitus, and the orator Lycon. This was due to their hatred of Socrates. Anidas, Lycaon, and Melitus accused Socrates of inciting the youth, inciting religious opposition, of engaging the youth in wrong ways for his own glory, and thereby endangering the Athenian government. Death Penalty After countless allegations, the case came to trial in the court. Then Melidus accused Socrates. He corrupts the youth, blasphemes the gods the Greeks worshiped, creates a new god of his own, explores the heavens and the earth (because the Greeks at that time worshiped nature as their god). He says that the moon is soil and the sun is stone. Introduces new religious doctrines. Socrates is very evil. He said that he should be sentenced to death. Socrates replied, 'I don't want to put my opponents in court and cross-examine them. My just enemies are injustice and ignorance. I refuse to acknowledge that I am lord of stone and earth. If researching about God and His creation is atheism, fearing where they will refuse to acknowledge God is more atheism than that. After this came the moment of judgment in the court. Two boxes were kept, Death and Forgiveness. 501 members of the Judiciary begin voting. 220 voted to pardon Socrates and 281 voted to sentence him to death. The judges declared Socrates guilty and ordered Socrates to declare what punishment he should be given. that he has not committed any crime; Socrates argued that his mother had done good for the country by her actions, and for that the court should have awarded her praise and reward instead of punishment. But if this Court decides to impose a penalty, it should be a fine; Socrates declared in court that his friends were ready to pay the fine to the government. The judges expected Socrates to apologize for his actions. But instead his arguments in court irritated the judges. So that Socrates should be poisoned and killed in BC. The judges ordered on 15th February 339. Death The court ruled that the sentence would be executed after 30 days due to some reasons, and until then, Socrates' legs should be chained. Then the day of execution came. Socrates, who bought the poisoned cup, said, ""What should I do next?"" said. He said, “You must drink the poison in the cup. You should be walking around the prison after drinking. ""You should lie down when your legs are weak,"" said the jailer. Socrates finished drinking a cup of poison with a smile on his face. Seeing it, all the friends burst into tears.  ""Why do you shed tears like women?"" Socrates asked with a smile and started walking. After walking for a while, he lay down on the ground. The poisoner squeezed Socrates' legs and said, ""Do you see me squeezing your legs?"" He said. ""No"" said Socrates. After a while his eyes closed. Socrates' method His method of philosophical inquiry, known as the Socratic method or the Elenchos method, is his most important contribution to Western thought. He often used this method to test (examine) important points of virtue. For this, Socrates is regarded as the father and fountainhead of Virtue or Virtue Philosophy and thus of general philosophy.

"The basic unit of time is the second or second, as determined by the International System of Units (SI). Its symbol and abbreviation are as follows: Code: (English: s; Tamil: व or विणात or संद) Abbreviation Code: (Abbreviation Code: English: s; Tamil: व).[1][2] Minutes are obtained when the hour is first divided into sixty divisions. Second division of the hour into sixty divisions gives seconds or seconds. The second division is called 'Second' in English.[3] Cesium (atomic mass: 133) has a period of 9 192 631 770 periods of radiation when it transitions between two microscopic levels in atomic physics. This is called the second or second in the SI unit.[1][4] A second (or second) is the basic unit used to measure time.[5] 60 seconds = 1 minute (hour).[6] Definition History Early Civilizations: Early civilizations divided the day into smaller divisions and gave separate names to the elements. But no one has formally used the word second or second for the fraction of a given time. BC In 2000 the Egyptians divided a day equally into twelve hours of day and twelve hours of night. Hence the degree of length of hours in days and nights also differed according to seasonal variations. The Hellenistic astronomers Hipparchus (c. 150 BC) and Ptolemy (c. 150) divided the hour into sixty parts (the number system under sexagesimal fractions). They used a mean hour (1/24 day), simple fractions of an hour (1/4, 2/3, etc.), and a time angle (1/360 day, or the equivalent of four modern minutes).[7] ] BC After 300 AD the Babylonians calculated a day using the following system of fractions of sixty. Each subsequent subsection is divided by sixty. That is, 1/60, 1/60, 1/60 is calculated as a power of sixty. Its accuracy is equal to 2 microseconds.[8] The Babylonians did not use hours. But a double duration of 120 modern minutes was used. A duration—estimated at four long minutes. A barleycorn lasts 3 1/3 modern seconds (modern Hebrew's calendar arc),[9] but is not subdivided into smaller units under the fractions of sixty. Based on subdivisions of lunar cycle:  Circa 1000, the Persian scholar al-Biruni used the Arabic term for second or second. He divides the time between the two avayadhas into weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and third and fourth afternoon Sundays.[10]  In 1267, the medieval scientist Roger Bacon, in a Latin account, divided between the third and fourth full moons into hours (horae-horae), minutes (minuta-minuta), seconds (secunda-secunda), thirds (tertia-tertia). and defined the fourth (quarta-quarta) in a specific calendar.[11] Modern seconds or seconds are divided using decimal numbers as follows - the third code word (1⁄60th of a second) Other languages ​​also use the word seconds or seconds. Example: Polish (turcja-tercja) and Turkish (salise-salise). Based on mechanical clocks:  By the end of the 16th century, the earliest clocks used to show seconds appeared. After the invention of mechanical clocks it became easy to measure seconds or seconds accurately. This is against the intended time shown by the sundial. In the Fremersdorf collection, a clock depicting Orpheus, a push clock with a second hand with a spiral bow, attracted the most attention. It started in 1560 and finished in the third quarter of the 16th century when Taqi al-Din built a clock that showed every 1/5 minute.[12] In 1579, Jost Bürgi made a clock showing seconds for William of Hesse.[13]:105}} In 1581, Tycho Braghi made a restored clock. He used it in his astronomical observatories. They showed minutes and seconds. However, they are not accurate enough to predict seconds. In 1587, Tycho complained that his four clocks differed by four seconds more or less.seconds.[13]:104 In 1644, Marin Mersenne measured seconds using a pendulum 39.1 inches long (0.994). It worked with projected gravitational acceleration. He accurately calculated that the pendulum would take one second to move forward and one second to move backward.[14] In 1670, London clockmaker William Clement combined this second pendulum with Christian Icon's original pendulum clock.[15] From 1670 to 1680, Clement made several improvements to his clocks. In 1832, Carl Friedrich Gauss proposed the second as the basic unit of time in his millimeter-milligram-second standardized system of units. In 1862, the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) agreed that ""on scientific grounds, all calendars should use the second, the mean base unit of solar time"".[16] On the basis of part of a year:  NPTs were described in Newcomb's Solar Motion Chart (1895), based on Earth's motion. Based on astronomical observations between 1750 and 1892, a formula for estimating the value of the sun's motion was developed.[17] In particular, the tables used for most of the 20th century were based on Newcomb's solar movement. (1900 to 1983). Also, Ernest William Brown's lunar tables were used from 1923 to 1983. Based on the cesium microwave atomic clock:  After several years of work, Teddington, England, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory, and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Astronomical Station confirmed the relationship between the Me transition frequency of the cesium atom and the planetary period.[18] In this, W. W. V. (WWV) used a common visual measurement method based on signals received from a radio station.[19] They found and confirmed that the astronomical period (ET), second or second, the frequency of the chosen cesium atom had the same magnitude of 9,192,631,770 ± 20 cycles.[18]  (The SI second was already adopted. The SI second was slightly shorter than the second value of the mean solar period.[20][21]) Relativistically, the SI second value is defined as the exact time of Earth's motion and rotation.[22] Based on the proposed optical atomic clock: Quote by Ludlow et al: Optical atomic clocks pose a challenge to atomic clocks operating in the microwave region today.[23] The National Research Council of Canada indicates that 2.5 × 10-11 is ""relatively uncertain"". Instead of an atomic clock based on an iodine (atomic weight 127) molecule, he advocated the use of a strontium (atomic weight 88) ion trap.[24] Uncertainties rival the NIST-F1 cesium atomic clock in the microwave region, which is estimated to average sixteen parts of a day to the power of ten in terms of frequency.[25][26] A second is defined as follows according to the exact position. A second is defined in terms of micro-energy differences caused by the magnetic field in the nucleus of a cesium-133 atom when it is in its ground state. A second is the duration of 192 631 770 oscillations between two very fine energy gaps in the ground state of a cesium-133 atom at a stationary temperature of 0 K (Kelvin). There are 3600 seconds in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So one second is equal to 24 seconds.

"The ocean is an important salt water body. It is an important component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of Earth's surface (361 million square kilometers) is covered by continuous oceans. It is divided into many oceans and many small seas. About 71% of the Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere are oceans. [1] Oceans make up 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers report that less than 5% of the world's oceans have been explored. [1] The Earth's oceans contain about 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu in) of water,[2][3][4] with an average depth of about 3,700 meters (12,100 ft). More than half of its surface is more than 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep. The average salinity is 35 parts per thousand (35%). Generally, whole seawater has an average salinity of 30 - 38 parts per thousand. Because the world's oceans are an important part of the Earth's biosphere, it affects areas of the carbon cycle, climate, and weather across all time periods. There are 230,000 known species of life in the world's oceans, but as most are undiscovered, more than twenty million are thought to exist. [5] The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown; The formation of oceans during the Hadean period may have been the impetus for the emergence of life. Although there is evidence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System, the only confirmed oceans outside of Earth are the Great Lakes of Titan on Saturn's moon Titan. According to geological histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large oceans of water in the beginning. The Martian ocean hypothesis suggests that about one-third of the Martian surface was covered by water, possibly evaporated by the greenhouse effect on Venus. Many dwarf planets and moons are speculated to have unconsolidated oceans on their surfaces; Notably, the oceans of Europa, a satellite of Jupiter, are estimated to contain twice the amount of water on Earth. The major planets in the Solar System contain elements to confirm that liquid atmospheric layers may still exist today. Oceanic planets are a hypothetical type of planet whose entire surface is covered with liquid. [6][7] genesis The word ""ocean"" in English derives from the Greek mythology, Oseus (/oʊsiːənəs/; Greek: Ὠκεανός Ōkeanós, [8] pronounced [ɔːkeanós]), in Greek mythology, was Titan's brother, the personification of the great river that encircled the world, the ancient Greeks and Romans. The sea was believed to be divine by civilized people. Scholars believe that the concept of ossius is related to the Indo-European concept. [9] Earth's global ocean Sea areas Although the Earth's surface oceans are generally considered separate, they are all connected to one another as the global ocean of salty water. Thus all the oceans have free exchanges with each other and is called a single world ocean or world ocean. [10][11] The major oceanic divisions are listed in descending order, partly by continents, island groups, and other orders of magnitude, with various fossils, and other criteria. [12][7][13]  Sources: Encyclopedia of Geography, [21][14][15][16][20] International Hydrographic Organization,[22] Regional Maritimes: An Introduction (Tomczak, 2005), [18] Encyclopedia Britannica [19] International Telecommunication Union. [23]|style=line-height: 1.4em; margin: 1em 0 1.4em 1em; font-size: 0.9em;}}   The Pacific and Atlantic oceans are also divided into north and south regions by the geocentric line. Small parts of oceans are called seas, gulfs, gulfs etc. There are also some saline water bodies that are surrounded by land. Aral Sea, Great Salt Lake are some of these. Although they are called oceans, they are actually saltwater lakes. Great ocean  The largest ocean in the world is the Pacific Ocean. It covers one-third of the world's land area. The Pacific Ocean is the deepest ocean in the world. It is thirty-six thousand two hundred feet deep.  A very small ocean The world's smallest ocean is the Arctic Ocean. It is also called the Northern Ocean.   The color of the ocean Generally people say that water reflects the blue sky and therefore is blue, but that is not true. The color varies depending on the volume and depth of the sea water. These color changes are usually seen in the oceans. Often the ocean is green and blue in color. This color variation is due to ocean water absorbing the red color of sunlight and emitting blue and green colors. Biology The ocean plays a significant role in the life of living beings. Ocean vapor is a phase of the water cycle and the primary source of precipitation, and ocean temperatures determine climate and wind patterns that affect life on land. Life in the oceans originated about 3 billion years ago. Both depth and distance from the coast strongly influence the biodiversity of plants and animals in each region. [24] Organisms that live in oceans can also live in salt water. Various marine organisms live in shallow water, and in the deep sea. Almost all animals live directly or indirectly in the ocean. Sea crabs can be found in shallow water. Dolphins, whales, etc. are more common in the ocean. And many types of mammals are among the marine life. Ocean environment Like the ocean, the environment of the ocean is also there. There are many volcanoes in the ocean. Also, higher peaks than Everest are located in the ocean. Also corals and minerals are buried in the ocean. Salt in the ocean Oceans contain salt water. Seawater is salty because salt minerals move from the land to the sea via rivers. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere mixes with rainwater and becomes slightly acidic, then mountain water turns into rivers, mixes with various minerals such as salt in mountain rocks and soil, and finally mixes with the sea, making sea water too salty to drink. Also, undersea volcanoes spewing steam, volcanic eruptions, and salt minerals in the subsurface mix with the ocean, causing seawater to become salty.[25] Harvest at sea Countries like Russia and Japan are making a lot of profit from the ocean. Russian and Japanese fishermen go on huge ships and go to catch fish in the ocean for many years. In those ships, they and their families have all the facilities. Hospital, factories, schools, food and many other places are on the ship. Fishing industry Oceanographers estimate that there are 15,300 species of fish in the ocean. It is said that they are mostly used for food. Fish is a food rich in protein. Fishing industries provide food and employment to millions of people. Today, marine fish provide about 2% of the calories needed by coastal populations, usually through sea fishing. Tuna, anchovies, and pollock, flounder, and flounder are surface-caught fish. One million tons of marine fish are caught each year in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Nearly eight out of ten fish caught are eaten by humans. Other fish are used as fertilizer, glue, and food for other animals. Ocean heat Temperature varies in the ocean. There are two types of heat transfer, vertical (top to bottom) and horizontal. At the equator the ocean is warm, while at the tip(s) it is much colder water and glaciers. Water heats and cools more slowly than land. So the climate of the ocean is different from that of the land. And the heat of the sea changes in three ways at the same place. That means one heat is felt at the surface, one heat above 2000 feet, and one heat at the bottom. These are called thermally mixed layers. The bottom of the ocean is black without light because the salts in the sea water scatter the light.

"Portugal (Portuguese: Portugal), also known as the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese Republic, Portuguese: República Portuguesa), is a country in the Iberian Peninsula in the southwestern part of the European continent. This is the country located in the western corner of continental Europe. It is bordered by Spain to the north and east and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south. Apart from mainland Portugal, the Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira are also part of Portugal's sovereignty. These are autonomous regions of Portugal. The name Portugal derives from its second largest city, Porto, whose Latin name is portugues gale.[1] Lisbon is the capital of Portugal and the largest city in the country. The official language is Portuguese. The territories within the boundaries of the present Portuguese Republic have been continuously inhabited since prehistoric times. After a period of rule by the Romans, Visigoths, and Suebi, the Muslim Moors conquered the entire Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century. They were later expelled. At the time of the Christian Redemption, in 1139, Portugal separated from Galicia and became a separate kingdom. It also earned the distinction of being the oldest nation state in Europe.[2] As a pioneer of the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal expanded western influence and established the first world empire,[3] becoming one of the world's most important economic, political, and military powers. In addition, the Portuguese Empire lasted about 600 years, the longest of modern European colonial empires. It lasted from the capture of Ceuta in 1415 until the liberation of Macao in 1999 and East Timor in 2002. This empire spread over a vast area that today includes 53 countries around the world. However, Portugal's international standing declined significantly in the 19th century, especially after the independence of its largest colony, Brazil. Portugal is a developed country with a very high Human Development Index. It ranks 19th in the world on the Quality of Life Index (2005) and 25th on Boomerang's Global Innovation Index.[4] It is one of the most globalized and peaceful countries in the world. It is a member of the European Union, the United Nations, the Latin Union, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, NATO, the Slovak Community, the Eurozone, and the Schengen Agreement. History  Early history  The early history of Portugal overlapped with that of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula. From the pre-Celts, the Celts who settled in the region, came the Chalecians, the Lusitanians, the Celtici, and the Cynets. The Phoenicians and the Carthaginians came to the region. Lusitania and part of Galicia were included in the Roman Republic. During the period from 45 BC to 298 AD, Suebi, Buri and Visigoths settled. Later the Muslims conquered these areas. Neanderthals lived in what is now Portugal in ancient times. Later the Omo Sapiens roamed the borderless northern Iberian Peninsula. This society was a subsistence society. Although they did not form prosperous settlements, they were an organized society. In Neolithic Portugal, attempts were made at herd animal husbandry, cereal cultivation, and rainwater lake or sea fishing. At the beginning of the first millennium BC, several waves of Celts from Central Europe mixed with the local population, forming a diverse ethnic group consisting of several tribes. Prominent among these are the Calaisians or Galicians of northern Portugal, the Lusitanians of central Portugal, the Celtici of Alentejo, and the Sainets or Goni of the Algarve. Fur Lusitania and Galicia Rome's first invasion of the Iberian Peninsula took place in 219 BC. Within 200 years the entire archipelago was incorporated into the Roman Republic. Rome's enemies, the Carthaginians, were driven out of the coastal settlements.  It took the Romans nearly 200 years to conquer what is now Portugal, and many young warriors lost their lives. As well as those captured as prisoners who were not sold in other parts of the empire, they met a quick death as slaves in the mines. In 150 BC there was a revolt in the north. The Lusitanians and other native tribes conquered western Iberia under Viriatasus. Urom sent a large army and the best generals to quell the revolt, but to no avail. The Lusitanians continued to conquer territories. Fur leaders decided to change their strategy. They gave a helping hand to his accomplices to kill Viriyatasu. Viriyatasu was killed in 139 BC. Daulatatsu became the leader. Rome established a colonial rule there. The Persianization of Lusitania was complete in the Visigothic period. Lusitania became a province of the Roman Empire in 27 BC. The Lusitanians lost their independence and became oppressed. Later, the northern province of Lusitania, called Galicia, arose. Its capital was Prakara Agasutta, known today as Braga. Ruins of hill forts still known as casudro and other remains of the casudro culture can be found throughout modern-day Portugal. Numerous Roman-era sites are scattered throughout present-day Portugal. Some urban remains are quite large. Examples are Conimbrica and Myrobrica. Muslim Iberia  It was part of the Portuguese Caliphate for approximately five and a half centuries, from the Umayyad Caliphate's conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 712 AD until its recapture by Afonso III of Portugal in 1249. After defeating the Visigoths within months, the Umayyad Caliphate quickly expanded its dominion within the island. Beginning in AD 711, the lands that make up present-day Portugal became part of the Umayyad Caliphate's empire, which stretched from the Indus River in India to areas south of France and centered on Damascus. In 750 the western part of the empire freed itself from the Caliphate and formed the Emirate of Cordoba under the leadership of Abd-ar-Rahman I. Almost two centuries later in 929, this emirate became the Caliphate of Cordoba. In 1031 it split into more than 23 smaller kingdoms called Taipa Kingdoms. The Taiba rulers established themselves as emirs of their provinces and established formal relations with the Christian kingdoms to the north. Most of Portugal was under the control of the Abdazid dynasty, Bataosu Taiba. Alandalus was divided into various districts called Kura. Garb al-Andalus was very large and included 10 Quras. Each kura had its own capital and governor. The important cities of that time were Paesa, Silves, Alcazar do Sal, Santarem, Lisbon and Coimbra.

"Breast cancer or breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Breast cancer refers to cancers that begin in the breast tissue, often in the inner layers of the mammary ducts or the follicles that supply milk to those ducts. Cancers that develop in ducts are called ductal carcinomas; Likewise, cancers that start in the follicles are called lobular carcinomas. Among breast cancers, there are several types of stage (disease spread), severity, and genetic factors: the basis of which is the possibility of recovery from the disease.[8] Computer models are available to estimate the life expectancy of a patient.[9] With the best treatments, the 10-year survival rate varies from 98% to 10%. These treatments include surgery, drugs (hormone therapy and chemotherapy), and radiation. Breast cancer accounts for 10.4% of all cancers in women worldwide, making it the second leading non-cutaneous cancer (after lung cancer) and the fifth leading cause of cancer death.[10] In 2004, breast cancer accounted for 519,000 deaths worldwide (7% of cancer deaths; 1% of all deaths).[11] Women are 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer than men, while survival rates are similar in both sexes.[12][13][14] Some cancers require hormones (triggers) to grow, such as female hormones (estrogen) and menstrual hormones (progesterone) and have receptors for those hormones. After surgery, such cancers are treated with drugs such as tamoxifen, which work with hormones and block the production of estrogen in the ovaries or elsewhere, which can affect the ovaries and chances of conception. After surgery, low-risk, hormone-stimulated breast cancers can be treated with hormone therapy and radiation alone. Breast cancers that lack hormone receptors, or that have spread to lymph nodes in the armpits, or that show some obvious hereditary characteristics are more dangerous and therefore treated more aggressively. An important drug, popular in the United States, is doxorubicin (Adriamycin) with cyclophosphamide, known as CA; These drugs can destroy the DNA in a growing tumor, while also killing rapidly growing normal cells, but they can cause serious side effects. Sometimes a taxane drug, such as docetaxel, is added, giving the drug a CAT name; Taxane destroys intracellular microtubules in cancer cells. A similar regimen popular in Europe is cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorosil (CMF).[15] Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, are used in cancer cells that have a HER2 mutation. Radiation is commonly used to destroy cancer cells missed during surgery, thus prolonging life, but if the heart receives radiation exposure, it can also lead to heart failure in the following years.[16] Categories of disease Breast cancer can be classified based on different stages. These include stage (TNM), pathology (pathology), grade (GRADE), receptor status and presence or absence of genes as determined by DNA testing: Cancer Stage The TNM classification for breast cancer is based on the size of the tumor (T), whether it has spread to lymph nodes in the armpit (N), and whether the tumor has metastasized (M) or spread to the most distant parts of the body. Larger size, spread to nodules, metastasis mean larger stage number and less chance of cure. Pathology Most breast cancers arise from epithelial tissue in ducts or lobules. (Cancers that arise from other types of tissue are called ""rare"" cancers.) Carcinoma in situ is the rapid growth of cancer cells in epithelial tissue that does not involve surrounding tissue. Invasive carcinoma can also invade surrounding tissue.[17] Tissues that divide too quickly quickly go into a state of poor repair. Tumor cell growth can be measured using the Ki67 protein, which can indicate whether the cell is in S phase and receptive to certain treatments.[18] Crate (Bloom-Richardson Crate). Once cells are differentiated, they take on different shapes and forms and determine the function of an organ. Cancer cells lose this classification. The cells line up in an orderly fashion and form milk ducts. Cell division becomes uncontrollable. Cell nuclei become irregular. Pathologists divide these cells into graded (low grade), partially graded (intermediate grade), and poorly graded (high grade). Chances of correcting poorly classified cancers are very low. receptor status. Breast cancer cells have receptors on their surface. Chemicals such as hormones bind to these receptors, causing changes in cells. Breast cancer cells may or may not have the following three major receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu. Cells with these receptors are called ER positive (ER+), ER negative (ER-), PR positive (PR+), PR negative (PR-), HER2 positive (HER2+), and HER2 negative (HER2-). Cells lacking any of these receptors are called basal cells or triple negative. ER+ cancer cells require estrogen to grow and are therefore treated with estrogen-lowering drugs. And these are often easy to cure. HER2+ cancer cells are depleted by drugs such as traduzumab and lethal doses of the drug doxorubicin. But in general, HER2+ has a very low chance of cure.[19] These receptors are detected by immunohistochemistry. Based on receptor status, breast cancer is divided into four molecular stages: (1) basal stage, ER-, PR-, and HER2- (triple negative, TN). Most BRCA1 breast cancers are basal-like TN. (2) Luminal A, which are ER+ and less graded (3) Luminal B, which are ER+ but mostly high grade (4) HER2+, which have amplified ERBB2.[19] DNA microarrays comparing normal cells and breast cancer cells have identified differences in hundreds of genes, but the significance of most of these differences remains unknown. Many diagnostic tests are commercially marketed, but their detection efficiency is very low. The only test supported by secondary evidence is Angotype DX, but it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is not certified by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. MammaPrint is supported by the FDA, but it only provides a third level of evidence. Two more trials have tertiary evidence: Tiros and MapQuant TX. No test is guaranteed to have prima facie evidence. (ie a prospective, randomized controlled trial in which participating patients had marginally better outcomes than nonparticipants). In a review, Sodrau said, ""Genetic testing in patients with HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors provides some prognostic information, but when results of clinical risk factors are confounding (eg, intermediate expression of ER and intermediate histologic grade), these guide clinical decisions. .""[19] Breast cancer is often, but not always, classified according to its histological appearance. Some rare types are defined by physical examination findings. For example, inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a type of ductal carcinoma or malignant cancer of the ducts, can be distinguished from other types of carcinomas by the inflamed appearance of the affected breast.[20] In the future, some pathological classifications may change. Signs and symptoms In case of breast cancer, there is a lump or lump somewhere in the breast There may be swelling and redness in the breast area. Symptoms include a white ooze in the hammock.  The first symptom that can detect breast cancer is knowing that the lump in the breast is different from other tissues. 80% of breast cancers are diagnosed as soon as a woman feels a lump.[21] When the breast mass becomes noticeable, it is the result of years of growth. Early breast cancers are detected through mammograms.[22] Lumps in axillary lymph nodes[21] may also indicate breast cancer. In addition to a change in mass, other symptoms of breast cancer include a change in breast size and shape, the appearance of lumps on the skin, the return of breast tissue, or spontaneous discharge from any tissue. Pain (""mastodynia"") is an unreliable tool in determining whether or not breast cancer is present, but it can help determine other breast health disorders.[21][22][23] When breast cancer cells attack the small lymph sacs in the skin of the breast called dermal lymphatics, their expression can cause inflammation of the skin, hence it is called inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include pain, swelling, irritation and redness across the breast, and an orange peel-like texture across the skin of the breast. It is referred to as Beau d'Orange.[21] Another symptom of breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This symptom is manifested by eczematoid skin changes. This means that the skin of the breastbone becomes red and slightly scaly. As Paget's progresses, irritation, itching, increased sensitivity, and pain may occur. There may also be some leakage from the comb. About half of women diagnosed with Paget's are also diagnosed with lymph nodes in their breasts.[24] Sometimes, breast cancer is a metastatic (metastatic) lesion, which means that the cancer can spread from the site of origin to other sites. Metastatic breast cancer may cause symptoms depending on the location of the metastasis. Common sites for metastases include: bone, liver, lung, and brain.[25] Even unexplained weight loss can sometimes be a puzzling sign of breast cancer, as can a fever or chills. Bone or joint pains can also sometimes develop as a result of metastatic breast cancer, as can symptoms such as jaundice or neurological symptoms. These symptoms are not ""specific"", meaning they may also be symptoms of other diseases.[26] Many symptoms of breast abnormalities do not indicate breast cancer. Breast [[Swelling/0} and benign breast disease such as fatty lumps|Swelling/0} and benign breast disease such as fatty lumps]] are common breast deformity symptoms. Patients and their doctors should be very careful about the appearance of new symptoms, because the risk of breast cancer is common among people of all ages.[27] risk factors Known primary risk factors are sex,[28] age,[29] childbearing or lack of lactation, and elevated hormone levels,[30][31]. In a study published in 1995, more extensive risk factors accounted for 47% of patients, and only 5% inherited the disease.[32] Specifically, carriers of the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have a 30-40% increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, depending on which part of the protein in the gene is mutated [33]. In recent years, it has been found that diet and other behaviors increase the chances of breast cancer. These additional risk factors include a high-fat diet,[34] alcohol consumption,[35][36] obesity,[37] and environmental factors such as tobacco use, radiation[38], endocrine disruptors, and shiftwork.[39] Although the amount of radiation received from breast x-rays (mammography) is very low, it can cause cancer with continued exposure. Along with the risk factors mentioned above, there are also demographic and clinical risk factors. They are: A history of breast cancer in the individual: A woman who develops cancer in one breast is more likely to develop cancer in the other breast. Family history: If a woman's mother, sister, or daughter has had breast cancer, that woman is more likely to develop breast cancer. This risk is even greater if a woman's family members developed breast cancer before age 40. This risk is increased even if someone in other relatives (mother or father) has had breast cancer. Specific breast changes: Some women's breast cells look abnormal when viewed under a microscope. Having certain types of abnormal cells (rare types of hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS]) increases the chances of developing breast cancer. Race: Breast cancer is diagnosed more often among Caucasian women than among Latina, Asian, or African American women. Abortion has not been found to cause breast cancer. However, the idea that abortion causes breast cancer continues to be promoted by some fetal protection groups.[40][41][42] The United Kingdom, a member of the International Cancer Genome Consortium, is leading efforts to identify the complete breast cancer genome. Chiropractic pathology  Like all cancers, breast cancer is caused by a defective gene interacting with its environment. Normal cells divide as much as needed and then stop. They stick to other cells and stay in tissues. Due to transformation, cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, adhere to other cells, and stay where they belong. When cells divide, their DNA is usually copied with many mistakes. Error-correcting proteins repair these mistakes. Mutations in p53, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are known to cause cancer, and these are error-correcting functions. These mutations may be inherited or acquired after birth. These are thought to be responsible for other transformations, such as uncontrolled division, loss of adhesion, and metastases to distant organs.[38][43] Normal cells, when they are no longer needed, commit suicide (apoptosis). Until then, they are protected from suicide by several protein complexes and pathways. One such protective pathway is the PI3K/AKT pathway; Another is the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Sometimes, some of the genes in these defense pathways mutate and switch them to be ""on"" all the time, making the cell unable to commit suicide even when the cell is no longer needed. This is one of the steps in cancer development along with other mutations. Normally, the PTEN protein shuts down the PI3K/AKT pathway as a cell prepares to commit suicide. In some breast cancers, the gene for the PTEN protein is mutated, so the PI3K/AKT pathway remains ""on"" and the cancer cells do not commit suicide.[44] Research has shown that breast cancer-causing mutations are associated with estrogen use.[45] Immunosuppression is the principle that the immune system will eliminate malignant cells throughout one's life.[46] Abnormal growth rate indicates malignant cell growth and interaction between stromal cells and epithelial cells.[47] [48]]] People in less developed countries are less affected by the disease than in developed countries. In the United States, 10 to 20 percent of people with breast or ovarian cancer report having a first-degree or second-degree relative with one of these diseases. Mutations in two major causative genes, breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2), increase the lifetime risk of breast cancer by 60 and 85 percent, and the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer by 15 and 40 percent. It also contains between percentages. However, mutations in these genes account for only 2 to 3 percent of all breast cancers.[49] Diagnosis Although diagnostic techniques (explained in more detail below) are used to determine the likelihood of cancer, additional tests are necessary to determine whether a detected tumor is cancerous and not a normal tumor. In clinical settings, breast cancer is diagnosed with a ""triple test"" of breast exam (breast exam by a trained physician), mammography, and fine-needle diagnostic cytology. Both mammography and a clinical breast exam are used to determine if a lump is cancerous, and sometimes even to determine whether other lesions are present. A test called fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is performed in the GP's office to try to remove fluid from the tumor using a numbing agent. Clear fluid indicates that the tumor is not cancerous, and blood-tinged fluid is sent for examination under a magnifying glass (microscope) to see if cancer cells are present. These three tests can be combined and used to diagnose breast cancer with very high accuracy. Other options for biopsy are core biopsy, in which part of the breast is removed, and excisional biopsy, in which the entire tumor is removed.   Dissected human breast tissue showed an uneven, dense, whitish stellate area 2 cm in diameter, with yellowish adipose tissue. A lymph node affected by ductal breast carcinoma and accompanying extranodal extension of the tumor. Neuropilin-2 expression of normal breast and breast carcinoma tissues. Lymph nodes in the breast  detection  Breast cancer screening is an attempt to detect early breast cancer in a healthy woman. It is believed that early detection can lead to easier cure. Several diagnostic tests are used, including: clinical and self-breast exams, breast x-rays (mammography), conventional testing, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. A medical or self-breast exam can detect lumps or other abnormal changes in the breast. There is no research evidence that better results are obtained with either of these types of breast screening, because when a lump is large enough to be detected, it may have been growing for many years and may be detected early without an exam.[50] Mammographic screening for breast cancer uses X-rays to look for any unusual lumps or lumps. In 2009, the Cochrane Collaboration found that mammograms reduce breast cancer survival by up to 15 percent. It also said it would create unnecessary surgery and complications. They concluded that mammography screenings do more harm than good.[51] However, many national organizations recommend routine mammography. For the average woman aged 50 to 74, the US Preventive Services Organization recommends mammography every two years.[52] The task force also indicated that frequent mammograms, along with unnecessary surgery and complications, are associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of breast cancer.[53] For women at high risk, such as women from families with a high incidence of female cancer, mammography screening is recommended at an early age, and additional testing such as BRCA genes and/or magnetic resonance imaging is also recommended. Mobile detection service Dr. K to diagnose breast cancer. Shanta Breast Cancer Organization launched a mobile diagnostic service in Tamil Nadu in 2012. A vehicle equipped with mammogram equipment is traveling to different parts of Tamil Nadu state to detect the signs of breast cancer at low cost. A private car manufacturer has donated a new vehicle for this service, which was started with an old vehicle. It can carry equipment that provides this service over long distances. Over 1,000 people used the service within a year of its launch.[54] Treatments  Breast cancer is treated first with surgery and then with drugs, radiation, or both. Treatments are given more aggressively based on detection and likelihood of recurrence. Early cancers with a good prognosis (DCIS or stage 1 or stage 2) are treated with lumpectomy and radiation alone.[55] Late-stage cancers that are less diagnosed and more likely to come back are treated with more intensive chemotherapy. These can have unpleasant and potentially life-threatening side effects, which are done to reduce the chances of recovery and recurrence. Medicines along with surgery are called adjuvant therapy. Hormone therapy is a type of adjuvant therapy. Some breast cancers require estrogen to continue to grow. These can be distinguished by the presence of estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) (sometimes referred to collectively as hormone receptors, HR+). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that block estrogen production or block receptors (such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors). Chemotherapy is given to treat severe cases of the disease. These are usually combined. One of the most common treatments is doxorubicin (Adriamycin) with cyclophosphamide, known as CA; These drugs destroy the DNA in the cancer, as well as the rapidly growing normal cells, which can cause very serious side effects. The most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is heart muscle damage. Taxane drugs, such as docetaxel, added to this combination are called CAT; Taxane attacks the capillaries in cancer cells. Another common regimen is cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), which produces similar results. (Chemotherapy can generally refer to any drug, but usually refers to traditional non-hormonal therapies.) Monoclonal antibodies are also sometimes used. Some cancer cells have receptors called HER2 on their surfaces. This receptor is normally stimulated by a growth factor that causes a cell to divide. Cells stop growing in the absence of growth factors. In breast cancer, the HER2 receptor remains ""on"" (constantly stimulated). This cell divides continuously without stopping. The monoclonal antibody traduzumab (Herceptin), when given against HER2, can help improve survival in these types of cancers. Other monoclonal antibodies are used to block other cancer functions in the cell. Radiotherapy is given after surgery to the site of the tumor, and for these microscopic tumors that may escape surgery, radiation therapy can be given as external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy). When dosed appropriately, radiation reduces the chance of cancer recurrence by 50–66% (risk reduction by 1/2–2/3).[56] Treatment methods are continually reviewed in randomized, controlled trials. In this review, individual drugs, combination drugs, and radiation techniques are also examined. From this individual and combination drugs are compared. American Society of Clinical Oncology, San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium,[57] and St. St. in Gallen. The latest study results are published annually at scientific meetings such as the Gallen Oncology Conference.[58] These studies are peer-reviewed by professional experts and other institutions, and organized according to specific treatment groups and risk categories, defined as disciplines. Disease prognosis Prognosis is the prediction of the outcome of the disease, usually the percentage of death (or survival), and the percentage of disease-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS). These assumptions are made based on experiences with similar types of breast cancer patients. A disease prognosis is approximate because patients with the same classification are likely to live for different lengths of time and classifications are not always accurate. Calculated as the median number of months (or years) that 50% of patients survive, or the percentage of patients still alive after 1, 5, 15, and 20 years. Prognosis is of great importance for treatment decisions, as patients with long-term survival are offered less aggressive treatments such as lumpectomy and radiation or hormone therapy, while patients with less likely survival are offered more aggressive treatments such as radical mastectomy or additional chemotherapy drugs. Prognostic factors include staging, tumor size and location, and grade. These determine whether the disease is systemic (metastasized, or spread to other parts of the body) or recurrent, and the age of the patient. Stage is very important as it helps to determine the size, extent of the area affected, the status of the lymph nodes and whether the disease has spread to other areas. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the worse the outcome. This standard depends on whether the disease has spread to the lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the severity of the cancer cells. This standard is reduced depending on the presence of non-cancerous areas and motility (grading) similar to normal cells. Size is not an important factor unless the cancer has spread. Stage zero is stage zero when ductal carcinoma in situ has spread throughout the breast. Grading is based on how the biopsy was performed and the behavior of the cells grown. As long as cancer cells stay close to normal, their growth is slower and the outcome is better. If cells cannot be classified correctly, they appear immature, and divide more rapidly and proliferate more rapidly. Highly classifiable is classified as grade 1, moderate as grade 2, and poor or unclassifiable as grade 3 or 4 (depending on the scale used). Adolescent women have a worse disease outcome than postmenopausal women due to many factors. Because their breasts are more mobile due to their menstrual cycles. They may be nursing infants, and are unaware of the changes in their breasts. Therefore, young women are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease at an advanced stage. There may also be biological reasons for the increased risk of breast cancer recurrence in young women.[59] The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors on cancer cells is of great importance in tailoring therapy when prognosis is unpredictable. Individuals who do not test positive for these specific receptors may not benefit from hormone therapy. Similarly, HER2/neu status determines the duration of treatment. Patients with cancer cells that test positive for HER2/neu have an aggressive disease course. They are treated with traduzumab, a monoclonal antibody that attacks these proteins. Along with alkaline phosphatases, elevated CA15-3 has been shown to increase the chances of breast cancer recurrence.[60]  Left breast seriously affected by recurrent breast cancers.  Psychological components The diagnosis of cancer, its symptoms, treatment and related complications are very serious. Most major hospitals have cancer support groups, which provide a conducive environment for patients to interact with and understand the characteristics of cancer survivors. Online cancer support groups can also be very helpful for cancer patients, especially when dealing with issues common to cancer, such as uncertainty and poor health. Not all breast cancer patients feel the same discomfort. After cancer is diagnosed, many factors such as age determine the course of the disease. Premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer may experience earlier menopause due to the induction of many chemotherapy drugs given to treat their breast cancer, especially hormonal drugs used to suppress ovarian function. They must overcome this.[61] In another study, researchers from the College of Public Health at the University of Georgia found that older women had a harder time recovering from illness than younger women.[62] Women over 50 are more likely to develop breast cancer and have lower survival rates. Therefore, breast cancer continues to be an age-related problem. More extensive research and different treatment regimens for different age groups should be developed.[62] Disease spread  Globally, breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women after skin cancer. It accounts for 16% of all cancers in women.[64] This percentage is double the rate of bowel and cervical cancers. Three times as likely as lung cancer. It causes 25% more deaths than lung cancer among women worldwide.[10] In 2004 alone, the number of women who died from breast cancer worldwide was 519,000. (7% of cancer deaths and 1% of all deaths).[11] Since the 1970s, the incidence of breast cancer has increased significantly worldwide, partly due to modern lifestyles.[65][66] The incidence of breast cancer varies widely around the world, being lower in less developed countries and higher in more developed countries. In twelve world regions, annual age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 women were: 18 in East Asia; in South Central Asia, 22; 22 in the sub-Saharan region; 26 in South East Asia; 28 in North Africa and West Asia; in South and Central America, 42; in Eastern Europe, 49; in Southern Europe, 56; in Northern Europe, 73; Oceana, 74; Western Europe, 78; and 90 in North America.[67] Breast cancer is closely related to age, with only 5% of women under 40 developing breast cancer.[68] America It is estimated that 1 in 8 (12.5%) women in the United States will develop breast cancer, and 1 in 35 (3%) will die from it.[69] A recent study refutes this prediction, finding that only 6% of healthy women are susceptible.[70] The incidence rate of breast cancer in the United States is the highest in the world; The incidence is 128.6 per 100,000 in white women and 112.6 per 100,000 in African Americans.[69][71] It is the second most common cancer (behind skin cancer) and the second leading cause of cancer death (behind lung cancer).[69] In 2007, breast cancer was expected to cause 40,910 deaths in the United States alone (7% of cancer deaths; 2% of all deaths). [22] This number includes 450–500 men who die annually out of 2000 cancer deaths.[72] Over the past few years, breast cancer incidence and death rates have continued to decline among Native Americans and Alaska Natives in the United States.[22][73] However, although heart disease is the most common cause of death among women[74], breast cancer remains the most feared disease among women in a 2005 study conducted in the United States.[75] Many doctors report that women overestimate the risk of breast cancer.[76] Racial inequality Although white women are diagnosed with the highest rates of breast cancer in the United States, many studies have shown that black women are the most likely to die. Even after diagnosis, black women are far less likely to receive treatment.[77][78][79] Scholars posit several reasons for these disparities, including inadequate access to diagnosis, less availability of more advanced surgical and medical procedures, or certain biological characteristics that predispose to disease in some African American populations.[80] Some studies have shown that ethnic disparities in breast cancer may be due to cultural rather than biological differences.[81] Research into the role of biological and cultural factors is ongoing.[78][82] England Annually, 45,000 cases are diagnosed and 12,500 die. 60% of patients are treated with tamoxifen. In 35% of these cases, the drug fails.[83] Developing countries As developing countries develop, they adopt Western culture, and thus adopt Western culture's habits (fat/alcohol intake, smoking, oral contraceptives, changing habits in childbearing, breastfeeding, fewer children, etc.) and thus have opportunities to acquire many of the diseases that originated there. For example, as South America began to develop, so did the number of breast cancer cases there. ""Breast cancer is a major health problem in less developed countries such as South America. In countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, it is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The expected number of cases and deaths from breast cancer in 2001 is approximately 70,000 and 30,000, respectively."" [84] However, due to lack of adequate funding and resources, breast cancer patients often do not receive treatment. History Breast cancer is one of the oldest cancerous tumors diagnosed in humans. The oldest description of cancer has been found in Egypt and is said to date back to 1600 BC. The Edwin Smith Papers describe 8 types of tumors or ulcers that were treated by cauterization.""Writing about this disease, he wrote, ""There is no cure for it.""[85] For centuries, physicians had been writing about similar diseases with the same conclusion. Better about the circulatory system. After gaining understanding in the 17th century, they learned of the connection between breast cancer and lymph nodes in the armpits. Their successful work was continued by William Stever Halstead, who began performing mastectomies in 1882. The Halstead radical mastectomy involves removing both breasts and the underlying lymph nodes. This can cause long-term pain and paralysis, but removal is necessary to prevent cancer recurrence.[86] Radical mastectomies remained the only option until the 1970s, when metastasis was widely understood, cancer was recognized as a systemic, yet site-specific disease, and few methods of staging were developed and useful. The most famous women who died of breast cancer include Queen Theodora, wife of Justinian; Queen of Austria, mother of King Louis XIV of France; Mary Washington, George's mother, and Rachel Carson, an environmentalist.[87] The first controlled case study of breast cancer prevalence was done by Janet Lane-Claybone, who submitted to the British Ministry of Health in 1926 a comparative study of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control cases in people of similar background and lifestyle.[88][89] Society and Culture  There has been an acceptance of second opinions before surgery, low-impact surgical procedures, support groups, and other advances in patient care. This is partly due to the actions of the Breast Cancer Advocacy Movement.[90] October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and is observed by the media, survivors, those affected by the disease, and friends and families of those who have died from it.[91] A pink ribbon is worn to commemorate the struggle of cancer patients.[92] Agatha of Sicily is credited as the pioneer of breast cancer.[93] In early 1991, Susan G. Koeman presented pink ribbons to participants in the Race for Breast Cancer Survivors.[94] The pink and blue ribbons were designed by Nancy Nick in 1996. This is John W. Nick is the founder and chairman of the Foundation. The organization's mission is to raise awareness that ""Men Get Breast Cancer Too!"".[95] In 2009, male breast cancer advocacy groups Out of the Shadow, A Man's Pink and the Brandon Greening Foundation for Breast Cancer in Men joined forces to declare the third week of October as ""Male Breast Cancer Awareness Week"".[96] Precautions Women over 35 years of age are more likely to develop this breast cancer. Therefore, women over 35 years of age should avoid clothes that squeeze the chest tightly, do moderate exercise daily, eat food with the right amount of vitamin C and A, and have a breast examination by a gynecologist once a year to help prevent breast cancer. If any close relative like grandmother, mother, great-grandmother, step-daughter or sister has cancer, it is better to be extra careful.

"In physics, the density of a substance refers to how much mass or density the substance has in a given volume. For example, one cubic centimeter of gold has a mass of 19.32 grams. But the same density of silver per cubic centimeter is only 10.49 grams. So the ""density"" of gold is greater than the density of silver. The density is given by the following equation.     r =   m V     {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}}   SI Units: ρ = (Rho or Rho) the density of the material (unit: kg/m-3, kg·m-3} m = mass or mass of object (unit: kg, kg) V = volume (volume) of the object (unit: m3) Density is how many grams per centimeter while mass or density is in grams and density is in units of cubic centimeters (cubic hundredths of a meter).

Among these have been found ancient flutes with hand-drilled holes. Several flutes dating from about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany. These flutes bear witness to a musical tradition that flourished in Europe from pre-modern times.[1][2] Flutes, including the famous pansuri, were made in BC. It has been an integral part of Indian classical music since 1500. Kannan, a primary deity in Hinduism, carries a flute. Semantics and Terminology Between 1150 and 1500, the flute first appears in English as floute [3] or else flowte, flo(y)te [4], in Old French spoken between the 9th and 14th centuries as flaute, in Old Oxythum, or and in Old French flaüt, [3] fleüte, flaüte, flahute.

And it dates back to about 43,000 years ago. However, this remains controversial.[13][14] In 2008 another flute dating back at least 35,000 years was discovered again in the Hoehl Fells Cave, near Ulm, Germany.[15] This flute has a V-shaped mouth with five holes. It is made from the wing bone of a deceased eagle. The researchers involved in this discovery officially published their findings in the journal Nature in August 2009. [16] This discovery is older than any musical instrument found in the history of the world, [17] the discovery of flutes in Germany's Ziachenskösterler cave that revolutionized history was estimated to be between 42,000 and 43,000 years old. [2] The flute in literature There are numerous references to this instrument in the ancient literature of India. Sangha literature of Tamil also talks about pipe. In the Aichiyar Kuravai in Silapathikaram, there are 3 types of pipes mentioned as Kannaikuzhal, Amber kuzhal and Mullaikuzhal. Depicted as being held by Kannan, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, the flute also has religious significance. Murugan was the first to play the flute. Krishna does not exist. The period of Krishna is five thousand years. Lord Muruga is without beginning and end. In the Tirumurukatu force, ""Khujalan Kotan Krumpal Liathan"" comes as Gujal means flute. The harp is a synthetic instrument. The flute is a natural instrument. ""Khuzalinidu Yajinitu means people ""Hear the nursery rhyme"" Valluvar says, first the kuzal and then the yaha.

A photograph of Irakoto Bra (died 2001), a famous contemporary sotina player, is printed on one of the country's banknotes. system The flute is made from the ""wood"" of bamboo, a type of grass. Hence it got the name flute. They cut a bamboo tree that is neither young nor old and keep it in the shade for one year to make a pipe. Being a simple instrument consisting of a tapered bamboo tube of uniform diameter, with a hole at the tip for blowing through the mouth, and a fixed number of different holes to change the sound into different tones by opening and closing with the fingers, it is an instrument easily accessible to people from all walks of life. The length of the flute is 15 inches; Circumference 3 inches. The left side is closed. The right side is open. There are total 9 holes in the tube. The first hole to be blown with the mouth is called mudra or mudra hole. This hole is slightly further apart than the space between each of the other eight holes. Reading method  7 fingers should be placed on the 7 holes of the pipe to be read. The 8th hole is no sin. Remove the thumb and little finger from the left hand and place the remaining 3 fingers on the right hand fingers except the thumb on the 7 holes, blow air through the mouth into the seal hole, and close and open the holes to create music. As the length of the flute increases, the pitch decreases as the internal volume increases. Even though the flute has 7 holes for 7 suras, the technical tunes can be played correctly depending on the breath level of the player. Various hoses  Flutes are made in different ways with various minor modifications to correspond to many different types of music around the world.

"A mammal (Sri Lankan case: malayuti) is a warm-blooded animal that feeds its young. The heat required for their survival is generated from the movement of their bodies. Mammals have mammary glands in their skin. Most mammals are four-legged. They have hair on their skin. Most mammals feed live young. Only very few mammals lay eggs and hatch their young. According to the 2008 census of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), there are 5,488 species of mammals in the world.[1] Mammalogists have grouped it into 1,700 species worldwide.

Molecular-based classification of ecology Molecular studies based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis over the past few years have revealed new relationships in mammalian families. Most of these findings have been independently verified by data on the presence or absence of retrotransposons. [3] A classification system based on molecular studies reveals three main groups of ecological mammals that diverged from the Cretaceous: Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria.

Many features were shared among early mammal species. Jaw joint Middle ear Tooth replacement Prismatic enamel Occipital condyles Special characteristics of mammals Leopard's jaw Man's lower jaw Origin of the human middle ear Human femur (red colored area)  Biological Modules Most mammals, including bats, camelids, whales, and humans, have seven cervical spines. Mammals such as the manatee and the two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth have nine cervical spines. found[4]. All mammalian brains contain the mammalian neocortex [5]. Unlike marsupials such as kangaroos and monotremes such as hedgehogs, placental mammals have a connective tissue called the corpus callosum [6]. habitat Mammals live in many different habitats. They live in high mountains, forests, snowy regions, arid deserts, water bodies like oceans, rivers, etc. They adapt themselves to the habitat. Drawings found on high mountains; polar bears living in snowy regions; camels living in deserts; whales that live in the ocean; otters living in rivers; They include deer, tigers, lions etc. living in forests or plains. Mammalian species Bat A bat has the ability to fly. It is the only vertebrate (vertebrate) mammal capable of flight. This animal is called bat and bat. There are more than 1000 species of bats. It is known that only 20% of these can be found in mammals. Taxonomists group bats into the order Chiroptera. Most bats are small-faced (short-faced), about 70 percent mouse-like. All bats eat insects. Bats spend most of the day hanging upside down. After the sun goes down, they start browsing in search of prey. They only search for food at night. Bear Bear is a carnivorous mammal. Polar bears and grizzly bears belonging to this species are the largest of the carnivores. Some smaller species of bears, such as the Asiatic black bear, are omnivorous. Polar bears are large in size. They are white in color which makes them hard to find in the icy polar region. In the language of the Eskimos, Arctos means the land of the bears. Hence the name ""Arctic"" came to the North Pole region. Camel Camel is a herbivorous mammal that lives in deserts. Generally, there are six subspecies of the camel species known as camels. They are native to the deserts of Asia and North Africa. Generally, they live for 30 to 50 years. Cat Cats are other carnivores of the mammal family. These are domesticated by humans. Domesticated cats also eat a vegetarian diet. In ancient Egypt, cats were worshiped animals. They were raised and worshiped at home. When the cats died, they built pyramids for them too, and buried the trained mice inside the pyramids. The kings and their cats were assigned places in the pyramids. the cow A cow is a mammal. Due to the fact that cow's milk is rich in many nutrients, man considered it as an important food item. In Indian culture, cow is a revered animal. According to Puranas, Kamathenu and Nandini are divine cows. the dog Dog is an animal species belonging to omnivore mammal. Today it mostly lives with humans. Humans, who lived approximately 17,000 [7] years ago, are said to have domesticated wolves and turned them into domesticated dogs. Studies of deoxy-ribonucleic acid DNA strands from extinct organisms suggest that dogs may have been domesticated as early as 150,000 [8][9] years ago.

India has the third largest internet user base in the world with 137 million internet users as of June 2012.[4][5] Telephone, internet service and television are the main components of the Indian telecommunication industry. The modernizing telecommunications industry is deploying digital telephones, landline switching centers, media gateways and signaling gateways as state-of-the-art telephone network core components to transition to next-generation networks; Optical fiber or microwave radio serial networks are also established to interconnect these. The access network that connects subscribers to the core of the network is a variety of copper cables, fiber optic cables and wireless technologies. DTH is a new technology that is being widely used in the television industry. Since the introduction of private broadcasting in the private sector, the sector has seen tremendous growth. The Indian National Satellite Block of the country is of great help to the Indian Telecom. This block is one of the largest networks of domestic satellite blocks in the world. All parts of the country are provided with telephone, internet, radio and television services by various types of telecommunication technologies.[6] The telecommunications sector, which operated as a government monopoly under the Government of India's Department of Telecommunications, was opened up to the private sector by the government's liberalization policies in the 1990s; It has since grown rapidly to become the most competitive and fastest growing telecommunications market in the world.[7][8] The sector had 846 million subscribers in 2011, up from 37 million subscribers in 2001; It has grown twentyfold in the last ten years.[1] With a base of 929.37 million landline users as of May 2012, India has the second largest landline population in the world.[6] With 137 million internet users in June 2012, India is the third largest internet user in the world. [4][5] The total revenue of the Indian telecom industry grew by 7% to ₹283,207 crore (US$40billion) in the 2010–11 financial year.[9] The telecommunication sector has contributed to the socio-economic development of the country. It has played a significant role in bridging the demographic divide between rural and urban areas. It also helps to introduce e-governance to increase the transparency of the government. The government is using modern telecommunication facilities to provide widespread mass education to the rural population of India. [10] State/district governments use telecommunications to coordinate relief efforts and raise awareness during disasters. History initiation  The history of Indian telecommunication industry starts from the day of introduction of telegraph. India's postal and telegraph sector is one of the oldest in the world. In 1850, the first experimental telegraph line was laid between Calcutta and Diamond Arbor. It was opened for use by the British East India Company in 1851. Then the newly created Department of Posts and Telegraphs functioned in a small corner of the Public Sector Office.[11] Later, in November 1853, the work of laying telegraph poles for a distance of 4,000 miles (6,400km) connecting Calcutta and Peshawar and connecting Agra, Mumbai, Chennai, Utgamandalam and Bangalore was started. William O'Shaughnessy, who pioneered this, was a civil engineer. During his time he did a lot of work to improve telegraph and telephone services in India. After telegraph services were opened to the public in 1854, a separate department was established. In 1890, two telephone companies (Oriental Telephone Company and Anglo-Indian Telephone Company) requested the then Indian government to establish telephone lines in India. They were refused permission on the grounds that the telephone service would be nationalized and the government would terminate the service. But in 1891 the government reversed its decision and allowed England's Oriental Telephone Company to set up telephone exchanges in Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Ahmedabad; Telephone service started for the first time.[12] 28 On January 28, 1892, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras telephone lines were opened. The Calcutta branch, named ""Central Branch"", initially had 93 subscribers.[13] Growth and milestones Before 1902 – Wire telegraph 1902 – The first wireless telegraph station is established between Sagar Island and Sandhead. 1907 – First central battery telephones installed in Kanpur. (Batteries were installed in the telephone line not at the subscriber's house) 1913–1914 – First automatic switchboard established at Shimla. 1927 – Radio-telegraph system established between United Kingdom and India. Indian stations were established at Garki and Daunt. It was opened on July 23 by Lord Irwin exchanging greetings with King George V. 1933 – Radiotelephone system started between India and United Kingdom. 1953 – 12-band Kavit telecommunication system launched. 1960 – The first direct subscriber line was opened between Lucknow and Kanpur. 1975 – First pulse signal modulation system installed between Mumbai city and Andheri telephone line. 1976 – First digital microwave link. 1979 – The first fiber optic system was launched in Pune to connect local networks. 1980 – The first satellite ground station for domestic telecommunication was established at Secunderabad, UP. 1983 – The first programming control unit carrying a serial signal for out-of-town channels is inaugurated in Mumbai. 1984 – C-Dot was established to develop and manufacture digital connectors locally. 1995 – The first non-commercial mobile phone service was launched in Delhi on August 15, 1995. 1995 – Launched on August 15, 1995 in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Pune.[14] Development of Broadcasting: Although radio broadcasting was introduced in 1927, it was only in 1930 that it was carried out in the government sector. In 1937 the organization was renamed as All India Radio. Since 1957 it has been known as Aagasvani.[15] A short-time television service was introduced in 1959, but full-time broadcasting began in 1965. The Department of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India supervised it and the television service Doordarshan. Prasar Bharati was formed as an autonomous organization in 1997. All India Radio and Doordarshan became its constituents.[10] Pre-Liberalization Statistics: During the British era, all major cities and towns of the country were connected by telephone service, but the total number of telephones in operation in 1948 was only 80,000. After independence, the Indian government could not provide adequate financial support as telephone development was seen as a status symbol. In 1971 the number of telephones was 980,000; In 1981 it rose to 2.15 million; 5.07 million in 1991 when the liberalized policy was introduced. These were mostly capital- and labor-intensive landlines.

"Bold characters     Part of a series on Renewable energy Biofuel Biomass Biogas Geothermal Hydropower Solar energy Tidal power Wave power Wind power Topics by country Marketing and policy trendsvt Solar power is the extraction of electricity from sunlight. It is obtained directly in the photovoltaic mode of operation and indirectly in the concentrating or concentrating solar power (CSP) mode. In the concentrator method, large amounts of sunlight are bent, and mirrors are concentrated into a small beam that evaporates water to produce electricity. In photovoltaics, sunlight is directly converted into electricity using the photoelectric effect.[1] Solar energy is used to meet the electricity demand by converting the solar radiation energy when available to the photovoltaic cells into electrical energy. With modern technology there are solar power plants that are produced in photovoltaic cells. They have a power generation capacity of over a hundred megawatts. These have grown exponentially in the current period (2012). Since sunlight is available during the day, the electrical energy obtained from sunlight can be used at night by storing it in a battery. applications Solar energy is the conversion of sunlight into electricity. Sunlight can be converted directly into electricity using photovoltaics or indirectly through solar power (CSP). Generally, water is boiled by concentrating the sun's energy into the water. Electricity is produced by this method. And the Stirling engine uses technologies like the Stirling cycle engine through the dish to power the electric motor. Initially, photovoltaics were used for small and medium applications. These range from calculators powered by a single solar cell to making homes self-sufficient with photovoltaic arrays. Solar power plants can incur high installation costs. However, the learning rate is decreasing because of the diagram. Because solar radiation is intermittent, solar power is usually combined with storage or other energy resources to provide continuous power. However, surplus measurement makes it transparent to the consumer, even though a small amount is distributed to the producer/consumer. In Germany, a small-scale experimental wind, natural gas, hydro-electricity, and solar power generation hybrid power plant was set up as a practical example, resulting in 100% renewable energy generation.[2] Fully integrated solar power According to one legend, Archimedes used polished shields to concentrate sunlight and cast it on invading Roman soldiers, driving them out of Syracuse.[3] In 1866, Auguste Mousseau produced steam for the first solar steam engine, using a parabolic tank.[4] Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use bows or mirrors in an array to concentrate sunlight from a large area into a small beam. The accumulated heat is used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. Enrichment technologies are of many types; Parabolic trough, concentric Fresnel reflector, Stirling dish and solar tower are the most advanced. Various techniques are used to track the sun and concentrate the light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by concentrated sunlight and then used for power generation or energy storage.[5] A parabolic trough consists of a long parabolic reflector. The reflector focuses light onto a reflector positioned along the focal line. The reflector is a tube fixed directly above the center of the parabolic mirror. It is filled with fertile fluid. The telescope is set to track the Sun in a single beam during the day. Parabolic trough systems offer better land use factor than any other solar technology.[6] SEGS facilities in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada represent this technology.[7][8] The Sandroff-Mulk parabolic trough was developed by Melvin Pruett. The rotation of mirrors was influenced by Archimedes' theory.[9] Concentrated linear Fresnel reflectors are concentrated solar panels. Instead of parabolic mirrors, they use thin glass to focus sunlight onto two tubes containing a propellant gas or liquid. The advantage of using flat mirrors is that they are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors. Also, placing additional reflectors in the same space allows for greater utilization of available sunlight. Concentrated focal Fresnel reflectors can be used in larger or more compact halls. In the Stirling solar disc, a parabolic concentric disc A stirling coupled with a heat engine normally drives an electric generator. Advantages of Stirling solar cells over photovoltaic cells are high efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and long life. A solar tower uses a series of tracking reflectors (heliostats) to focus light onto a reflector located on a central tower. Power towers are very cost-effective; They offer increased efficiency and improved energy storage capability within concentrated solar power technologies.[7] Solar Two of Barstow, California and Planta Solar 10 of Sanlucar la Mayor, Spain are examples of this technology.[7] A solar bowl is a mirror mounted on a spherical disc. The array created by the disc is reflected back to the focus (as opposed to a stationary focus with a tracking parabolic mirror). Photovoltaics It is based on the invention of Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel. He observed that certain materials emit electrons when they are hit by photons from light. They produce electric current.[10] In the 1880s, the first solar cell was constructed by Charles Britts.[11] However, the prototype selenium cell converted less than 1 percent of the light falling on it into electricity. Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this invention.[12] Following Russell Ohl's work in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Darryl Chapin developed the silicon solar cell in 1954.[13] Such early solar cells cost US$286 per watt and had efficiencies ranging from 4.5 percent to 6 percent.[14] Solar energy has a lot of potential. But in 2008, it provided less than 0.02 percent of the world's total energy supply. There are many competing technologies. There are fourteen types of photovoltaic cells among them. These include thin film, monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon and amorphous batteries. There are also many types of concentrated solar power. Knowing which technology will dominate is premature. The earliest notable post-supply operation of solar cells was the power source for the Vanguard I spacecraft in 1958. It allowed the spacecraft to transmit data continuously for more than a year even after the chemical battery was depleted.[15] The successful operation of solar cells in this project was replicated in several Soviet and American spacecraft. By the end of the 1960s, photovoltaics became a viable option for spacecraft.[16] After the successful deployment of solar panels on the space shuttle Vanguard, photovoltaic solar panels found external use in space shuttle propulsion until the power crisis of the 1970s.[17] Photovoltaics began to play an essential role in the success of earlier commercial spacecraft such as the Telstar. And they continue to be important in the basic structure of communication today. The high cost of solar cells limited their worldwide use throughout the 1960s. This changed in the early 1970s. Lower cost levels then made photovoltaic generation competitive in remote areas without grid access. Early geostationary applications included powering communications stations, offshore oil rigs, ship guidance buoys, and railroad crossings.[18] Such non-electric operations accounted for more than half of the installed capacity worldwide as of 2004.[19] The oil crisis of 1973 spurred a rapid increase in photovoltaic production in the 1970s and early 1980s.[20] Increased productivity and improvements in organizational performance resulted in cost reductions through mass production; Reduced the cost of photovoltaics from US$100/watt to US$7/watt in 1985.[21] Declining oil prices in the 1980s led to a reduction in R&D funding for photovoltaics. It also stopped tax concessions related to the Power Tax Act of 1978. Such factors moderated growth to about 15 percent annually between 1984 and 1996.[22] Since the mid-1990s, leadership in the photovoltaic industry has shifted from the United States to Japan and Europe. Between 1992 - 1994, Japan increased research and development funding. Net quantity guidelines are established. It also introduced a subsidy program to encourage the installation of residential photovoltaics.[23] As a result, photovoltaic installation in the country increased from 31.2 MW in 1994 to 318 MW in 1999. Also, global productivity growth increased to 30 percent in the 1990s.[24][25] Germany has become the world's leading photovoltaic market since revising input tariffs as part of its Renewable Energy Resources Act. Installed photovoltaic capacity in Germany increased from 100 MW in 2000 to approximately 4,150 MW at the end of 2007.[26][27] After 2007, Spain became the largest photovoltaic market as it installed half of the world's photovoltaics (45%) after adopting such a feed-in tariff structure in 2004. France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States have recently seen rapid growth due to various stimulus programs and local market conditions.[28] The power output of home photovoltaic devices is usually described in kilowatt-peak (kWp) units. Most of them fall within 1 to 10kW.[29] Concentrated photovoltaic power is another new method of generating electricity from the sun. Concentrated photovoltaic systems manipulate sunlight and focus it onto a photovoltaic surface to produce electrical power. All types of solar collectors can be used. They are mounted on the solar track. This is to keep the focus on the battery as the sun moves across the sky. Flat plate photovoltaic production can increase by 20 percent in winter and 50 percent in summer.[30] Experimental solar power An 'updraft' solar tower (solar cage or solar tower) has a greenhouse that leads through a funnel to the central tower. When sunlight shines on the greenhouse, the air inside is heated and expanded. The expanding air flows toward the central tower, where a turbine converts the flowing air into electrical power. A 50kW raw prototype was installed in Ciudad Real, Spain. It operated for eight years and was decommissioned in 1989.[31] Thermoelectric or ""thermostat"" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electrical current. In the 1800s, a solar energy storage system was first proposed by the solar discoverer Maussow. Electricity generated by thermodynamics reappeared in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.[32] A concentrated system under the direction of Soviet scientist Abram Loff used the energy produced by temperature change to drive a 1 hp engine.[33] Thermal power generation later became an energy-conversion technology in the US space program. It was used to power space missions such as Cassini, Galileo and Viking. This research focused on increasing the efficiency of these devices from 7 to 8 percent to 15 to 20 percent.[34] Development, sustainability and economics  Energy consumption, which began with an increase in coal use during the Industrial Revolution, has shifted steadily over the intervening period, shifting from wood to waste materials and then to fossil fuels. The early development of solar technologies in the 1860s was motivated by the expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, the development of solar technology was stunted in the early 20th century by the increasing amount of coal, the economy, the use of coal, and the concentration of petroleum.[35] The oil embargo of 1973 and the energy crisis of 1979 caused a realignment in energy policies around the world. It also brought renewed attention to solar technologies.[36][37] Termination strategies focus on incentive programs. These are the United States' Central Photovoltaic Utility Project and Japan's Sunshine Project. Other initiatives included the establishment of research facilities in the United States (SERI now NREL), Japan (NEDO) and Germany (Braunhofer Solar Energy Systems Institute ISE).[38] Photovoltaic installations grew rapidly between 1970 and 1983. But declining oil prices in the 1980s moderated photovoltaic growth from 1984 to 1996.[39] The market for photovoltaics has grown at an average rate of 40 percent per year since 2000. The installed capacity was 10.6 (GW) gigawatts at the end of 2007,[19] and increased to 14.73 (GW) gigawatts in 2008.[40] Since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics under unconditional long-term power consumption agreements. In 2007, 50 percent of trading systems were established this way. And by 2009, 90% is expected.[41][42][43] Commercial concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) plants were first developed in the 1980s.[44] Spain's 11 MW PS10 power tower was completed in late 2005. It is the first commercial CSP system in Europe. A total of 300 MW of capacity is expected to be installed in the same region by 2013.[45] In August 2009, First Solar announced plans to build a 2-GW photovoltaic system in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China, in four phases: 30 MW in 2010, 970 MW in 2014, and another 1,000 MW in 2019. As of 9 June 2009, a new solar thermal power plant was under construction in Banaskantha district of North Gujarat. When completed, it will be the largest manufacturing plant in the world.[46]  Solar power installations have also begun to extend into residential areas in recent years. These coupled with government incentives make ""green"" energy a more economically viable alternative. RESOP (Renewable Energy Sustainable Supply Program) was introduced in Canada in 2006.[47] It was renewed in 2009 with the passing of the Green Energy Act. Ontario allows residential homeowners to sell power produced by their solar panel installations back to the grid (i.e. the government) for 42¢/kWh, while receiving power from the grid at an average price of 6¢/kWh (see Feed-in tariffs).[48] The scheme was designed to help boost the government's green index and reduce the load on the power grid that is often placed during peak periods. In March 2009, for small and roof-mounted systems (≤10kW), the proposed FIT was increased to 80¢/kWh.[49]  The annual International Solar Photovoltaic Investments Conference organized by EPIA states: PVs offer a safe, reliable return on investment, lasting 25 to 40 years on a typical unit scale, with a return on investment of 8 to 12 years.[52] Financial incentives supporting solar power generation installations are aimed at increasing demand for solar photovoltaics and making them competitive with conventional power generation. Another innovative way to drive demand is to harness the green consumption power of educational institutions (universities and colleges). It has been shown to be a powerful catalyst with a positive spiral-effect for non-conventional resources worldwide.[53] Power saving methods  Since solar energy is not available at night, energy storage is important to ensure continuous power availability.[54] Both wind power and solar power are intermittent resources, which means that all available output must be taken when it is available and can be used as and when needed or relocated to wherever it is used through transmission lines. Wind power and solar power are not complementary, combining high winds in winter and high sunlight in summer. But the difference between sunless and windless days needs to be addressed in some way.[55] Solar Two uses this energy storage mechanism to store enough heat in its 68 m³ storage tank to deliver a full output of 10 MWe for 40 minutes with an efficiency of around 99%.[56] Salts are an efficient storage medium because they are low cost, have a remarkably high thermal capacity, and can release thermal conditions similar to those of conventional thermal power systems, with the ability to eliminate solar intermittency. Surplus solar energy can be stored in the form of heat and this heat can be used overnight or during periods when solar energy is not available to generate electricity. This technology has the potential to rapidly generate solar energy, which can be used thermally to generate electricity on demand. Solar power installations are usually coupled with additional storage or other energy resources, for example wind power and hydroelectric power. Off-grid photovoltaic systems have traditionally used batteries to store excess electricity for power re-concentration. In grid-connected systems, excess power can be sent to the power distribution grid. Net metering schemes give such systems a concession for the electricity they supply to the grid. This concession is made to supplement electricity from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, using the grid as an efficient storage back-up arrangement. The concessions are usually extended from month to month and any remaining surplus is settled annually.[57] Pumped-storage hydropower reservoirs store electricity in the form of pumped water from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation reservoir when excess power is available. Power is recovered when demand increases and the water is released: the pump becomes a turbine, and the propulsion becomes a hydroelectric power generator.[58] Consolidating energy resources into a powerhouse also targets warehousing issues. Kassel University's Institute of Solar Energy Technology has piloted a hybrid power plant from completely non-conventional resources combining solar, wind, waste gas and water to provide alternative electricity.[59] Notes  External links    The solar thermal industry experienced a boom in 2007, with 100 megawatts of new capacity worldwide.

"A doll is a plaything. While toys are generally associated with children and domesticated animals, sometimes adults and even non-domesticated animals are seen playing with toys. Many toys are manufactured to be used as toys. However, objects with other primary uses can also be seen being used as toys. Some toys are only meant to be collected by toy lovers. Do not use them to play. However, some people also use it for playing. Games and toys help us learn about the world and develop. Children use toys to learn about the world, build their physical strength, learn about reactions, understand interactions, and develop skills they will need as adults. Adults use toys to increase social interaction, teach children, remind them of their childhood lessons, train the mind and body, practice skills they may not use everyday, and beautify their living space. Beyond mere entertainment and play, toys and the ways in which they are used create an impact on many aspects of life. Toys are made of clay, plastic, paper, wood, metal etc. Toys have been in use since prehistoric times. Dolls depicting children, animals and warriors have been found in archaeological sites. A 4,000-year-old stone doll was found in the village of Pantaleria, one of the Italian islands, during an archaeological survey in 2004. However, there is no evidence that it was used for sport.[1] History Toys, a favorite of children, have evolved over the years with the art, culture, science, society and time of the world. Although the history of toys cannot be precisely predicted, various changes can be made based on the images and their durations can be determined. Toys have been used not only for children's play but also in various disciplines including learning, magic, spirituality and ritual. In the Indus Valley Civilization (3010 - 1500 BC) there are depictions of children using carts, wind and string-powered reclining monkey toys. [2] Egyptian children used paddle toys from the 2040s - 1750s BC. There are studies of the use of puppets with arms and legs made of stone, pottery, and wood.[3] Ancient stories mention that ancient Greek girls had dolls as early as 100 AD. There is also a tradition of Greek girls dedicating their toys to the gods during their wedding ceremonies.[4][5] Roman dolls were made of clay, ivory, wood, cloth, etc. Dolls have been found in the graves of Romanian minors. Children are also known to dress up dolls in this era. Rag toys were also used by fur babies as early as the 300s AD.[6]  African tribes around Ghana, Akuaba wooden dolls with big heads are given to the mother's daughter as a gift and ritual object. Aguaba dolls from the Ashanti tribe have flat heads.  Traditional Japanese dolls differed from the Toku Period (8000-200 BC) clay to the Late Haniwa Period (300-600 AD) baked clay dolls. As late as the eleventh century, Sappan dolls were used for children's play and for protection in religious ceremonies. Similar to Kolu in South India, during the Hinamatsuri festival, Japanese traditional dolls are arranged in rows on the steps. These puppets are made of straw, wood, painted and dressed in layers of elaborate clothes and displayed. These include spherical, irisless whitish and red bodied Daruma dolls. These dolls commemorate Bodhi Daruma of Pallava descent who traveled from South India and spread Zen Buddhism and fathered the art of Kung Fu. Wooden Kokesi dolls resemble girls with cylindrical bodies without limbs. Carved in Russia in the 1890s, matryoshka dolls are nested inside a hollowed-out wooden box. Burning effigies of evil spirits can be found in African, Native American, and European cultures. Dussehra or Ravana festival in India is done in this way. Magicians of many countries practice witchcraft by comparing the figure of dolls to a person and piercing the doll with tiny nails. Its veracity is subject to scrutiny. Culture Toys are not only a medium of play for children but also a replica of a country's culture or art. Religion, time, society, customs, etc. can be predicted with toys. Children's skill development Toys fascinate children and inculcate qualities such as perseverance, curiosity, motivation, success, pride and self-sufficiency. Children develop many skills through play. Through this relational learning system helps to remember easily. Toys simplify children's learning process of mathematics, history and social studies. Gender Toys have gender differences. Gender differences can be identified by the uses of the minors (boys, girls) who use them and by the morphologies of the toys. economy Toys of minors have a huge economic market due to factors like their preference, well-known popularity, modern marketing (a) New arrivals, inventory and compulsion to produce more. Barbie doll (Barbie dall), teddy bear dolls became world famous. Their market value even today varies between models. The decorations of these dolls vary according to the culture of each country and race. Indian toys Navratri worship and toys Kolu[7] is the practice of worshiping nine nights during the Navashakti festival by placing small dolls of deities and sages in stages in Hinduism. In South Indian states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, idols of deities are arranged in a row during Navratri. The structure and decorations of the dolls will bring out the creativity of the woman.  There are puppets depicting mythological characters, especially Dasavathara puppets (ten incarnations of Tirumala), the three goddesses (Kalimala, Malaimala, Thiruma), Ganesha, Shiva, Brahma, Murugan, etc. Along with this, Marapachi dolls, Thanjavur-Talayyati dolls will also be placed in this collection. Koluvana is a celebration of India's many places where puppets are stacked together to celebrate its glory. Generally, wooden and clay puppets from various places such as Etikopaka (Andhra Pradesh), Kondapalli (Andhra Pradesh), Kinnal (Karnataka), Channa Pattinam (Karnataka), Thanjavur (Tamil Nadu) are traditionally used. There will also be dance puppets with choreography such as Bharatham, Kathakali, Dhandiya, Odissi, Karakattam, Poikkal Nidhya, etc. to celebrate the Indian dance arts. Dolls as social model forms are also used as models for various functions, offices, social halls, industrial establishments etc. Tanjore dolls Puppets are a testament to Tanjore's unique artistic technique and artistry.  Thanjavur puppeteer These dolls are made of clay and painted in various colors and the head is fixed vertically with a small wire and it vibrates. This is why it got its name. The base of the body is flattened or flat, with only the head gently swaying at the top. For example Chettiar and Chettichi dolls are smiling and nodding their heads. A bouncy toy The head and body are united and arranged in a conical shape. These dolls are basically hemispherical in shape. It also has a small heavy bullet. The cone-like top hangs vertically so that it moves no matter how you shake it with a rocking stance. Due to the force of gravity, the position will eventually stop vertically. Dancing Monkey Doll The head and body are separated by separate wires and made to tilt and swing. These puppets are suspended vertically with a single string at the top and a cone at the base, so they move. The head, body and feet of the dancing mangai doll are brought from places like Cuddalore, Puducherry and Kanchipuram. Notably, the Government of India intervened in 2008-09 to obtain a geographical indication for toys.[8] Wooden toys Marapachi dolls are medicinal toys made of spearwood used by children in Tamil Nadu in the mid-twentieth century. These dolls are meant to represent various family relationships and represent the image of God. They are of two types, dyed and non-dyed. Girls also enjoy playing with various decorative ornaments. Among these marapachi dolls, wedding groom and bride dolls are very popular.  Shredded toys Channapattina dolls are the traditional Indian culture dolls that have been produced in the village of Channapattina in Karnataka state for many years. These are made of elephant wood (a), ivory wood, nukka wood, and sandalwood (rarely) with various colors. Bhavas Mian is known as the father of Channapattina dolls. He made toys using Japanese techniques he had learned. Later he made dolls with the help of local artisans according to Indian art and tastes. Categories Construction toys Building-shaped stacking toys are of this type. Small prints come together to form a shape that supports a shape. Puppets (a) Puppets Miniatures or small hand-held models of humans, animals, fictional characters, etc. Carriage Forms (a) Small toys Carts fitted with wheels and pulled from one place by a small cord and toys with a small handle. These toys are generally preferred by male minors and are associated with male children's toy games. Automatic toys Robots are also used as toys powered by batteries. Children are attracted by specific motion signals, small lights, and sounds. Moving toys Automatic step machine toys are rotated by a machine wheel or coils by means of keys. Thus they move from one place to another by running, jumping, spinning, rolling etc. Safety regulations As toys are mostly made of iron, cotton, plastic, its use and environmental protection should be taken into consideration. Children should be prevented from consuming. Old toys should be disposed of properly. Children should be protected from the nature of toys, sharp edges, wires, chemical coating and germs. Animal models Various toys are made based on the animals living in the forest. With these, models of forests can be easily created. An example of a forest ecosystem can be explained to children through relational learning.

The Victorian era saw the benefit of small children in factories and mines. Likewise there were strict social norms regarding modesty and gender roles. Under the Qing dynasty, Japan undertook a rapid modernization program following the Meiji Restoration before defeating China in the First Sino-Japanese War. Contribution to medicine Advances in medicine and the understanding of human anatomy and disease prevention took place in the 19th century, and rapidly increasing population growth in the Western world meant that Europe's population doubled in the 19th century, from approximately 200 million to over 400 million. Transportation  It provided the first major advance in land transportation for centuries. People lived and bought things. It fueled major urbanization movements in countries around the world. During this century many cities around the world passed the population of a million or more. London became the largest city in the world and the capital of the British Empire. Its population increased from one million in 1800 to 1.7 million. Earth's last remaining subterranean moons, including vast expanses of Africa and Asia, were explored this century. Development of cities The 19th century was notable for the widespread creation of new settlement foundations. They were particularly widespread throughout North America and Australia. It was established at some point in the century by a significant number of the largest cities on both continents. Chicago in the US and Melbourne in Australia were absent in previous decades. But by the end of the century it had grown to become the second largest cities in the American and British empires respectively. About 70 million people left Europe in the 19th century. This changed to most of the Americas.[5] Abolition of Slavery Act Slavery was greatly reduced worldwide. Following a successful slave revolt in Haiti, Britain and France escalated their war against the Barbary pirates and succeeded in ending the enslavement of Europeans. England's Abolition Act allowed the British Royal Navy to end the global slave trade. The first colonial empire of the century was the British in 1834 to abolish slavery. Following their Civil War, the United States' 13th Amendment abolished slavery in 1865, and Brazil abolished slavery in 1888. Similarly, Paris was abolished in Russia. game The 19th century saw the rapid creation, development and codification of many sports in Spain, particularly in Britain. During the 19th century, football, baseball and many other sports were developed. At the same time the British Empire helped the game of cricket to different parts of the world. Also, women were a topic of great importance during this period, where women were stigmatized for showing their ankles. It marked the fall of Ottoman rule in the Balkans. It also led to the creation of Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Romania as a result of the Second Russo-Turkish War.

"Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It is also the smallest planet in the solar system. It takes 88 days to go around the Sun once. Seen from Earth it appears to take 116 days. No natural moons are known for it. [lower-alpha 1] This planet is named after the Roman messenger god Mercury in Western culture. Mercury is named after the god of knowledge in Indian culture. Because the angular separation of Mercury from the Sun is low (at most 28.3o), Mercury is rarely seen due to the brightness of the Sun. That is why our sages say that even if you get gold, you will not get Mercury. Morning or evening twilight is the perfect time to see Mercury. Because Mercury lacks an atmosphere to retain heat from the Sun, Mercury's surface experiences greater temperature fluctuations than any other planet; Near the equator it is 700K (427°C; 800°F) during the day and 100K (−173°C; −280°F) at night. At the terminals (poles) it is always cold below 180K (−93°C; −136°F). Mercury's axis has the lowest inclination (about 1⁄30 degrees) in the Solar System. But its orbital deviation is very high. [lower-alpha 2] It does not have seasons like most other planets. Mercury is 1.5 times as far from the Sun as it is at ecliptic. Mercury orbits the Sun in the most unique way in the Solar System. As seen from the fixed stars, it revolves around itself three times in two revolutions of its orbit.[13] As seen from the Sun, which has an orbital index, it orbits once every two Mercury years. Mercury's Ascendant has one day for two years. Mercury is almost similar in appearance to Earth's moon. It is characterized by many large craters with cuttings. Like Earth, Mercury has no atmosphere. But unlike Earth, Mercury has an iron-rich interior. Due to this, Mercury also has some magnetic field. It must be said that not much is known about Budha. Mariner 10 was the first of two spacecraft to approach Mercury. It approached Mercury in 1974–1975 and mapped 45% of its surface. A second mission, MESSENGER, took another 30% image when it flew by Mercury in January 2008. It again approached Mercury in 2009. Then on March 18, 2011, it was inserted into the orbit of Mercury (orbital insertion) and became a satellite of Mercury. infrastructure   Mercury is one of the four terrestrial planets of the solar system. Like the Earth, it is made of rocks. It is the smallest planet in the solar system. Its equatorial radius is 2,439.7 km.[14] Mercury is approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate.[15] It is the second densest planet in the solar system with a density of 5.427 kg/cm3. It is the density of Earth at 5.515 kg/cm3.[14] A little less than Magnetic field and magnetosphere  Despite its small size and slow 59-day rotation, Mercury has a significant, pervasive, magnetic field. According to measurements taken by Mariner 10, Mercury's magnetic field is 1.1% stronger than Earth's. is the strength of the magnetic field at Mercury's equator.[16][17] Like Earth, Mercury's magnetic field is dipole.[18] But unlike Earth, Mercury's magnetic poles are closely aligned with the planet's spin axis.[19] The strength and shape of this magnetic field are consistent with measurements from the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER spacecraft.[19] Like Earth, the magnetic field here is also created by the electromagnet effect.[20][21] This electrifying effect is caused by the circulation of the planet's ferrous liquid core. Fluctuations due to the planet's extreme orbital deviation help keep the nucleus in a hydrostatic state.[22] Mercury's strong magnetic field deflects the solar wind around the planet. Due to this, a magnetic field is formed around the planet. It is small enough to capture the solar wind. This causes the surface of the planet to be rubbed by space.[19] Observations by Mariner 10 have detected low-energy plasma in the magnetosphere in the nightside of the planet. Swarms of energetic particles have been detected in the planet's magnetotail; It also shoots the planet's magnetosphere activity.[18] During its second flyby on October 6, 2008, MESSENGER found Mercury's magnetic field very ""leaky"".[23] from earth When viewed from Earth, Mercury is most likely to be visible when it is at its greatest elongation. Physics means that most of it can be seen from Earth (only half of it is illuminated by the sun. When viewed from Earth, only half of the illuminated area can be seen). case. But according to this physical case, most parts of Mercury cannot be clearly seen. The reason for this is the apparent luminosity of Mercury. So Mercury can be seen easily when the cuvex lines are bent. That is, it can be clearly seen by the naked eye of observers a few days before the eastward extension and a few days after the westward extension. Possibilities of Humanity in Mercury Moon like Mercury  From the point of view of moon settlement, the same things are required for moon settlement. Additionally, heat shields are required to escape the heat of the sun. A fixed moving settlement should also be created for this. (See image on the right) The solar energy available here is very high so electricity can be easily obtained. The advantage of this is that you can get six and a half times more electricity here than you can with solar panels on Earth. Water source Mercury has water ice at its poles. These are places without sunlight for billions of years, so they are not evaporating today. The abundant ice found in the deep craters at the north pole of Mercury is thought to be balls of ice that were dropped by stars billions of years ago. Obstacles In this, creating more techniques for the monitor settlement, finding and developing a method of making heat shields for this, and creating high-pressure and high-speed spacecraft to go from this planet to another planet are major obstacles for the monitor settlement on Mercury.

"Animals are a large group of mostly multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia or Metazoa. Their body plan eventually stabilizes as they grow. Some go into a metamorphosis process later in life. Many animals are migratory. They can move spontaneously and freely. Many animals are also carnivorous. That means they have to eat other organisms to survive. Many known animal groups appear in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, about 542 million years ago. Name history The English word ""animal"" is derived from the Latin word animale. It is derived from the word anima which means vital breath or soul. In everyday colloquial usage, the term usually refers to non-human animals. The biological definition of the term Kingdom Animalia refers to all members including humans. Properties Animals have many characteristics that distinguish them from other animals. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular organisms[3] (see also Myxozoa). These separate them from bacteria and many other organisms. They are carnivorous.[4] Digestion usually takes place in a chamber. This separates them from plants and algae (although some algae have photosynthetic and nitrogen-fixing abilities).[5] They also differ from plants, algae, and fungi in lacking firm cell walls.[6] It can be said that all animals are migratory at certain life stages [7]. In many animals, the embryo progresses to a stage called an embryo. This is a characteristic unique to animals. Physique Animals have bodies that are divided into separate tissues. However, there are some notable exceptions, namely the sponges (class Porifera) and Plagozoa. The body includes muscles that contract and control movement, and nervous system tissue that transmits and processes signals. Usually a built-in digestion chamber is also located with one or two openings. Animals with this type of organization are called metazoans (multicellular organisms). or eumetazoans where the former is commonly used to refer to animals. Reproduction and growth Almost all animals engage in some form of milk reproduction. They have a few specialized reproductive cells. Meiosis takes place in these to produce small motile spermatozoa or large meiosis eggs. These unite to form zygotes, which develop into new organisms. Many animals also have the ability to reproduce asexually. (By parthenogenesis) Fertile eggs are produced unfertilized, or in some cases by fragmentation. An ovum develops initially within a sterile sphere called the blastula. It undergoes reorganization and differentiation. In sponges, the globular larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new species of sponge. In many other groups, the nucleus undergoes a more complex rearrangement. It first folds inwards to form a gastrula, a digestive chamber, and a gastrula with two separate germ layers – an outer ectotherm (outer layer) and an inner endotherm (inner layer). These tissue layers then undergo differentiation to form tissues and organs. A source of food and energy Predation is a biological exchange event in which a predator (a carnivorous animal that hunts) feeds on its prey (the target organism). Predators may or may not kill their prey before eating it. But hunting always ends in the death of the prey. Another major category of consumption is detritivory. That means eating food that contains dead organic matter. Sometimes it becomes difficult to distinguish between the two eating habits. For example, parasitic organisms prey on and feed on an organism. They then lay their eggs on the decomposing body to feed their offspring. The selective pressures exerted by one on the other have led to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. This has led to various anti-predation adaptations. Many animals get their food indirectly from sunlight. Plants use this energy by converting sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) molecules, photosynthesis converts sunlight energy into chemical energy stored in glucose (C6H12O6) bonds and releases carbon dioxide (O2). These sugars serve as building blocks and allow the plant to grow. When animals eat these plants (or other animals that may have eaten the plants), the sugars made by the plant are used by the animal. They can be used directly for the animal to grow, or they can be broken down and release the collected sunlight energy to give the animal the power it needs to move. This process is called glycolysis. Sources and fossil record Animals are generally thought to have evolved from a flagellate eukaryote. Their closest living relatives are thought to be the zoonoflagellates, flagellates with necks morphologically similar to the zoonocytes of some sponges. Molecular studies classify animals into a specialized group called opisthokonts. These include zoonoflagellates, fungi and some small parasitic unicellular organisms. The name derives from the fact that motile cells have flagellum, a posterior arrangement similar to that found in the mature sperm of many animals. Other eukaryotes tend to have anterior ligaments. The first fossils that may represent animals appear in the pre-Cambrian period. These are fossils dating back to about 610 million years ago. However, these are difficult to correlate with later burials. Some modern animal groups may belong to separate groups, even if the prediction is correct; There is also the possibility that they are not animals at all. Apart from them, most of the known animal groups originate from about the same period in the Cambrian period, about 542 million years ago. Whether this event, known as the Cambrian explosion, represented a rapid divergence between different groups or a change in conditions that made fossilization possible is still debated. Yet paleontologists and geologists who study primitive life forms through fossils suggest that animals may have existed much earlier than previously thought, possibly as much as 1 billion years earlier. Fossil traces such as tracks and pits found in the Thonian period indicate that triploplastic worms such as medozoans may have been nearly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms.[8][9][10] Animal blocks Porifera  For a long time it was thought that sponges (foraminifera) first diverged from other animals. As mentioned above, they lack the complex anatomy found in many other animal blocks. Their cells are undifferentiated. But in many cases it is not organized into separate tissues. Seaweeds are adherent. They generally feed by drawing water through pores. However, a 2008 study of 150 genomes in 21 species[11] revealed that hair jellies may be the basic pathway of animals, at least 21 of them. Both have distinct tissues, but are not organized into organs. There are only two major germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm. Only cells are scattered between them. As such, these animals are sometimes called diploblastic animals. Smaller placozoans are similar. But they don't have a permanent digestive chamber. The rest of the animals form a monophyletic group called Philateria. For the most part, they are bilaterally symmetrical. They often have a distinctive head with feeding and sensory organs. The body is threefold. All three microbial layers are well-developed. Tissues make up well-sorted organs. The digestive chamber has two openings. There is also a mouth and an anus, another internal body cavity called the coelom or pseudocoelom. However, there are exceptions to each of these characteristics – for example, mature echinoderms are radially ipsilateral. Some parasitic worms have very simplified body structures. Genetic studies have led to significant changes in our understanding of relationships within phyla. Most seem to belong to two main lineages, deuterostomes and protostomes. Deuterostomes Deuterostomes differ from other phyla, called protostomes, in several ways. Both have a complete digestive tract. However, in protostomes the primary opening (archenteron) develops into the mouth, and the anus develops separately. In deuterostomes this is reversed. Deuterostomes have a dorsal, rather than a ventral, nerve sheath. and their germ cells undergo a different cleavage. All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages. The major groups of deuterostomes are Echinodermata and Chordates. The former are equilateral in shape, living only in seawater, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The latter are dominated by vertebrates, which are animals with backbones. These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Satonatha or arrow worms can also be deuterostomes. But recent studies suggest their protostome affinities. Ectisazova  Ecdyszoa are protostomes. They are so named from their common habit of growing by winging or shedding (ecdysis). Arthropoda, the largest animal group, belongs to it. This includes insects, spiders, crabs and their relatives. All these organisms are generally divided into continuous body segments with appendages. Close relatives of Arthropoda are two suborders, Onychophora and Tardigrada. These share similar characteristics. Ecdyszoa also contain nematodes or roundworms. They are the second largest animal group. Roundworms are generally microscopic and can be found in almost any water-based environment. Many are important parasites. The Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and Kinorinja, Priapulita, and Loricifera are related suborders. These segments have a reduced coelom called pseudocoelom. The remaining two divisions of protostomes are sometimes grouped together into a single division called Spiralia. The reason is that in both the germinal cells are formed with spiral cleavage. Platizova  Platyzoa includes the order Platyhelminthes and Platyhelminthes. These were initially considered to be some of the most primitive types of philateria. But it is now thought that they may have evolved from a more complex ancestor.[12] A large number of parasites such as flukes and tapeworms are included in this group. Flatworms are hollow.[13] Other Platyzoa phyla are mostly pseudocoelomates. The most important of these are the Rotifera organisms. They are most common in aquatic environments. These include Acanthocephala or needle-headed worms, Nathostomulita, Micronathosoa, and possibly Cyclophora.[14] All of these categories share complex jaws. Hence they are called Gnathifera. Lobotrossova  The Lobotrosazoa includes the two most successful animal orders, the Mollusca and the Annelida.[15][16] The second largest group of animals includes snails, clams, and clams. The latter includes segmented worms such as earthworms and cards. These two genera have long been considered closely related because of the trachophore larvae they have in common. But Annelida are considered closest to Arthropoda.[17] Because both have a stated body.[18] Lobotrosaszoa also harbors nemertia or ribbon worms, sipuncula, and several pods that contain a fan of a dense hairy structure around the mouth called a lophopore.[19] They have traditionally been grouped together as lophophorates.[20] But they are now considered to be paraphyletic,[21] some closer to the Nemertia, and some closer to the Mollusca and Annelida.[22][23] These include the Brachiopoda or lampreys, Enterophracta, Boronida, and possibly Bryozoa or bryozoans, which are predominant in the fossil record.[24] Model organisms Because of the great diversity found in animals, it is more economical for scientists to study a small number of selected species, make connections between the work of different scientists, and draw conclusions from them about how animals behave in general. The most intensively studied multicellular animal (metazoan) model organisms are the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Cenohaptidis elegans because of their ease of rearing and maintenance. They were also the first life forms to be genetically coded. The position of their genetic block facilitated this. But the flip side of that is that many genes, introns and genetic links are missing. Little can be learned about these ectyzozoans in general through animals. The extension of this type of evolution within the superphylum is revealed by the currently evolving crustacean, mollusc, and mollusc gene plans. A study of the starlet sea anemone genome emphasized the importance of coding sequences in sponges, placozoa, and zooanoflagellates in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancient genes unique to Imetazoa.[25] A study of the sponge Oskarella carmela suggests that the genetic makeup of the common ancestor of sponges and immetazoa was more complex than previously assumed.[26] Other model species belonging to the animal kingdom include the mouse (Mus musculus) and the zebrafish (Danio rerio).  Taxonomic history Aristotle divided the living world into animals and plants. This was followed by Carl von Linné's classification in chronological classification. Since then biologists have begun to stress evolutionary relationships. So these groups are somewhat restricted. For example, protozoa were initially considered animals because they are motile. But now they are considered as a separate category. In Linnaeus' original classification, animals were grouped into three kingdoms: Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. The first and last four were brought into a single phylum called Chordata. Many other forms have been isolated. The above lists represent our current understanding of this section. However there is some variation by source.

"The African Union is an international organization made up of 54 African countries. Morocco is the only country on the African continent that is not included in this system. The organization was created on 26 May 2001 in Addis Ababa and established on 9 July 2002 in South Africa[1] to replace the Organization of African Union (OAU). The vision of the African Union is to bring African countries under a single political, economic and security umbrella. The Union's objectives are to establish democracy on the African continent, protect human rights, build sustainable economies, reconcile local conflicts, and create an African common market. Membership Countries in Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Sahara are members of the African Union. Morocco was unilaterally excluded and four countries are currently suspended. The following countries are members of the African Union.[2]  Suspended members – Suspended after the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état.[3] – Suspended following the 2009 Malagasy political crisis.[4] – Suspended after the 2012 Guinea-Bissau coup.[5] – Suspended after the 2012–13 Central African Republic conflict.[6] Audience members – Eighty obtained observer member status at the 18th African Union Summit held in Addis Ababa on 2 February 2012.

"Vertebrate (Latin: Invertebrata) is an organism without backbone. Invertebrates are the most abundant species in the world and out of about 10 lakh species, more than 8 lakhs are invertebrates. Scientists have divided invertebrates into several groups. Protozoa are single celled species among them. Breathing, eating, digesting food and excreting waste products are all done within a single cell. But these unicellular organisms are so microscopic in size that they can only be seen through a microscope. Some of these are topped with slightly harder tiles. The dead mass of these microorganisms is the slaked lime found in the sea. Each protozoan organism divides into two and reproduces into separate organisms.

"Although not related to the common cold, gastroenteritis, also known as stomach flu, is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract involving both the stomach and small intestine. This results in severe diarrhea. (See also Gastritis and Appendicitis). It is transmitted from person to person through contact with contaminated food and water. This inflammation is often caused by some type of toxin infection, sometimes by microbes and their toxins, parasites, or an allergic reaction to food or medicine. Globally, between five and eight million people die each year[1] due to inadequate treatment of gastroenteritis. It is the leading cause of death for infants and children under the age of five.[2] At least 50 percent of gastroenteritis caused by foodborne illness is caused by norotoxins.[3] Rototoxins account for another 20 percent and account for the majority of severe disease in children. Other important toxins include adenotoxins and astrotoxins.[4] A variety of microbes can also cause gastroenteritis. These include Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Capylobacter jejuni, Claustrodium, Escherichia coli, Yersinia, Vibrio cholerae|Vibrio cholerae and many others. Improperly cooked food, repeatedly heated meats, seafood, dairy products etc. are sometimes responsible for this infection. Each organism exhibits slightly different symptoms. But it all results in diarrhea. Colitis, inflammation of the colon, can also occur. Risk factors include consuming undercooked food or contaminated water and living in or traveling to waste disposal sites in poor conditions. It is also common for people swimming in the river due to the pollution of the river during the rainy season.[5] Disease classification Infectious gastroenteritis is caused by a variety of microbes and toxins. Infectious gastroenteritis should be considered a disease that cannot be diagnosed with great confidence. Due to invasive infection, loose stools and vomiting may develop in some cases. These can be caused by colds, septicemia caused by microorganisms entering the bloodstream, urinary tract infections, or even brain fever. Colitis, appendicitis, and Hirschsprung's disease are some of the conditions that require surgery and may lead the doctor to make the wrong decision. Endocrine disorders like thyroid disease and Addison's disease can also cause diarrhea. Pancreatic insufficiency, small rectal block syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and misuse of laxatives should be excluded as possible factors.[6] Microscopic gastroenteritis For a list of microorganisms that cause gastroenteritis, see above: Colitis is an important cause of diarrhea in patients treated with antibiotics. If a child's diarrhea is severe enough to require hospitalization, it is important to differentiate whether it is caused by a microorganism or by a toxin. Bacteria such as Shigella and Campylobacter and parasites such as Giardia can be treated with antibiotics. Traveler's diarrhea is a common example of diarrhea caused by microbes. Toxic gastroenteritis Rototoxins, norotoxins, adenotoxins, and astrotoxins are toxins that cause gastroenteritis. Bacteria do not respond to antibiotics. Infected children recover completely after a few days.[7] Children admitted to the clinic for gastroenteritis are routinely screened for Roto A toxin. Through this, rototoxins can collect information on the pest necessary for vaccination programs.[8][9] These children are also regularly tested for noro-toxin. It is a very serious infection. Infected patients should be isolated from other patients to prevent further spread. Other methods are also used in research laboratories, such as contrast electron microscopy and palagremid electrophoresis.[10][11] Signs and symptoms Gastroenteritis typically involves a noninflammatory infection of the small intestine or an inflammatory infection of the anus with abdominal pain or cramps, diarrhea, and/or vomiting.[1][6][12][13] The condition usually begins acutely and usually resolves spontaneously after one to six days. Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea loss of appetite fever Headaches Abnormal ventilation Abdominal pain Abdominal cramps Bloody stools that indicate an infection with amoebas such as Capylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, or some species of hematopoietic Escherichia coli: Abdominal abscess.[4] Dizziness and weakness The main reason for this is too little feeding of infants. Diarrhea is common and may be followed by vomiting. Diarrhea caused by toxic bacteria causes frequent watery stools. Bloody diarrhea may indicate microbial colitis. Sometimes, bile water can induce vomiting even when the stomach is empty. A child with gastroenteritis may have lethargy, sleeplessness, low-grade fever, dehydration (including dry phlegm-like soft skin), rapid heart rate, skin laxity, skin discoloration, sunken palate, sunken eyelids, dark circles around the eyes, very little organ. Symptoms include entrainment and finally neuropathy. Diagnosis Gastroenteritis is diagnosed based on symptoms, a thorough medical history, and a physical examination. An accurate medical history can provide useful information to indicate the presence or absence of symptoms similar to the disease in other members of the patient's family. Also relevant are the time the patient passes stool, its frequency and detail, and whether he experiences vomiting. These questions are usually asked by the doctor when examining the patient.[14] The majority of patients with simple gastroenteritis do not require specific diagnostic tests. If symptoms such as fever, bloody stools, and abdominal cramping persist for more than two weeks, it is prudent to screen for Clostridium difficile and Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and enterotoxic Escherichia coli through a stool test. Microscopic examination can also help detect parasites, unfertilized eggs and cysts. A thorough medical history can help diagnose gastroenteritis. A complete and accurate medical history of a patient should include his travel history, exposure to toxins or other irritants, changes in diet, food preparation or storage practices, and medications. Traveling patients may be exposed to E. coli infections and parasitic infections in beverages and food. Swimming in contaminated water or drinking fresh water from dubious mountain springs or wells can cause infection with Giardia. It is an organism found in water that causes diarrhea. Food poisoning should also be considered when the patient is exposed to undercooked or improperly stored food. Depending on the type of microorganism that causes the disease, the after effects can develop anywhere from two to 72 hours. Knowing which infection caused the disease is essential for proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Doctors may also want to know if patients have used broad-spectrum or multi-drug antibiotics in their recent medical history. If so, they may be responsible for the bulging of the gastrointestinal tract. During the physical examination, the doctor will look for other possibilities of infection. Medical conditions such as appendicitis, gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, and appendicitis can produce similar symptoms. However, on physical examination, a soft abdomen can be seen in such cases. This is not the case with gastroenteritis. Diagnosis of gastroenteritis is primarily an exclusion-based procedure. Therefore, on the rare occasion that gastroenteritis is not diagnosed, several tests may be performed to ensure that gastric disorders are not present. These include rectal examination, complete blood cell count, electrolysis and kidney function tests. However, when symptoms are definite, tests other than stool examination are not necessary to diagnose gastroenteritis, especially when the patient has traveled to high-risk areas. Prevention methods  Rototoxin vaccine has reduced the incidence of gastroenteritis in the United States from 2000 to 2009.[15] Gastrointestinal inflammation can also be prevented through immunity.[16] In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved Rotatec, a rototoxin, for infants between six and 32 weeks of age to prevent toxin-induced gastroenteritis.[17] However, these bugs can cause flu-like symptoms. A variety of vaccines are available for Salmonella typhi and Vibrio cholerae. These are paid to people traveling to high-risk areas. However, currently available vaccines are not effective against gastroenteritis caused by toxins other than rototoxins. The disease can be prevented by following proper hygiene measures, especially in those who are susceptible to it. It is advised to wash hands thoroughly before eating and after using the toilet or changing toilets. Also, avoid consuming contaminated food or drink. Toxic gastroenteritis is a serious infection. Thus, avoiding crowded markets, theaters, and shopping streets may also help those with weakened immune systems. Doctors recommend properly cooked and stored food to prevent gastroenteritis. Also, bleaching contaminated clothing will also prevent the spread of germs. Alternatively, using household chlorine bleaching products in contaminated areas can also reduce the chances of infection.[18] Managing Gastroenteritis is usually a serious and self-limiting disease. It does not require drug treatment.[19] The goal of treatment is to restore lost fluids and electrolytes. Oral rehydration therapy is preferred for balancing such mild to moderate dehydration in children.[20] However, metoclopramide and ondasterone may be effective in children.[21] Drought relief Dehydration is the primary treatment for both children and adults, i.e. replenishing lost water and electrolytes. This is preferably made possible by treating the patient with oral desiccation therapy. However, intravenous administration may also be necessary if the patient's consciousness is impaired or intestinal obstruction is present.[22][23] Refined-starch-based oral rehydration salts (ORS) made from wheat or rice have been shown to be more effective than simple sugar-based ORS products.[24] Sugary drinks such as soft drinks and juices are not recommended for children under five. This is because they can increase diarrhea.[19] If specific ORS is not available or is not palatable, plain water may also be used.[19] Food system After administration of oral desiccation solution, it is recommended that breast-fed infants continue to breastfeed on demand and formula-fed infants resume their formula immediately. Starch-free or low-starch mixes are generally not required.[25] Children on semi-solid or semi-solid foods can continue to eat their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea. Foods high in simple sugars should be avoided. The reason is that the osmotic load can increase gastric emptying. Therefore, soft drinks, fruit juices and other high sugar foods should be avoided.[25] Avoiding food is not recommended. Instead, immediate, normal eating habits are encouraged.[26] The BRAT diet (i.e. bananas, rice, apple juice, oatmeal) is not currently recommended. The reason is that it lacks sufficient nutrients and does not provide any more benefits than regular food.[27] Medicines Antiemetics Antiemetics may be helpful in children who are vomiting. A single dose of ondestrone has been associated with a lower number of intravenous fluids, hospital admissions, and vomiting.[28][29][30] Metoclopramide may also be effective.[31] Microbial-reactive substances Antimicrobial agents are not commonly used for gastroenteritis. However, they are sometimes used if symptoms are more severe (such as abdominal pain[32]) or if a microbe is isolated or suspected as the cause.[33] If a decision is made to administer an antimicrobial agent, a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide is often used.[12] Colitis, usually caused by microbial agents, is managed by discontinuing the causative drug and treating with metronidazole or vancomycin.[12][13] Anti-Motion Processors Conceptually, problems can develop with anti-kinetic drugs. However, clinical experience does not point to such phenomena.[6][12] They are not given to people with bloody diarrhea or feverish diarrhea.[1] Lopermide, an opiate synonym, is a symptom-based medication for diarrhea.[12] It is not recommended in children as it may cause toxicity beyond the brain's immature blood barrier. Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), an insoluble compound in aqueous solutions of trivalent bismuth and salicylates, may be used in moderate-to-moderate cases.[6][12] Alternative medicine Bio-support materials Certain types of biologics have been shown to be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of various forms of gastroenteritis.[27] Dairy products that have undergone fermentation (such as curds) also reduce the duration of symptoms.[34] Zinc The World Health Organization recommends that children and infants receive supplemental zinc for up to two weeks after the onset of gastroenteritis.[35] However, a 2009 trial found no benefit from such supplementation.[36] problems Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea. It can be worsened by not drinking water or consuming fruit juice/beverages.[37] It can be caused by improper consumption of starch, a sugar found mainly in milk. Breast-feeding should not be discontinued despite increased diarrhea[38]. Epidemiology  Each year, rototoxins cause 11 million cases of gastroenteritis and approximately half a million deaths in children under the age of five. 82 percent of these occur in the world's poorest countries.[39] In 1980, 4.6 million children died of gastroenteritis from various causes. Most of these occurred in the Third World.[13] Lack of adequate safe water and wastewater treatment contributes to the spread of gastroenteritis. Death rates have now fallen dramatically, falling to around 1.5 million per year in 2000. This is mainly due to the introduction of oral desiccation therapy worldwide.[40] In developed countries the incidence is 1-2.5 per child per year. It is also the primary reason for hospitalization of children of this age. Age, living environment, hygiene and cultural customs are important factors. The causative agents of the disease vary with the climate. Also, the majority of cases of gastroenteritis occur in cold seasons, temperate climates, and summer in tropical regions.[13] History The term ""gastroenteritis"" was not in common use before the 20th century. What is now diagnosed as gastrointestinal disease was, in those days, more specifically known as enteric fever, or ""cholera mobus"" or, less commonly, as ""intestinal stricture"", ""stomach condition"", ""colic"", ""colic"", ""anal problem"".[ 41] Historians, genealogists and other researchers should consider that gastroenteritis was not recognized as a specific disease until recently. United States President Zachary Taylor died of gastroenteritis on Monday, July 9, 1850.[42] Notes  External links    CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link)       Category:Inflammation Category:Citation Slippages - Google Translate Category: Abdominal diseases Category:Google Tamilize medical articles ",What type of disease is stomach flu?,Infection,437

"Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) is a plant species that grows in tropical areas such as India and Sri Lanka. It depends on the plant species. It has herbal medicinal properties. It is a plant that originated in East Asia. It is also known as Chinese rose[1]. It is the national flower of Malaysia. It is commonly grown as an ornamental plant. In Ayurveda it is also known as Japa Pushpa, Rudra Pushpa, Rakta Karphasa. Genetic reproduction This plant does not reproduce by seeds. Easily propagated by stem cuttings. Rosa-sinensis, like most other species, has more than one complete set of chromosomes, a genetic trait known as polymorphism, one of many plant species. A side effect of the multilocus nature is that the phenotype of the offspring allows for a possible random expression of all (or any) of the characteristics of all generations that have gone before, the parent, or indeed any ancestor in a state that is different. With this characteristic, H. rosa-sinensis has created new named varieties, resulting in many new seedlings and often displaying bright individual flowers and held in judging competitions, passed hobby and recross varieties are popular. To add to the genetic possibilities, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis has successfully produced cold-hardy hybrids (see Cold, Hardy Hibiscus cultivars), cold-resistant Hibiscus moscheutos and many other North American Hibiscus cultivars. A plant is a hybrid of species. Often the offspring of these crosses is sterile, but some are even more complex and fertile, with an almost unlimited chance of increasing the final hibiscus rosa-sinensis varieties. It also attracts the training of these tropical plants all over the world, including the distances in the cold regions. uses  The flowers of this plant are used for hair beauty in many ways. It is also eaten by people in the Pacific Islands. This flower is also used in Chinese medicine. In many parts of India, the flower of this plant is used as a cosmetic, to warm the head and to worship God. Petals of this flower can also be used to polish shoes. In Jamaica, this flower is also used to dissolve the fetus in the stomach. Medicinal properties   Hibiscus flower has many medicinal properties. Its leaves, flowers and roots all have medicinal properties. Heals stomach ulcers and ulcers. (Afflicted people eat 5 or 10 petals of the flower daily to cure ulcers.) Hibiscus is the best medicine for women who are infertile due to uterine damage and women who are infertile in old age. (Grinding the petals of hibiscus flower and mixing it with buttermilk and eating it daily cures the diseases in the uterus very soon. Women who are not fertile will also become fertile.) Reduces menstrual disorders. (If Hibiscus flower is dried in the shade and powdered and brewed as a decoction and consumed, abdominal pain, headaches, fainting etc. during menstruation will be reduced.) Cures whitening. (A decoction of saffron petals and consumed cures blanching. Sales This plant can survive climate changes in cold countries like Russia. Hence it is grown as an ornamental plant in homes. A two meter (meter) grown plant is sold there for $250. Flowers  The flowers are multi-colored and have multi-layered petals. Apart from this, multi-colored flowers can also be produced by crossbreeding.

"Kallanai is the world's oldest dam in Tamil Nadu, India. This is Built on Cauvery. It is very close to Trichy. This dam is located in Thanjavur district. In Trichy, Kaveri river, known as Aganda Kaveri, divides into Kollidam in the north and Kaveri in the south. The bridge was built in this place during the British rule. Thiruvarangam river island lies between Cauvery and Kollidam. From there the Cauvery river branch reaches Kallanai. There the river Cauvery divides into 4 rivers namely Inarau (Kolitam), Cauvery, Vennar and Pudu River. The interior (the interior) merges back into the interior. Cauvery has been built like this. During the irrigation season, water is released from the dam into the Cauvery, Vennar and Pudu Rivers and during the flood season into Kollidam. That is, the water coming to Kallani during floods is diverted into the Kollidam River (a tributary of the Mukkompil Cauvery) flowing on the left side of the Cauvery. So lakhs of acres of land in Thanjavur and Nagapattinam districts are protected from floods. History The dam was built by the Chola king Karikalan in the 2nd century.[1][2][3][4] It is known that Kallanai is the oldest of the existing dams and is still in use. It is said to be the oldest irrigation scheme in the world. Palandamizhar's technology of building a stone foundation on sand is still hailed as a dramatic achievement.[5] The length of the tomb is 1080 feet width 66 feet height 18 feet. It is seen with a convoluted structure. It is a miracle that a structure made up of only stone and clay has held back the Cauvery flood for more than 1900 years. A bridge was built over the dam in 1839. It is also a tourist spot as a large number of people come from many places to see this lake every day. Dam construction technology  Centuries ago, the ruler of Tamil Nadu, Karikala Cholan, saw frequent floods in the Cauvery and decided to build a large dam on the Cauvery to stop it. The Tamils ​​also found a way to dam the Cauvery, which flows two lakh cubic meters of water per second. They brought huge rocks on the river Cauvery. Those rocks also went into the soil little by little due to water erosion. They put another rock on top of it and in the middle they spread a kind of sticky clay soil that does not dissolve in water on the new rocks to make the two stick together. This is the technology used to build this bridge. Contribution of Sir Arthur Cotton An English engineer named Sir Arthur Cotton, known as the father of Indian irrigation, explored the quarry for many years. For a long time, Kallana became a sand hill and the flow of water was blocked. Combined Tanjore district has suffered from successive floods and droughts. In this context, in 1829, Sir Arthur Cotton was appointed by the British government as the sole administrator of the Cauvery irrigation area. He was the one who bravely divided the useless stone into small parts and built sand channels. Then, examining the foundation laid for Kallanai, he showed the world the ability of Palantamizhar to build dams and manage irrigation. He also named Kallanai as Grand Amgat.[6] Engineering study of the dam For the first time this paper reports on a detailed engineering study and laboratory simulation of ancient texts and inscriptions carried out by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi). The study was based on archival search, field surveys, direct land surveying and streamflow data. An argument has been made that the oddly shaped stone embankment was designed to increase the flow of silt into the tributary, instead of depositing it in the dam. Cauvery is the main river for irrigation in the region. By 1800 AD alone, it was irrigating 6 lakh acres. The main function of the dyke is to hold back the Cauvery water from the deep and fast-flowing reservoir during normal times. But if there is a flood, it is also a way to safely divert it from the Cauvery to the sea. The stone had been performing this function for about two thousand years without the help of any other structure near it. British engineers made many changes without fully understanding the original plan. They have been struggling with the problem of silt for decades. An English engineer writes (Baird Smith, 1856); ""For nearly 25 years there was a constant struggle with silt. People were removed from many parts of the river. Long banks were built at great cost. However, all efforts were in vain. The river bed continued to rise."" An inscription made in 1776 shows the tombstone before the alterations in good time. This post mentions the peculiar characteristics of the dam. The stone was seen with two or three arches from one end to the other. Its crest was sloping rather than level – the western end being higher than the eastern end. It also sloped across - in some parts it was a regular and even slope, in others an irregular 3 or 4 steps. Finally, the embankment was coated with smooth lime mortar to a thickness of about ¾ inch. This coating usually needs to be replaced at least once every five years. Also, the front was grossly unbalanced. But it is said that this would have been the most advantageous. Because the silt was continuously liquefied and protected from eroding the front wall of the dam.

"Currency is a ""unit of exchange"" for exchanging goods and services. Since money is a medium of exchange and something that holds value in itself, currency is also a form of money. Currency comes in two forms, paper currency and metal coin (coins). For the most part each country has a monopoly on the production and supply of its own currency. Thus currency exchange rates exist to facilitate trade between countries with different currencies. These ratios help us decide what value a particular currency has against other currencies. Currencies are classified into two depending on the currency exchange rate system they use. They are floating currencies and fixed currencies. Countries that have controls over their currencies do so through central banks or finance ministries. History of Ancient Tamil Coins Coins used by royal heirs The coins used by various royal heirs in Tamil Nadu were made of gold, silver and copper. Such coins were called Akkam, Matai, Kalanju, Daily Nakkasu, Karungasu, Eekhakasu. In Tamil literature It can be known through the literature and through the books of the river that the kings of Tamil Nadu supported poets and poets. Thus the poets and poets were given gifts by the kings when they congratulated the king. Gold coins are also given along with the gift items. [1] Sangam Period Coins have been found in various forms at various stages since the Sangam period. Coins issued during the reign of Sangam kings were found with images of tiger, elephant etc. In these coins kalanju was used as a token during the Sangam period. Coins issued during the reign of Sangam kings were found with images of tiger, elephant etc. Inscriptions tell us that in later times kalanju, the size of coins, was used. Roman coins have been found in excavations in Tamil Nadu as evidence of trade between Rome and Tamil Nadu during the Sangam period. [2]. Some of the coins found in Tamil Nadu have been found with Brahmi characters Thinnan and Kakat Senthan. It bears the Sangam period names of Dinnan and Sendan. Sendan is mentioned in the Agananhundu song[1]. form The square issued coins were engraved with motifs such as tree (daru), elephant, thirumaru (srivatsam). Ikasu was presented as Purana in North India and Kanam in South India. [1] History of World Currencies Early coins  BC The currency evolved from two fundamental discoveries that took place in 2000. Money was first found as a receipt in ancient Mesopotamia, Sumeria, and later in ancient Egypt, representing grain stored in temple complexes. In the first phase of currency, metals were used as symbols to represent values ​​stored in the form of commodities. It formed the foundation of a flourishing trade that flourished for over 1500 years. However, the recent collapse of the Eastern Trading System pointed to a flaw: in a period where there was no safe place to store value, the value of circulating media would be positioned as the forces that protected that store. Trade could only go as far as the reliability of those military forces. During the Late Bronze Age, several agreements were made to ensure the protection of merchants throughout the Eastern Mediterranean (countries east of the Mediterranean Sea). They ranged from places like Minoan, Crete and Mycenae in the northwest, to places like Elam and Bakurain in the southeast. Although it is not known what type of coins were used in these trade exchanges, it is thought that they may have been copper coins called ingots, produced in Cyprus, similar in texture to the skin of an animal such as an ox. An increase in raids related to sea piracy, and the collapse of the Bronze Age, are believed to have ended the ingot coinage system. The Phoenician trade of the 10th and 9th centuries BC brought back metal coins and prosperity. This was followed by Greek and then Persian coinage. In Africa, many forms of value have been used as currency, including beads, ingots, ivory, various types of weapons, cattle, Manila coins, and ocher and other earth oxides. From the 15th century onwards, West African manila rings were among the coins used in the sale of slaves. African coins still exist in its various forms. In some parts of the world the barter system is still practiced in some places[3]. Coinage During this period, metal (first silver, then simultaneously silver and gold, and at one time bronze) was the currency of value. Now we have copper metal and precious metals as currencies. The metal is cut, weighed, and stamped into coins. The individual taking the coin must ensure that he is getting a certain weight of precious metal. To avoid the creation of counterfeit coins, they developed the mechanism. This helped in the formation of banking systems. Archimedes' philosophy developed the next method. Coins can now be assayed more easily by measuring the metal. Thus, even if some changes have been made to the currency, their true value can be determined. Many of the largest economies that used currency had coins made of various metals such as copper, silver, and gold. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payments for military and state activities, etc. They are often used as measures of account rather than substance. Silver coins were used for medium exchanges and as a unit of account for taxes, fees, contracts and revenue. Coins made of copper, silver, or other alloys were used for daily transactions. This system was used in ancient India from the time of the Mahajanabads. The exact ratio in value of the three metals varied at different times and in different places. For example, as silver increased in the New World after the Spanish conquest, silver's value decreased when silver mines were opened in the Harz Mountains of central Europe and more silver was obtained. However, the value of rare gold continued to exceed that of silver, and silver continued to exceed that of copper. Paper money  In pre-modern China, credit, a less complicated medium of exchange than the large number of copper coins, led to the introduction of paper money, e.g. bank note Their introduction gradually lasted from the late Tang Dynasty (618-907) to the Song Dynasty (960-1279). The system was initiated by guaranteed notes issued by wholesalers in exchange for merchants' deposits of excess metal coins. These papers are valid for temporary use in a small local area. In the 10th century, the Song dynasty began circulating such papers among merchants in its proprietary salt industry. The Song government granted several outlets the right to publish such papers. Later, in the early 12th century, the Song government took over the stores themselves and created state-issued currency. But such papers were only valid and temporary. By the middle of the 13th century, paper money, a stable and consistent government bond, had become nationally acceptable currency. By the early 11th century, woodblock printing, which was already a widespread method, and later Sheng's movement type printing, helped to make paper money widely produced in pre-modern China.  Meanwhile, in the medieval Islamic world, in the 7th–12th centuries, an intensive monetary economy developed based on the expansion of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Deposit[4], Cheque, Certified Paper[5], Savings Accounts, Exchange Accounts, Trust, Currency Exchange Rate, Lending, Deposit and Credit Exchanges[6], Banking Institutions for Deposits and Loans[6] Islamic Economists, Merchants, Merchants Introduced by In Europe, paper money was first introduced in an orderly fashion in Sweden in 1661. However, paper money had already been recorded as an emergency use by Washington Irving during the siege of Spain and the conquest of Grenada. Because Sweden was rich in copper, its low value necessitated the creation of unusually large coins (weighing several kilograms). The advantages of paper currency were numerous: the need to carry gold and silver was reduced; Gold or silver allowed loans to be charged at interest because it allowed a portion of the currency to enter into forms of credit and exclusive support unless the instrument (gold or silver) was redeemed by the borrower from someone else. It facilitated the sale of shares in joint-stock companies, and the redemption of those shares on paper. Tenure of bank notes A banknote (commonly called a bill in the United States and Canada) is a type of currency commonly used as a legal contract in many jurisdictions. Along with coins, banknotes also form a form of money. Bank accounts are mostly paper, but in 1988, Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Institute developed the world's first polymer currency, increasing the lifespan of polymer coins and preventing counterfeiting.

"Radium is a radioactive element with the atomic formula Ra. Its atomic number is 88. Its atomic mass is 226. Radium is the sixth element in column 2 of the periodic table. It is also classified as an alkaline metal. Pure radium is white in color like silver. But when exposed to air, radium readily reacts with nitrogen instead of oxygen to form a black surface layer called radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive. Among these, the most stable isotope is radium-226. Its half-life is 1600 years. This isotope decays radioactively into radon gas, specifically the isotope radon-222. Ionizing radiation is a byproduct when radium decays. It oxidizes the luminescent chemicals and produces radioluminescence. Radium in the form of radium chloride was discovered in 1898 by Maricuri and Pierrecuri. Radium was isolated from the mineral uranite at the French Academy of Sciences and published five days later. Marie Curie and Anne-Louis DePierre produced radium in its metallic state in 1911 by electrolysis of radium chloride.[1] In nature, radium is found in trace amounts in the minerals uranium and thorium. Radium is not an essential requirement for living organisms. Due to its radioactive and chemical reactivity, adverse health effects may occur when combined with biochemical processes. Radium has no commercial uses other than nuclear medicine. Earlier it was used as a radiation source for radiation devices. It is also considered a decongestant and has been used in radiopharmaceuticals. Radium is not used for such applications today. Because the toxicity of radium is realized today. So less toxic isotopes are used in these devices. Properties Radium is the heaviest of the known alkaline earth metals. And it is the only radioactive metal in that group. The physical and chemical properties of radium are similar to those of the element barium. Pure radium is a volatile element. It is white like silver, although calcium, isudrontium, and barium, which are considered to be its light co-elements, have a slight yellow tint. Its color fades quickly in air. Radium nitride reacts with air to form a black film on its surface. The melting point of radium can be either 700°C or 960°C. And its boiling point is 1737 degrees Celsius. Both of these quantities are smaller than barium. These quantities are also subject to periodic trends in the periodic table[2]. The elements of Group 2 show the same trend as we go from top to bottom of the table. Like barium and the alkali metals, radium crystallizes in a material-centered cubic form at normal temperature and pressure. The bond distance of a radium-radium bond is 514.8 picometres. Its density is 5.5 g/cm3. This is greater than the density of barium. The radium-barium density ratio is comparable to the radium-barium atomic mass ratio. Because both elements crystallize in the same crystal structure. Isotopes Radium has 33 isotopes with mass numbers ranging from 202 to 234. All these are radioactive. 223Ra with a half-life of 11.4 days, 224Ra with a half-life of 3.64 days, 226Ra with a half-life of 1600 years, and 228Ra with a half-life of 5.75 years are all from the decay chain of isotopes thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 Looks natural. The isotope 223Ra originates from the isotope uranium-235, the isotope 226Ra from the isotope uranium-235, and the other two isotopes from the isotope thorium 232.

"A sea or ocean, world ocean, or simply ocean is a connected body of salt water that covers 70 percent of the Earth's surface. It stabilizes the Earth's climate and plays a primary role in the water cycle, organic cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although sea voyages and explorations have been conducted since ancient times, science-based oceanography or oceanography largely dates back to James Cook's discovery and exploration of the Pacific Ocean between 1768 and 1779. The word sea is also used to refer to small, partially landlocked parts of the ocean. Aazhi, viri neer, perun neer, paru neer etc. are also indicated. The most abundant dissolved solid in seawater is sodium chloride (common salt). Also, this water contains salts like magnesium, calcium, potassium and many other elements. Some of these are found in low concentrations. Salinity varies greatly from place to place. Salinity is less near the shore and in the estuary (where the river meets the sea) and deep sea. However, the ""analog"" rates of dissolved salts in the oceans generally remain the same; Not much changes. Waves are created by wind blowing over the ocean surface. When they reach shallow water, they break up and disperse with turbulence. Surface currents are formed by the friction of the blowing air. This causes a slow but steady current across the oceans. The directions of these currents are determined by factors such as the shape of the continents and the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect). Deep ocean currents, known as the global convective belt, carry cold water from the nearby poles to all oceans. Othams rise and fall from sea level twice daily. These fluctuations are caused by the rotation of the Earth, the gravitational pull of the Moon orbiting the Earth, and to a lesser extent the Sun. The chanterelles are most abundant in bays or estuaries. Destructive landslides are caused by undersea earthquakes. These earthquakes are caused by undersea tectonic movements, volcanic eruptions, large landslides, or large meteorites. Viruses, bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi and animals live in the ocean. These organisms range from sunlit surface waters to sunless, high-pressure, cold, and dark deep waters. The nature of the ocean also changes along the latitude. For example, the ocean contains cold water beneath arctic ice and colorful coral reefs in tropical regions. Many major groups of organisms evolved in the ocean. Also, life may have originated in the sea itself. The ocean provides a significant amount of food for people. These primarily include fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seaweed, etc. Seaweeds are available harvested in the wild or grown underwater. The ocean is used for commerce, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming, surfing, sailing, and scuba diving. Oceans are greatly affected by pollution. Throughout history the sea has greatly aided many cultures. The sea has also been a primary element in literature such as Omar's Odyssey. It has played a major role in maritime painting, theatre, and ancient music. definition  An ocean is a system that includes all of Earth's ocean waters. The system includes five known ""oceans"", the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Antarctic Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.[1] The term ""ocean"" is used to refer specifically to areas containing a small amount of seawater. ie Red Sea, Black Sea etc. Other words referring to the sea In Tamil, sea is Aralai, Ari, Alai, Aluva, Alam, Alakar, Argali, Alantai, Azhi, Endunir, Uravunir, Uvar, Uvari, Uva, Odham, Odhavanam, Olam, Kayam, Kali, Karkol, Kitangar, Gundunir, Kuravai, Chakram, Chaladaram, Chalanithi, Chalarasi, Chalati, Chuli, Thazhi, Thira, Sathya, Tendrai, Seriesal, Thonneer, Thomham, Naralai, Staanneer, Neetam, Swim, Neerakam, Nirathi, Neerazhi, Neduneer, Normaneer, Parappu, Paravai, Paru, Pari, Sea is referred to in Tamil by many words such as Bazhi, Panal, Prambu, Punarpu, Punari, Peruneer, Bauvam, Malu, Munneer, Vaari, Valayam, Valanier, Wari, Wariti, Veerai, Vendrai, Vezhalhi, Vara.[2][3] Physics of the Ocean  Earth is the only planet in the Solar System that has water on its surface in the aqueous (liquid) state.[4](p22) However, Earth-like planets outside the Solar System are believed to have oceans.[5] More than 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered by ocean water. [4] (p7) 97.2 percent of Earth's water is found in oceans. This is equivalent to approximately 1,360,000,000 cubic kilometers (330,000,000cumi).[6] The remaining 2.15 percent of water is contained in glaciers and sea ice. About 0.65 percent of water is in water vapor, other freshwater lakes, rivers, groundwater, and air.[6] Seen from space, our planet looks like a blue sphere.[7] Fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke said that since the sea is a dominant feature of our planet, we can call it ""Ocean"" instead of ""Earth"".[4](p7) Physical oceanography or ocean physics is the study of the physical properties of the ocean such as temperature-salinity structure, mixing, waves, internal currents, and surface currents. The study of internal currents and circulations.[4](pp14–17)[8] The movement of water in the form of currents, currents, and waves is responsible for climate change in coastal areas.[9] Oceanography is the study of the shape and extent of ocean drainages, and the landmasses that terminate in the ocean. The shape of the ocean basin and its extension help to determine what the Earth's materials are made of. Also, through these, we can learn about continental movement, earthquake prone areas, volcanic activity, and how sedimentary rocks were formed through sedimentary materials.[9] sea ​​water  The water in the oceans was thought to have formed from material ejected from rocks melted by Earth's volcanoes 4 billion years ago.[4](pp24–25) However, recent studies suggest that Earth's water may have come from meteorites.[10] Oceans contain salt water. Seawater is salty because salt minerals move from the land to the sea via rivers. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere mixes with rainwater and becomes slightly acidic, then mountain water turns into rivers, mixes with various minerals such as salt in mountain rocks and soil, and finally mixes with the sea, making sea water too salty to drink. Also, undersea volcanoes spewing steam, volcanic eruptions, and salt minerals in the subsurface mix with the ocean, causing seawater to become salty.[11] This makes the sea water salty. Salinity is usually measured in parts per thousand (parts per thousand - denoted by the symbol ‰ or ""/million""). An open ocean contains 35 grams of solids per liter of water. It is referred to as 35‰. (90% of ocean water has a salinity of 34‰ to 35‰[12]). The Mediterranean Sea is slightly higher at 37‰. 85% of common salt, sodium and chloride are present in that water. Also dissolved in it are the metal ions of magnesium and calcium and the counter ions of sulfate, carbonate, bromide etc. Although different salinities are observed in different oceans, the relative distribution remains constant throughout the world.[13][14] Sea water is very dangerous for human kidneys. They cannot purify the excess salt in it.[15] However, some hypersaline lakes, for example the Dead Sea, contain 300 grams of dissolved solids per liter (ie 300‰).  The salinity of the ocean changes due to evaporation rate of surface water (increased by high temperature, wind speed, wave motion), precipitation capacity, melting or freezing of sea ice, glacier melting, inflow of fresh river water, mixing of water bodies of different salinity. For example, the low volatility of the Baltic Sea's cold climate, mixing by many rivers, and the frequent inflow of cold water from the North Sea make the bottom layer thicker and unable to mix with its overlying layers. So the salinity of the upper layer is only 10 to 15‰. and even less in its estuarine regions.[16] The warm Red Sea has maximum evaporation but low precipitation; Some rivers also flow into it. Also, Bab-el-Mandeb, where it merges with Adam's Gulf, is very narrow. Hence its average salinity is around 40 ‰.[17] The temperature of the ocean depends on the amount of sunlight falling on its surface. In tropical regions, when the sun is at the top, the temperature is around 30°C. But in the polar regions the sea temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice. It is always at -2°C. There is a continuous current in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they leave the tropics. As the water cools, its density increases. And so, it goes down. That cold water comes back to the equator due to deep ocean currents. This cycle occurs due to changes in temperature and density. Deep-sea temperatures around the world can range from -2°C to 5°C.[18] Oceans Atlantic Ocean   It is the second largest ocean in the world. Its total area is 106.4 million square kilometers. It covers an average of twenty percent of the Earth's surface. North American and South American continents are located in its western part and Europe and Africa are located in the eastern part. The deepest part of this ocean is Puerto Rico. The average depth of the Atlantic Ocean is 28,232 feet. Its average depth is 10,936 feet. Southern Ocean  . The Antarctic is the ocean that surrounds the landmass. It is a cold sea filled with icebergs. The temperature here ranges from ten degrees Celsius to minus two degrees Celsius. Here the glaciers are floating hundreds of feet below sea level. In March, the area of ​​glaciers is 26 lakh sq km. will be In September, its area decreases to 19.8 lakh sq km. This sea contains the Ross Sea, Amundsen Sea, Weddell Sea and Antarctica Bays and many more bays. The fourth ocean in the world is the Antarctic Ocean. It is sometimes called the Southern Ocean. In 2000, the International Hydrographic Center extended the boundary of this ocean to include the oceans south of 60 degrees south latitude with Antarctica. At present its total area is two crore three lakh twenty seven thousand square km. is A depth of 4,000 to 5,000 meters is found. These areas are rich in oil and natural gas. Sea lions and whales are also found here. Artic Ocean The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's oceans. It lies entirely above the Arctic Circle. Its total area is 14,090,000 sq km. is Its average depth is 3,658 m. Its maximum depth is 4,665 m. is This ocean is completely surrounded by land. The Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia, the Davis Strait between Greenland and Canada, the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Europe, and the Norwegian Sea connect the Arctic Ocean to the outside world. The Arctic Ocean is divided into two parts on the basis of the Earth's crust. They are Eurasian Plate and North American Plate. Between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans their margins are found submerged. Landforms and submerged plates around the Arctic prevent infiltration of outside water. Therefore, the ocean is like a reservoir of cold water. The core of the Arctic Ocean is permanently frozen ten feet deep. During the warmer months, water surrounds the ice cubes and they begin to float. Twice as much ice freezes in the cold months as in the warm months. Artic Ocean is an ocean without waves. It cannot be sailed. It is known to be frozen in winter and floating ice floes in other seasons. It is popularly called an ocean because it covers more than 130 lakh sq km.[19] Indian Ocean  Among the five oceans in the world, the Indian Ocean is the largest ocean after the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. It is bounded by the Southern Ocean to the south, Africa to the west, Asia to the north, and Australia to the east. Its total area is 6,85,56,000 sq km. is The International Hydrographic Center defined the boundaries of the Indian Ocean in the second millennium. Accordingly, the area south of the Indian Ocean below 60 degrees was divided and the boundary of the Southern Ocean (Antarctic) was extended. The deepest part of the Indian Ocean is the Java Strait. Its depth is 7,258 meters. Petroleum products and natural gas are found naturally in abundance in this sea. About 40 percent of the world's production of petroleum products comes from the Indian Ocean. Another natural resource of this sea is the abundant availability of seafood like fish. Fishing vessels from the Indian Ocean countries including Russia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan use it as their fishing base. The Indian Ocean contains important sea lanes. It connects parts of Middle East Africa and East Asia with Europe Pacific Ocean  The largest ocean in the world is the Pacific Ocean. Pacific is Latin for calm sea. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south. It is bordered by Australia and Asia to the west and the Americas to the east. Sixteen crore ninety two lakh sq. km. This sea is located in the area About 62 point 2 crore cubic km. This ocean contains water. The ocean contains 46 percent of the world's water reserves and 30 percent of the world's total surface area. The largest ocean in the world is the Pacific Ocean. It comprises 35.25 percent of the Earth's surface area. Mindanao is the deepest region in the world. Its depth is 11,516 meters. The largest number of islands in the world are in this sea. The deepest ocean in the world is the Mariana Trench in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Its depth is 10,911 meters. The average depth of the Pacific is 4028 to 4188 meters. There are about 25,000 islands in this ocean. Most of the islands are found in the South Pacific. Some of them are submerged in the sea. Most are high islands. Currently, the Pacific Ocean is shrinking due to the movement of the Earth's plate. Instead, the Atlantic Ocean is expanding. On average, it shrinks by half a kilometer per year. Many seas lie along the western border of the Pacific Ocean. They are Celebes Sea, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Sea of ​​Japan, South China Sea, Sulu Sea, Philippine Sea, Tasman Sea and Yellow Sea. is seas Arabian Sea The sea to the west of India is known as the Arabian Sea. It was known as Pachim Samudram in ancient and medieval times. To the east of this sea is India, to the west is Saudi Arabia - Africa, to the north is Iran - Pakistan, and to the south is the Indian Ocean. The widest part of this sea is approximately 2400 km. is In the south, this sea merges with the Indian Ocean, so its southern boundary cannot be determined. Indus, Narmada and Tabati rivers flow into this sea. The Gulf of Oman connects it with the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Aden connects it with the Red Sea. On the shores of this sea are located major ports like Aden, Karachi, Bombay, Kochi and many famous cities. Aral Sea Aral sea (Aral sea) is 240 km east of the Caspian sea in Turkistan region. Farther is the largest saltwater lake. This lake is the largest inland body of water in the world. Its total area is 66,459 sq km. is It ranges from 17 to 68 meters deep. There are many islands in the Aral Sea. Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers flow into this sea. Ionian Sea The Ionian Sea is the deepest part of the Mediterranean Sea. This sea separates Italy - Sicily and Albania - Greece. The Strait of Otranto connects this sea with the Adriatic Sea. The width of this sea is 676 km. is In some areas the depth of this sea is 5093 meters. Inland Sea The Inland Sea is located like a canal in the Pacific Ocean in Japan. It is located in southern Japan between the islands of Hankook and Kyushu. There are more than 950 islands in this shallow sea. Its total length is 9505 km. is It is connected to the Sea of ​​Japan by a narrow channel. Population density on the coasts of inland seas. This sea is famous for its natural beauty. Bay of Bengal  The eastern border of India is the Bay of Bengal. It is 21 lakh 73 thousand square km. has an area of This sea is located to the north-east of the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by India and Sri Lanka to the west. The Bay of Bengal is bounded by Bangladesh and Myanmar (Burma) to the north, the peninsula to the east, the southern tip of Sri Lanka to the south, and the sea to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Many important rivers flow west of this sea. They are Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. To the north the Brahmaputra river also flows into this sea. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are the only group of islands located in this sea. Its average depth is 2,600 meters. The maximum depth of this sea is 4,694 meters. Oil and natural gas resources are currently being discovered in the Bay of Bengal. The sea is rich in mineral rich soil. Coastal countries and Japan are engaged in fishing because of the abundance of fish resources here. This sea contains many economically important sea lanes.

Many major groups of organisms evolved in the ocean. Also, life may have originated in the sea itself. The ocean provides a significant amount of food for people. These primarily include fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seaweed, etc. Seaweeds are available harvested in the wild or grown underwater. The ocean is used for commerce, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming, surfing, sailing, and scuba diving. Oceans are greatly affected by pollution. Throughout history the sea has greatly aided many cultures. The sea has also been a primary element in literature such as Omar's Odyssey. It has played a major role in maritime painting, theatre, and ancient music. definition  An ocean is a system that includes all of Earth's ocean waters. The system includes five known ""oceans"", the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Antarctic Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.[1] The term ""ocean"" is used to refer specifically to areas containing a small amount of seawater. ie Red Sea, Black Sea etc. Other words referring to the sea In Tamil, sea is Aralai, Ari, Alai, Aluva, Alam, Alakar, Argali, Alantai, Azhi, Endunir, Uravunir, Uvar, Uvari, Uva, Odham, Odhavanam, Olam, Kayam, Kali, Karkol, Kitangar, Gundunir, Kuravai, Chakram, Chaladaram, Chalanithi, Chalarasi, Chalati, Chuli, Thazhi, Thira, Sathya, Tendrai, Seriesal, Thonneer, Thomham, Naralai, Staanneer, Neetam, Swim, Neerakam, Nirathi, Neerazhi, Neduneer, Normaneer, Parappu, Paravai, Paru, Pari, Sea is referred to in Tamil by many words such as Bazhi, Panal, Prambu, Punarpu, Punari, Peruneer, Bauvam, Malu, Munneer, Vaari, Valayam, Valanier, Wari, Wariti, Veerai, Vendrai, Vezhalhi, Vara.[2][3] Physics of the Ocean  Earth is the only planet in the Solar System that has water on its surface in the aqueous (liquid) state.[4](p22) However, Earth-like planets outside the Solar System are believed to have oceans.[5] More than 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered by ocean water. [4] (p7) 97.2 percent of Earth's water is found in oceans. This is equivalent to approximately 1,360,000,000 cubic kilometers (330,000,000cumi).[6] The remaining 2.15 percent of water is contained in glaciers and sea ice. About 0.65 percent of water is in water vapor, other freshwater lakes, rivers, groundwater, and air.[6] Seen from space, our planet looks like a blue sphere.[7] Fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke said that since the sea is a dominant feature of our planet, we can call it ""Ocean"" instead of ""Earth"".[4](p7) Physical oceanography or ocean physics is the study of the physical properties of the ocean such as temperature-salinity structure, mixing, waves, internal currents, and surface currents. The study of internal currents and circulations.[4](pp14–17)[8] The movement of water in the form of currents, currents, and waves is responsible for climate change in coastal areas.[9] Oceanography is the study of the shape and extent of ocean drainages, and the landmasses that terminate in the ocean. The shape of the ocean basin and its extension help to determine what the Earth's materials are made of. Also, through these, we can learn about continental movement, earthquake prone areas, volcanic activity, and how sedimentary rocks were formed through sedimentary materials.[9] sea ​​water  The water in the oceans was thought to have formed from material ejected from rocks melted by Earth's volcanoes 4 billion years ago.[4](pp24–25) However, recent studies suggest that Earth's water may have come from meteorites.[10] Oceans contain salt water. Seawater is salty because salt minerals move from the land to the sea via rivers. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere mixes with rainwater and becomes slightly acidic, then mountain water turns into rivers, mixes with various minerals such as salt in mountain rocks and soil, and finally mixes with the sea, making sea water too salty to drink. Also, undersea volcanoes spewing steam, volcanic eruptions, and salt minerals in the subsurface mix with the ocean, causing seawater to become salty.[11] This makes the sea water salty. Salinity is usually measured in parts per thousand (parts per thousand - denoted by the symbol ‰ or ""/million""). An open ocean contains 35 grams of solids per liter of water. It is referred to as 35‰. (90% of ocean water has a salinity of 34‰ to 35‰[12]). The Mediterranean Sea is slightly higher at 37‰. 85% of common salt, sodium and chloride are present in that water. Also dissolved in it are the metal ions of magnesium and calcium and the counter ions of sulfate, carbonate, bromide etc. Although different salinities are observed in different oceans, the relative distribution remains constant throughout the world.[13][14] Sea water is very dangerous for human kidneys. They cannot purify the excess salt in it.[15] However, some hypersaline lakes, for example the Dead Sea, contain 300 grams of dissolved solids per liter (ie 300‰).  The salinity of the ocean changes due to evaporation rate of surface water (increased by high temperature, wind speed, wave motion), precipitation capacity, melting or freezing of sea ice, glacier melting, inflow of fresh river water, mixing of water bodies of different salinity. For example, the low volatility of the Baltic Sea's cold climate, mixing by many rivers, and the frequent inflow of cold water from the North Sea make the bottom layer thicker and unable to mix with its overlying layers. So the salinity of the upper layer is only 10 to 15‰. and even less in its estuarine regions.[16] The warm Red Sea has maximum evaporation but low precipitation; Some rivers also flow into it. Also, Bab-el-Mandeb, where it merges with Adam's Gulf, is very narrow. Hence its average salinity is around 40 ‰.[17] The temperature of the ocean depends on the amount of sunlight falling on its surface. In tropical regions, when the sun is at the top, the temperature is around 30°C. But in the polar regions the sea temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice. It is always at -2°C. There is a continuous current in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they leave the tropics. As the water cools, its density increases. And so, it goes down. That cold water comes back to the equator due to deep ocean currents. This cycle occurs due to changes in temperature and density. Deep-sea temperatures around the world can range from -2°C to 5°C.[18] Oceans Atlantic Ocean   It is the second largest ocean in the world. Its total area is 106.4 million square kilometers. It covers an average of twenty percent of the Earth's surface. North American and South American continents are located in its western part and Europe and Africa are located in the eastern part. The deepest part of this ocean is Puerto Rico. The average depth of the Atlantic Ocean is 28,232 feet. Its average depth is 10,936 feet. Southern Ocean  . The Antarctic is the ocean that surrounds the landmass. It is a cold sea filled with icebergs. The temperature here ranges from ten degrees Celsius to minus two degrees Celsius. Here the glaciers are floating hundreds of feet below sea level. In March, the area of ​​glaciers is 26 lakh sq km. will be In September, its area decreases to 19.8 lakh sq km. This sea contains the Ross Sea, Amundsen Sea, Weddell Sea and Antarctica Bays and many more bays. The fourth ocean in the world is the Antarctic Ocean. It is sometimes called the Southern Ocean. In 2000, the International Hydrographic Center extended the boundary of this ocean to include the oceans south of 60 degrees south latitude with Antarctica. At present its total area is two crore three lakh twenty seven thousand square km. is A depth of 4,000 to 5,000 meters is found. These areas are rich in oil and natural gas. Sea lions and whales are also found here. Artic Ocean The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's oceans. It lies entirely above the Arctic Circle. Its total area is 14,090,000 sq km. is Its average depth is 3,658 m. Its maximum depth is 4,665 m. is This ocean is completely surrounded by land. The Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia, the Davis Strait between Greenland and Canada, the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Europe, and the Norwegian Sea connect the Arctic Ocean to the outside world. The Arctic Ocean is divided into two parts on the basis of the Earth's crust. They are Eurasian Plate and North American Plate. Between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans their margins are found submerged. Landforms and submerged plates around the Arctic prevent infiltration of outside water. Therefore, the ocean is like a reservoir of cold water. The core of the Arctic Ocean is permanently frozen ten feet deep. During the warmer months, water surrounds the ice cubes and they begin to float. Twice as much ice freezes in the cold months as in the warm months. Artic Ocean is an ocean without waves. It cannot be sailed. It is known to be frozen in winter and floating ice floes in other seasons. It is popularly called an ocean because it covers more than 130 lakh sq km.[19] Indian Ocean  Among the five oceans in the world, the Indian Ocean is the largest ocean after the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. It is bounded by the Southern Ocean to the south, Africa to the west, Asia to the north, and Australia to the east. Its total area is 6,85,56,000 sq km. is The International Hydrographic Center defined the boundaries of the Indian Ocean in the second millennium. Accordingly, the area south of the Indian Ocean below 60 degrees was divided and the boundary of the Southern Ocean (Antarctic) was extended. The deepest part of the Indian Ocean is the Java Strait. Its depth is 7,258 meters. Petroleum products and natural gas are found naturally in abundance in this sea. About 40 percent of the world's production of petroleum products comes from the Indian Ocean. Another natural resource of this sea is the abundant availability of seafood like fish. Fishing vessels from the Indian Ocean countries including Russia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan use it as their fishing base. The Indian Ocean contains important sea lanes. It connects parts of Middle East Africa and East Asia with Europe Pacific Ocean  The largest ocean in the world is the Pacific Ocean. Pacific is Latin for calm sea. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south. It is bordered by Australia and Asia to the west and the Americas to the east. Sixteen crore ninety two lakh sq. km. This sea is located in the area About 62 point 2 crore cubic km. This ocean contains water. The ocean contains 46 percent of the world's water reserves and 30 percent of the world's total surface area. The largest ocean in the world is the Pacific Ocean. It comprises 35.25 percent of the Earth's surface area. Mindanao is the deepest region in the world. Its depth is 11,516 meters. The largest number of islands in the world are in this sea. The deepest ocean in the world is the Mariana Trench in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Its depth is 10,911 meters. The average depth of the Pacific is 4028 to 4188 meters. There are about 25,000 islands in this ocean. Most of the islands are found in the South Pacific. Some of them are submerged in the sea. Most are high islands. Currently, the Pacific Ocean is shrinking due to the movement of the Earth's plate. Instead, the Atlantic Ocean is expanding. On average, it shrinks by half a kilometer per year. Many seas lie along the western border of the Pacific Ocean. They are Celebes Sea, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Sea of ​​Japan, South China Sea, Sulu Sea, Philippine Sea, Tasman Sea and Yellow Sea. is seas Arabian Sea The sea to the west of India is known as the Arabian Sea. It was known as Pachim Samudram in ancient and medieval times. To the east of this sea is India, to the west is Saudi Arabia - Africa, to the north is Iran - Pakistan, and to the south is the Indian Ocean. The widest part of this sea is approximately 2400 km. is In the south, this sea merges with the Indian Ocean, so its southern boundary cannot be determined. Indus, Narmada and Tabati rivers flow into this sea. The Gulf of Oman connects it with the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Aden connects it with the Red Sea. On the shores of this sea are located major ports like Aden, Karachi, Bombay, Kochi and many famous cities. Aral Sea Aral sea (Aral sea) is 240 km east of the Caspian sea in Turkistan region. Farther is the largest saltwater lake. This lake is the largest inland body of water in the world. Its total area is 66,459 sq km. is It ranges from 17 to 68 meters deep. There are many islands in the Aral Sea. Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers flow into this sea. Ionian Sea The Ionian Sea is the deepest part of the Mediterranean Sea. This sea separates Italy - Sicily and Albania - Greece. The Strait of Otranto connects this sea with the Adriatic Sea. The width of this sea is 676 km. is In some areas the depth of this sea is 5093 meters. Inland Sea The Inland Sea is located like a canal in the Pacific Ocean in Japan. It is located in southern Japan between the islands of Hankook and Kyushu. There are more than 950 islands in this shallow sea. Its total length is 9505 km. is It is connected to the Sea of ​​Japan by a narrow channel. Population density on the coasts of inland seas. This sea is famous for its natural beauty. Bay of Bengal  The eastern border of India is the Bay of Bengal. It is 21 lakh 73 thousand square km. has an area of This sea is located to the north-east of the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by India and Sri Lanka to the west. The Bay of Bengal is bounded by Bangladesh and Myanmar (Burma) to the north, the peninsula to the east, the southern tip of Sri Lanka to the south, and the sea to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Many important rivers flow west of this sea. They are Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. To the north the Brahmaputra river also flows into this sea. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are the only group of islands located in this sea. Its average depth is 2,600 meters. The maximum depth of this sea is 4,694 meters. Oil and natural gas resources are currently being discovered in the Bay of Bengal. The sea is rich in mineral rich soil. Coastal countries and Japan are engaged in fishing because of the abundance of fish resources here. This sea contains many economically important sea lanes. They connect many international ports with the eastern ports of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India. List of oceans by ocean Atlantic Ocean Argentinian Sea Babin's umbrella Sen.

"Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It is also the smallest planet in the solar system. It takes 88 days to go around the Sun once. Seen from Earth it appears to take 116 days. No natural moons are known for it. [lower-alpha 1] This planet is named after the Roman messenger god Mercury in Western culture. Mercury is named after the god of knowledge in Indian culture. Because the angular separation of Mercury from the Sun is low (at most 28.3o), Mercury is rarely seen due to the brightness of the Sun. That is why our sages say that even if you get gold, you will not get Mercury. Morning or evening twilight is the perfect time to see Mercury. Because Mercury lacks an atmosphere to retain heat from the Sun, Mercury's surface experiences greater temperature fluctuations than any other planet; Near the equator it is 700K (427°C; 800°F) during the day and 100K (−173°C; −280°F) at night. It is always colder at the terminals (poles). Mercury's axis has the lowest declination (about 10 degrees) in the Solar System. But its orbital deviation is very high. [lower-alpha 2] It does not have seasons like most other planets. Mercury is 1.5 times as far from the Sun as it is at ecliptic. Mercury orbits the Sun in the most unique way in the Solar System. As seen from the fixed stars, it revolves around itself three times in two revolutions of its orbit.[13] As seen from the Sun, which has an orbital index, it orbits once every two Mercury years. Mercury's Ascendant has one day for two years. Mercury is almost similar in appearance to Earth's moon. It is characterized by many large craters with cuttings. Like Earth, Mercury has no atmosphere. But unlike Earth, Mercury has an iron-rich interior. Due to this, Mercury also has some magnetic field. It must be said that not much is known about Budha. Mariner 10 was the first of two spacecraft to approach Mercury. It approached Mercury in 1974–1975 and mapped 45% of its surface. A second mission, MESSENGER, took another 30% image when it flew by Mercury in January 2008. It again approached Mercury in 2009. Then on March 18, 2011, it was inserted into the orbit of Mercury (orbital insertion) and became a satellite of Mercury. infrastructure   Mercury is one of the four terrestrial planets of the solar system. Like the Earth, it is made of rocks. It is the smallest planet in the solar system. Its equatorial radius is 2,439.7 km.[14] Mercury is approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate.[15] It is the second densest planet in the solar system with a density of 5.427 kg/cm3. It is the density of Earth at 5.515 kg/cm3.[14] A little less than Magnetic field and magnetosphere  Despite its small size and slow 59-day rotation, Mercury has a significant, pervasive, magnetic field. According to measurements taken by Mariner 10, Mercury's magnetic field is 1.1% stronger than Earth's. The magnetic field strength at Mercury's equator is about 300 nanotesla (nT).[16][17] Like Earth, Mercury's magnetic field is dipole.[18] But unlike Earth, Mercury's magnetic poles are closely aligned with the planet's spin axis.[19] The strength and shape of this magnetic field are consistent with measurements from the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER spacecraft.[19] Like Earth, the magnetic field here is also created by the electromagnet effect.[20][21] This electrifying effect is caused by the circulation of the planet's ferrous liquid core. Fluctuations due to the planet's extreme orbital deviation help keep the nucleus in a hydrostatic state.[22] Mercury's strong magnetic field deflects the solar wind around the planet. Due to this, a magnetic field is formed around the planet. It is small enough to capture the solar wind. This causes the surface of the planet to be rubbed by space.[19] Observations by Mariner 10 have detected low-energy plasma in the magnetosphere in the nightside of the planet. Swarms of energetic particles have been detected in the planet's magnetotail; It also shoots the planet's magnetosphere activity.[18] During its second flyby on October 6, 2008, MESSENGER found Mercury's magnetic field very ""leaky"".[23] from earth When viewed from Earth, Mercury is most likely to be visible when it is at its greatest elongation. Physics means that most of it can be seen from Earth (only half of it is illuminated by the sun. When viewed from Earth, only half of the illuminated area can be seen). case. But according to this physical case, most parts of Mercury cannot be clearly seen. The reason for this is the apparent luminosity of Mercury. So Mercury can be seen easily when the cuvex lines are bent. That is, it can be clearly seen by the naked eye of observers a few days before the eastward extension and a few days after the westward extension. Possibilities of Humanity in Mercury Moon like Mercury  From the point of view of moon settlement, the same things are required for moon settlement. Additionally, heat shields are required to escape the heat of the sun. A fixed moving settlement should also be created for this. (See image on the right) The solar energy available here is very high so electricity can be easily obtained. The advantage of this is that you can get six and a half times more electricity here than you can with solar panels on Earth. Water source Mercury has water ice at its poles. These are places without sunlight for billions of years, so they are not evaporating today. The abundant ice found in the deep craters at the north pole of Mercury is thought to be balls of ice that were dropped by stars billions of years ago. Obstacles In this, creating more techniques for the monitor settlement, finding and developing a method of making heat shields for this, and creating high-pressure and high-speed spacecraft to go from this planet to another planet are major obstacles for the monitor settlement on Mercury.

"A fish is a vertebrate animal that lives in water. A fish can be defined as a four-legged invertebrate aquatic organism. The anterior and posterior surfaces of the fish are convex. The body consists of three distinct parts, head, body and tail. These do not have a separate neck. They swim with appendages and dorsal fins. Most fish are exothermic (cold-blooded animals). That means changing its body temperature according to the environment. However, some large animals such as white sharks and tuna are able to withstand high core temperatures.[1][2] These are living creatures that breathe and eat and reproduce in water. Many different types of fish live in both fresh and salt water. The varieties of fish vary greatly in size, color and shape. Water bodies are the habitats of most of the fish. Fish species occupy most aquatic habitats. Some fishes live in shallow ponds, and some species live in deep seas and in light-poor environments. They are found in almost all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., Gare, Gadjan) to low, deep seas (e.g., gulpers (dwarfs, baitfish). About 33,100 fish species, no other They have the greatest diversity among vertebrates.[3] Fisheries play an important role in the global economy as a food source for humans. Most of the world's commercial and livelihood is fishing. And aquaculture for food and beauty has emerged as a huge industry. Fish are kept as pets by anglers and for beauty in public aquariums. Fish is a sacred deity, cultural symbol and religious symbol in various cultures. It has also played an important role in stories, literature, epics, anthropology, history, etc. in various periods. Evolution (a) Sharpness In taxonomy, fish do not represent a single unit because the evolution of fish cannot be considered a single event. Fish are a sharp gateway to vertebrates from vertebrates. They are considered to be the protozoa of vertebrates.[4] Studies in the fossil record suggest that primitive fish were small, armored, and jawless. These are called ostracoderms. But now most of the jawless fish species are extinct. Lampreys are predicted to be the progenitors of jawed fishes. The first jawed fish was derived from the Placodermy fossil. The diversity of jawed vertebrates is thought to have evolved out of their evolutionary need and advantage. The evolution of the fish jaw may have been due to food ingestion, predation, biting power, improved respiration, or a combination of these factors. It is hypothesized that fish may have evolved from a coral-like snake-like creature. Because the population of the fish is similar in appearance to the primitive fish species. The protozoa of fishes may have been similar to algae. Because even today some seaweeds (sea-skirts) look indistinguishable from adult and juvenile ones.      Jawless fishes                Hyperarcia (Lampire fishes) ?†Euconolonda (eel-like fish) unnamed                †Theraspidomorphi (jawless fishes) ?†Tilodonti (jawless teleosts) unnamed            ?†Anaspida (jawless primitive lamprey fishes) unnamed            †Calyspida (jawless teleosts) unnamed                ?†Pituriaspida (jawless fishes with large protuberant carapace) †Osteosteracei (jawless strong-boned fishes) Notostometa → Continuity as follows         Jawfish            †Placodermy (armored fishes) unnamed            Acanthodians and Chondrites (Cartilaginous Fishes)            Actinopterygian ray fishes < Current maximum fish species of this genus are sarcopterygian finfishes.                    ?†Anicodontiformis blackfin fishes Actinistia (Celadon fishes) unnamed            †Porolupiformis blackfin fishes Dipnai (lung breathing fishes) unnamed            †Rhizodontidae (predator fishes)            †Tristicopteridae (quadrupeds) Tetrapoda (chairs) classification The taxonomy of fishes is classified in the parallel monophyletic group, as tetrapods were also classified in the old way. For this reason, the separate class for fish found in older references is not systematically used. Conventional classification divides fish species into three classes, sometimes with extinct species under a taxonomic branch. Sometimes they are even classes of their own: [5][6] Class Agnata (jawless fish) Subclass Cyclostometa (Hackmen, Lampreys) Subclass Ostracotheri (armored jawless fish) † Class Chondrichthyes (short bony fishes) Subclass Elasmobranchii (sharks, anemones) Subclass Holocephali (chimeras, extinct fish species) Class Placodermia (armored fishes) † Class Acanthodea (protosharks, sometimes classified within the bony fishes)†  Class Osteitius (bony fishes) Subclass Actinoterygae (ray-finned fishes) Subclass Charopterygii (fleshy blackfishes, progenitors of chairfish) The classifications mentioned above are generally taken as superficial groupings without precision. It includes Agnathans as prefixes to Chondrichtheus. These were both acanthodeans and precursors of Asteitheus. These are further classified in a new classification module. They are as follows: Class Mixini (hake fishes) Class Theraspidomorphi † (earlier jawless fishes) Class Thelodonti † Class Anaspita † Class Hyperoarcia Petromysontidae (Lumbery fishes) Class Conodonta †Order Class Cephallospidomorphi † (earlier jawless fishes) (ungraded) Galespita † (Ungraded) Pituriaspida † (Ungraded) Ostreosteaceae † Intrapod Nothostomeda (jawed vertebrates) Class Placodermia † (armored fishes) Class Chondrichthyes (Cartilaginous fish (shark) Class Acanthodeae † (Murthora) Superclass Osteidae (bony fishes) Class Actinotherigy (rayfish) Subclass Chondrostea Order Occipenseriformes (Sturgeons & Finfishes) Order Polypteriformis (chordfishes & pitcher fishes).

Fish diversity  Agnatha (Pacific hake fish) Chondrichous fishes (sharks) Actinotheric (Brown Freshwater Fishes) Charopterygii (Seilocanths)  Anatomy and Physiology  Physique The body of a fish consists of three parts, head, midgut and tail. Most of these have scales on their bodies. Some are flat and some are round, some are spiny and some are worm-like. A small goby fish that lives in the waters of the Philippines is only about 13 millimeters long. But the whale shark is about 18 meters (60 feet) long. A whale shark weighs about 14 metric tons (about the weight of two elephants). Some fish come in eye-catching reds, yellows, and blues, and some species have multi-colored circles, stripes, and spots all over their bodies. Respiratory system They breathe through gills and lungs. gills 5-7 parallels have gill slits. A gill cover is found on the gills. Air breathing Some fish breathe with lungs. Circulatory system Fish have a closed-loop circulatory system. The heart moves blood in a loop throughout the body. In most fishes, the heart has four parts, consisting of two chambers, an inlet and an outlet. The first part is the sinus venosus. It has a thin muscular layer. It transports blood from the veins to the second area. An artery is a component permeability. It sends blood to the third part, the vein. Conveying blood to the fourth segment is the pulpus arteriosus. Through this the blood is sent to the plants for oxygenation. Alimentary zone Esophagus has clear organs like stomach, pancreas, etc. Waste disposal zone Kidney is of mesonephric type. Skin - scales There are many types of scales like placoid, cycloid, deinoid and canoid. Central Nervous System sense organs Most fish have advanced sensory organs. Fish have human-like vision for nearly all daylight hours. Many fish species have chemoreceptors, which are unusual sensory organs capable of detecting taste and smell. Most of the fish's senses are located in their lateral lines, which detect gentle currents and vibrations and prompt them to approach nearby fish and prey. Catfish and sharks have a sensory organ known as the Lorangini umbellate. They are capable of detecting even weak millivolt currents in organs. Because some electric fish (gymnotiformes) living in the South American region can generate some weak electric currents, which they use for navigation and social communication. Fish remember places, signals, symbols, landmarks, etc. graphically. Their excellent memory and visual discrimination are scientific marvels. Listening skills Hearing is the most important sense in most fish. Fish sense sounds using their lateral lines and their ears. Although fish have ears, many fish cannot hear very well. Visibility Sight is an important sense for most animals. Fish and terrestrial vertebrates, birds and mammals, have comparatively large spherical arches. Their retinas are usually rod-like and cone-shaped. Thus dark [scotopic] and photosensitive, some species have acquired color vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some fish can see polarized light. Among the jawless fish, the lamprey species have well-developed eyes. Whereas hake fishes are the only ones to have primitive photoreceptors. Fish vision adapts to the visual environment. Deep-sea fish, for example, have well-suited vision for dark environments. Thermal adaptation The body temperature of fish depends on the temperature of the environment in which they live. Does it have its own temperature? Hence fishes are called as warm-weather animals. Some fish species live in the waters of tropical countries, and some fish species live in regions such as the arctic ocean. reproductive system Fishes spawn and produce their young in stages. Asexual fertilization of these can occur inside or outside the body. E.g. Shark, Cutla state of extinction Catching fish in abundance Marine debris, radioactive waste Global warming Water pollution Importance Fish are economically important. Exports and imports of these have a major share in the trade market. Majority of the fish from India is processed and exported abroad. Fish farming for food - Most marine and freshwater fish are caught for food and cooked and eaten. Salai, anchovies, krill, swordfish, navari, prawns are the most commonly used marine fish for food. Aquaculture - Aquaculture Technology Fish are cultivated for beauty and food. Fishing is a form of recreation in many countries.

"Bangkok is the capital and largest city of Thailand. It is rendered in Thai language as Gurung Thep Maha Na Kon (Bangkok). The Thai word Gurung Thep means ""City of Angels"". 9 million people live in Bangkok, which covers an area of ​​1,568.7 square kilometers (605.7sqmi) on the Chao Phraya River basin in central Thailand. This is 12.6 percent of Thailand's population. 14 million people live in the metropolitan area of ​​Bangkok, including the surrounding areas. From a small trading post in the 15th century Ayutthaya Kingdom, Bangkok gradually developed to become the site of two capital cities; Thonpuri in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782. Bangkok was the center of modernization in Thailand, then known as Siam, in the nineteenth century. At that time there was a lot of western influence. In the twentieth century, Bangkok was the center of political struggles in Thailand, where the monarchy was abolished and many revolutions took place. The period from 1960s to 1980s saw the most rapid growth. Bangkok's influence on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society has been significant. Following the Asian economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s, many multinational corporations established their Asian regional headquarters in Bangkok. Thus, Bangkok is an important financial and commercial hub in this region. It is also a hub for international transport and welfare companies. It is also emerging as a regional hub for art, poetry and entertainment events. The bustling road life here and the cultural trails and the widely known red light districts lend a unique charm. The historic grand palace, Buddhist temples like Wat Arun, Wat Pho evoke a different passion from these. This makes Bangkok one of the most tourist-friendly cities in the world. London has been named the third most visited city in the world by MasterCard, after Paris. It has also been named the world's best city for three consecutive years by a global tourism magazine. Today, Bangkok is the most important commercial center in Southeast Asia and a gateway to travel that attracts many tourists. It is home to over 400 lavishly decorated Buddhist temples and one of the largest shopping malls in Asia. Also there are six universities here. Due to the numerous canals found here, the floating markets are also a breeding ground. Thus, Bangkok is often referred to as the ""Venice of the East"". Bangkok has developed rapidly without adequate urban planning and control and lacks proper infrastructure. Due to lack of adequate roads and excessive use of private vehicles, there is always a traffic crisis. Even when the Thai expressway system was set up, this problem has not been solved even today. In the 1990s this caused severe air pollution. To address this, four express train lines have been constructed and operational; More routes are being built and planned. Name   Bangkok (भागकोग etymology is not clear. The root word बेंग is ""river town"",[1] and the name Bang Ko (বুককা), (Ko means ""island"", referring to the area of ​​land formed by the many rivers and canals in the region). [2] Bangkok may have been a colloquial name; however, it has been widely used by foreign travelers and has become official in rhetoric such as the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. The full ceremonial name of Bangkok is Gurung Thep Mahana Kon Aman Rattanakosin Mahindarayutaya Mahatilok Pope Noppharath Ratchadani Purim Udomratsanivet Mahasathan Aman Biman Avathan Sathi Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasith (Audio file "" Th Bangkok ceremonial name.ogg "" not found). With 168 Latin letters, Bangkok's name is the longest name of a city in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records. Contains 139 fonts in the Thai language. The name, which has roots mostly in Pali and Sanskrit, is transliterated as: The City of Devas, the City of Immortals, the City of Sir of the Navaratnas, the City of Kings, the City of Royal Palaces, the Abode of the Incarnate God, was built by Vishwakarma on the orders of Indra.[3] The name Bangkok has been accepted internationally. Local people commonly call it Gurung Thep (City of Angels). Thanundu license plates are marked as Gurung Thep Maha Nakhon. Sister cities As of 2013, Bangkok has been affiliated with 23 cities in 15 countries as sister cities and friendly cities.[4] They are:       Washington, D.

"Japan (Japan) or Japan is a country with many islands in the Asian continent. It is located on the western side of the Pacific Ocean. It is also known as the Land of the Rising Sun. Tokyo is its capital. Sappan comprises a total of 6852 islands. Okaido, Onshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu are the main four islands of Saban and cover 97 percent of the land area.It also ranks 10th in the world with a population of 12.6 million. It is also the fourth largest economic power in the world, and the country with the highest average life expectancy in the world. Country Name In Japanese, the country's name (日本国), pronounced ``Nikon Koku'' or ``Nippon Koku,'' refers to the country east of China, meaning the land of the rising sun, and the country that lives like the sun. In AD 645, Nikon (日本) was first used as a name for Japan.It was established as a name for Japan in 734. The English name defined in Japanese law is Japan. However, more recently the name Nippon has also appeared on postage stamps and coins. The English name sappan is also the gold of another language (French), yapan; (Italian), Japane ; Italian), Habón (Japón; Spanish), Ibonian (Япония; Russian), Eibun (วิ๊สวิว; Thai) etc. In ancient China, the Japanese kan characters ""日本国"" became ""Jibangu"" or ""Japanese"". It is a common opinion that it arose from the custom of pronouncing (In Japan, they use three fonts: Iragana, Katakana, and Kanji) Even now, in some countries, the Japanese Kan character is pronounced according to the language of each country. For example, Reiben (日本; Chinese), Ilbon (일본; Korean), and Nhếp Bản (Vietnamese). Studies show that there are many connections between the Sappan language and the Tamil language. Both languages ​​are said to have similar grammatical structures. Yamato (大和 ; やまと ), ""Achiarano Nakatsu Kuni"" (葦原中国 ; あしはらのなるつくに ), Shinshu (神州 ; しんしゅう), and Oncho (本朝 ; ほんちょう) are different names for Japan in Japanese. From 1889 until 1946, the official name of Japan was ""Tainihon Tegoku"" (大日本帝國; だいにほんていこく; May Japan Empire). History Prehistory and Antiquity BC 30,000 B.C. Paleolithic culture contains Japan's first known settlement. This was followed by the Mesolithic period from around 14,000 BC and then the Neolithic period with a nomadic-forager culture. These tribes included the ancestors of the present-day Ainu people and the Yamato people. Pit dwellings and unimproved agriculture were characteristic of this period. Some of the decorated ceramics from this period are some of the oldest examples of pottery found in the world today. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began arriving in the Japanese islands and intermingled with the Yeomon people. During the Yayoi period, which began around 500 BC, wet-rice agriculture, a new type of pottery, and metallurgy were introduced from China and Korea. The first permanent capital was at Nara in AD. Established in 710. Government and Politics  Japan is an unconstitutional monarchy that gives very few powers to its emperor. As a ceremonial head, the Emperor is ""the symbol of the unity of the nation and the people,"" according to the Constitution of Japan. Power rests mainly with the Prime Minister and other elected members. Whereas sovereignty rests with the people.[1] The current emperor is Akikito. Next to him is Narukito, the crown prince. Japan's legislature is a bicameral parliament called the National Diet. It consists of a 480-member House of Representatives and a 242-member House of Councillors. The members of the House of Representatives are elected by the people once in four years and the members of the House of Councilors are elected once in six years. Everyone over the age of 20 has the right to vote.[2] The Prime Minister is the head of the government. The Emperor appoints a person chosen by Parliament from among the elected members as Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has the power to appoint and remove ministers of the country. Districts Saban's districts are named after four forms: ""Do"" ""Do"" ""Fu"" ""Ken"". ""Do"" refers to Tokyo only, ""Do"" refers to Okaido only, ""Fu"" refers to Osaka and Kyoto, and ""Ken"" refers to the other 43 districts. The important islands and the districts in or adjacent to them are shown below The locations of the districts are indicated by the number preceding the name.   Geography  Japan encompasses 6,852 islands stretching from the Pacific coast to East Asia.[3][4] All islands under the control of this country lie between latitudes 24° - 46°N and longitudes 122° - 146°N. From north to south, the major islands of Japan are Okaido, Onshu, Chikoku, and Kyushu. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa Island, are a chain south of Kyushu Island. Together these are known as the Japanese Archipelago.[5] Approximately 73% of Japan's land area is forested or mountainous, and is unsuitable for agriculture, industry, and housing.[2][6] Thus, the population density of the habitable coastal areas is very high. Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.[7] The Japanese islands are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. These islands were mostly formed as a result of large oceanic movements that took place over several hundred million years from the Middle Silurian to the Pleistocene. This movement occurred as the Philippine Sea Plate moved south under the Amurian Plate and the Okinawan Plate, and the Pacific Plate moved north under the Okhotsk Plate. Formerly Japan was adjacent to the eastern shore of the Eurasian continent. The underlying movement of the aforementioned plates pulled the landmass of present-day Japan eastward about 15 million years ago, creating the Sea of ​​Japan.[8] There are 108 active volcanoes in Japan. Catastrophic earthquakes, often producing tsunamis, occur several times each century.[9] The Tokyo earthquake of 1923 killed 140,000 people.[10] Recent earthquakes include the 1995 Great Ansin earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake[11] of magnitude 9.0 on 11 March 2011. A large tsunami was also generated during the 2011 earthquake.[12] Also on May 24, 2012, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck off the coast of northeastern Japan. However, no tsunami occurred with this. infrastructure According to a 2005 census, about half of Sappan's energy needs come from petroleum, one-fifth from coal and 14% from natural gas. Nuclear power meets a quarter of the country's electricity needs. Road transport is well developed in Sapan. Good roads have been laid for a distance of 1.2 million. Customs are also in use. More than 12 train companies provide local and intercity train services. The cities are connected by Shinkansen (=bullet train) trains. Spanish trains are notorious for being unpunctual. There are 173 airports in Sapan. Airplanes are preferred for intercity transportation. Asia's busiest airport, Anita Airport, is located in Sappan. Yokohama and Nagoya ports are major ports. Culture  The Japanese consider the custom of ""flower viewing"" called hanami (花見) very important. In early spring, a type of cherry blossom blooms in Saban. Flowering period varies from the last week of March to the first week of May depending on the area of ​​Sapan. The media is used to predicting the blooming climate. They also publish the details of the place where the flowers bloom. When the park is in bloom, it is difficult to find a place to sit in the park as the festival is crowded during the holidays. Therefore, they go the night before and look for a good place to sit and spread the mats and tie the border and leave. It is the responsibility of the younger members of the group to find and mark a good place to sit. Sapanis tend to hang out with friends or co-workers or family. People sit together under the blossoming trees and talk stories, play music, sing, dance, drink wine and eat food. Generally it is considered as a full day event. There is also a custom of celebrating at night. The park will also be equipped with electric lights to celebrate at night. When the park is in bloom, there are many temporary stalls selling snacks. The custom of going to the temple on the first day of the English year is widely followed. This custom is called Hatsumode ( 初詣 ). Religions Sintho and Buddhism are the major religions of Sappan. Christianity is also practiced by a minority of people. game Sumo, a traditional sport, is revered as the national sport of Japan. Martial arts such as Sudo and Karate are also practiced. Golf is also a popular sport. Spanish people play football very much.

"The kilogram (abbreviation: kg) is the basic unit of mass in the Standardized International System of Units.[2] A kilogram mass is the mass of an object made of a platinum-iridium alloy that has been kept under very safe, uniform heat stress conditions at Chevre, France. This object is called Le Grand K in French and IPK or International Prototype Kilogram in English. A kilogram equals the mass of approximately one liter of water. The kilogram is the primary standard against which all masses in the world are compared. It is one of the basic international system units with a prefix like kilo. Similarly, it is a unit based on a specific object rather than a natural physical fundamental phenomenon. Although a kilogram is a mass in everyday life, it is common to think of a kilogram as a weight due to Earth's gravity. But mass (mass in Sri Lanka) is not really weight. Weight is the force exerted by Earth's gravity on the mass of an object. This force is measured in Newton. So mass or mass is the materiality, the materiality of matter. The mass of an object is the property that determines the magnitude of the acceleration of the object, regardless of the force exerted on it. A force of one newton on a mass of one kilogram results in an acceleration of one m/N2. Etymology and Usage The word kilogram (kilogramme or kilogram) comes from the French word kilogramme. It comes from Greek to French. It is a word derived from the combination of the word ""χίλιοι"" (chilioi, English chilioi), meaning a thousand, and ""γράμμα"" (gramma, English gramma), meaning a small mass.[3] The term kilogram (kilogramme) was added to French law in 1795. .[4] In the United Arab Kingdom, when it was introduced into English in 1797, the word kilogram was pronounced the same way it was pronounced in French.[5] The word is pronounced in the United States as it is in the United Arab Kingdom. In the United Arab Kingdom, kilogram is spelled as kilogramme, but kilogramme is more common.[6] The kilogramme pronunciation is now recognized by most international organizations. In the 19th century, the short form of the French word kilo (kilo), kilogramme (kilogramme) was brought into the English language. Kilo gives the same meaning as kilogram.[7] When the U.S. Congress introduced the metric system in 1866, that Congress allowed the use of the kilogram as an alternative to the kilogram,[8] but in 1990 regained its use of the term kilogram. [9] The International Kilogram Since 1889, the mass of an object called the kilogram has been defined as the international first kilogram. It is referred to as ""IPK"" (international prototype kilogram) in industrial scales. This international first kilogram is made of a platinum alloy called ""Pt‑10Ir"". This alloy contains 90% ""platinum and 10% iridium. This alloy is made into a rectangle (height=diameter) and the surface area is reduced by 39 mm. The addition of 10% iridium improves the properties of platinum and maintains its hardness and strength and also has the following properties. Resistance to oxidation Very high density (almost twice as dense as air and 21 times as dense as water) Satisfied electrical and thermal conductivity and Low magnetic receptivity International Prototype Kilogram Copies  Various copies of the International Prototype Kilogram are preserved in various countries of the world as follows. IPK is located in Saint-Cloud, France Six sister copies are numbered K1, 7, 8(41),32, 43 and 47 [Note 1] .[10] Preserved in the Saint-Cloud enumeration, France. Ten working copies, eight (9, 31, 42′, 63, 77, 88, 91, and 650[Note 2]) for everyday use and two (25 and 73) for special use .[11] Preserved at Saint-Cloud, France.

Some additional copies are from non-national institutions such as the French Academy of Sciences in Paris (34) and the Istituto di Metrologia G. Colonnetti in Turin (62).[21] Notes Kilo stands for K in the phonetic alphabet used by the United Nations. Kilo refers to 103 or 1000 in the international system. For example 1000 grams, one kilogram 1000 meters, one kilometer 1000 watt, one kilowatt 1000 joules (joule), one kilojoule (one kilo joule). came into formal use in 1795 (and was in use earlier). It comes from the Greek word χίλιοι (""khilioi"") which means thousand. Its use in computer A kilobyte on a computer means 210 or 1024 bytes. Thus, to distinguish it from 1000, many people generally use K instead of the lowercase k, although not everyone follows this practice. Hotdisk manufacturers often consider 1000 bytes to be one kilobyte, however Windows considers 1024 bytes to be 1 kilobyte, which may misrepresent the amount of free space available by hotdisk manufacturers. Because if we consider Kilobyte as 1000 or 1024 then the rate is 2.4% and then when it is Rarabyte it is 10%.

"Socrates (470/469 BC – 399 BC, February 15) [1] was a philosopher from Athens. No clear evidence is available as to when he was born. He is considered one of the most important icons of the Western philosophical tradition. His disciple Plato [2] was also a famous philosopher. Socrates is hailed as the Greek philosopher and the world's first philosopher. He asked the religious people, ""Who is God?"" His best is that Socrates was the first rationalist to ask the question. Socrates is famous for his contribution to the field of ethics as depicted through Plato's dialogues. Philosopher Socrates is known for his philosophical ideas of Socratic Irony and Socratic Method. The latter concept is commonly used as a tool in broad discussion, which is also a form of pedagogy, in which questions are asked not only to elicit individual responses to a series of questions, but also to encourage basic insight. Plato's Socrates contributed important and stable theories related to the theory of light. And his ideology and approach provided a strong foundation for subsequent Western philosophy. Socrates' conundrum No works of Socrates have been found. Thus information about him and his philosophies rests on secondary sources. Furthermore, a close comparison between the contents of these sources exposes some inconsistencies, thus raising concerns about the possibility of knowing deeper truths about the real Socrates. This doubt is known as Socrates' conundrum [3] or Socrates' question [4][5]. One who wants to understand Socrates and his thoughts must first read Plato's works. These are important sources for the life and philosophy of Socrates[6] as are the works of Xenophon[7]. Among these are reports of frank dialogues involving Socrates[8][9]. Other than the Xenophon, the ancient sources available for discovering facts about Socrates' life are mostly philosophical and dramatic texts. There is no direct contemporary history of Socrates. Two factors emerge from all sources relating to Socrates among all the opinions that have resulted in differences in the available sources. While he may have been ugly, Socrates seems to have had a brilliant intellect [10][11]. Birth and Early Life of Socrates No evidence is available as to when Socrates was born. 2450 years ago i.e. BC. Socrates lived in the fifth century. He was born in the Greek city of Athens. His father was a sculptor. His mother is a midwife. At that time when no religion appeared in the world, he became proficient in the origin of human knowledge and logic through his own efforts. Socrates is hailed as the Greek philosopher and the world's first philosopher. Questioning skills As a boy, Socrates had a habit of asking questions. Socrates' habit was to ask questions about anything and find out the truth about it. Socrates examined everything like justice, reason, soul, God, society, government and custom. Socrates spent a great deal of time meeting people in public and conversing with them. But when others ask Socrates a question, Socrates does not directly answer it. Socrates would ask people question after question, focusing on a particular problem, asking them to answer, and asking the people who raised the problem to understand the reason. Socrates, who through his questioning made us realize the cause of the problem, also asked questions to solve the problem. The public was enlightened by such actions; They understood the problem. They also knew the reason. They also realized what needs to be done to overcome it. As a result, the Athenians believed that Socrates would provide clarity to all their problems. Socrates' writings and speeches made people think; It also motivates them to take action Student of Socrates This questioning style of Socrates impressed the youth of Athens. Among the youth, Socrates was always present. Socrates' lodgings were always surrounded by a crowd of young people. His habit of asking questions was also transmitted to the young people. Not only did Socrates think about all the superstitions that had been practiced in Greek society for ages, but the young people also started to change. Similarly, Plato was inspired by Socrates' principles and joined Socrates. Later in the day, he also became a world famous philosopher.  Blame it on Socrates The government of Athens found out that the young people had started to change. When Socrates was surrounded by a crowd of young people, it annoyed some people. Socrates' daily conversation with the young people angered the Greek rulers. There were serious allegations against him. Socrates was sued by the politician Anytus, the artist Melitus, and the orator Lycon. This was due to their hatred of Socrates. Anidas, Lycaon, and Melitus accused Socrates of inciting the youth, inciting religious opposition, of engaging the youth in wrong ways for his own glory, and thereby endangering the Athenian government. Death Penalty After countless allegations, the case came to trial in the court. Then Melidus accused Socrates. He corrupts the youth, blasphemes the gods the Greeks worshiped, creates a new god of his own, explores the heavens and the earth (because the Greeks at that time worshiped nature as their god). He says that the moon is soil and the sun is stone. Introduces new religious doctrines. Socrates is very evil. He said that he should be sentenced to death. Socrates replied, 'I don't want to put my opponents in court and cross-examine them. My just enemies are injustice and ignorance. I refuse to acknowledge that I am lord of stone and earth. If researching about God and His creation is atheism, fearing where they will refuse to acknowledge God is more atheism than that. After this came the moment of judgment in the court. Two boxes were kept, Death and Forgiveness. 501 members of the Judiciary begin voting. 220 voted to pardon Socrates and 281 voted to sentence him to death. The judges declared Socrates guilty and ordered Socrates to declare what punishment he should be given. that he has not committed any crime; Socrates argued that his mother had done good for the country by her actions, and for that the court should have awarded her praise and reward instead of punishment. But if this Court decides to impose a penalty, it should be a fine; Socrates declared in court that his friends were ready to pay the fine to the government. The judges expected Socrates to apologize for his actions. But instead his arguments in court irritated the judges. So that Socrates should be poisoned and killed in BC. The judges ordered on 15th February 339. Death The court ruled that the sentence would be executed after 30 days due to some reasons, and until then, Socrates' legs should be chained. Then the day of execution came. Socrates, who bought the poisoned cup, said, ""What should I do next?"" said. He said, “You must drink the poison in the cup. You should be walking around the prison after drinking. ""You should lie down when your legs are weak,"" said the jailer. Socrates finished drinking a cup of poison with a smile on his face. Seeing it, all the friends burst into tears.  ""Why do you shed tears like women?"" Socrates asked with a smile and started walking. After walking for a while, he lay down on the ground. The poisoner squeezed Socrates' legs and said, ""Do you see me squeezing your legs?"" He said. ""No"" said Socrates. After a while his eyes closed. Socrates' method His method of philosophical inquiry, known as the Socratic method or the Elenchos method, is his most important contribution to Western thought. He often used this method to test (examine) important points of virtue. For this, Socrates is regarded as the father and fountainhead of Virtue or Virtue Philosophy and thus of general philosophy.

"A number is a mathematical object used for counting, measuring and classifying. There are many types of numbers in mathematics. The primes for numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) are the basic examples of numbers.[1] The notation used to denote numbers is called numeral.[2] It can be assumed that the concept of 'number' was created when man learned to count his fingers at the time of his birth. The development of the concept of numbers is the origin of mathematics. In mathematics, over the centuries, sets of numbers such as zeros[3] negative numbers,[4] rational numbers ({{math|1/2, ), real numbers,[5] (]], π), problem numbers [6] [4] Stretched out. In Arithmetic, numbers are predicted through the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Number theory explains the properties of numbers. The concept of number has been important to Tamils ​​since ancient times. Thiruvalluvar's saying, ""Ennenpa enai eklaenpa; these two are eyes for the living being"" and Olavaiyar's saying ""Ennenpa ikazhel"" explain the importance attached to numbers and letters in Palanthamizhar thought. Classification Numbers are classified into number sets or moments such as natural number, prime number.[7] Major Classifications of Numbers: Natural numbers are the most familiar numbers in practice, the natural numbers used for counting. These are also called natural numbers or natural numbers. These are 1, 2, ... This number is denoted in mathematics by the special letter block (moment). Integers Adding positive and negative numbers (-1, -2, -3, ...) to natural numbers form the moment of integers. is the symbol of the moment. There are three types of integers: prime or even numbers: 1, 2, 3, ... Witchcraft or witchcraft: 0 Negative numbers or negative numbers: -1, -2, -3, ... The moment of these integers includes the moment of natural numbers. That is, rational numbers are called fractional numbers or rational numbers that are represented by whole numbers up and down a fraction represented by ratios made up of whole numbers such as half, quarter, and one-third. These can be lowercase numbers such as half-quarters, half-cents, or fractions (fractions, fractions), or even numbers that represent an extreme number such as 7/3, 21/6. These category numbers are denoted by the letter Kanam. This proportional moment includes the moment of integers. That is. Mathematicians have known from Greek mathematics and Hindu Sutras that not all real numbers are proportional numbers. But it was not until the 19th century that man knew without a doubt that there was a great number which included all the numbers we encounter in life. The elements of a number are called prime numbers and intrinsic numbers because they exist. In this, if the rational numbers are removed, the other numbers are called non-rational numbers. Irrational numbers are of two types: algebraic numbers and prime numbers. Complex numbers All the numbers above are the creations of mathematicians. For example, complex numbers (a type of number called polynomial, or complex number) play an important role in mathematics and all its applications. They are denoted by the symbol moment of complex numbers. Every complex number has an internal part (real part) and an external part (imaginary part). Each number z in where a and b are real numbers, a is the real part of z, and b is the imaginary part of z. The relationship between these oil types is as shown below: Prime Numbers A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and the same number. 1 and other natural numbers with denominators other than the same number (except 1) are called composite numbers. For example, the natural number 11 is a prime number. It has no divisors other than 1. Nature number 6 is a mixed girl. Because its denominators are: 1, 2, 3, 6. Not only in mathematics, but in many branches of science, the concept of prime number contributes to many relationships about numbers. Prime numbers play an important role in number theory. Even though the concept of prime numbers has not existed since the beginning of numbers, in theory it must have originated in the mind of man and thus the beginning of science. After centuries of not being able to study some ideas about prime numbers, nowadays, with the help of computers, they are being studied again with great success. Digits Digits or numerals are different from numbers. Digits are symbols that represent numbers. There are many types of number systems in circulation. The Egyptians were the first to discover cryptographic numerals, followed by the Greeks who associated numbers with the Ionian and Doric alphabet.[8] Roman numerals, an addition to the alphabet, were in major use in Europe until the Middle Ages, when Arabic numerals were introduced in the later 14th century. Arabic numerals are still the most widely used numerals in the world today.[9] Arabic numerals were made more useful by Puchium, discovered by ancient Indian mathematicians around 500 AD.[9] Kabregar numbers Kabregar numbers are significant in mathematics invented by the Indian mathematician Kabregar. For example, 703 is referred to as a cabaret number. The characteristics of this number are that the square of this number, i.e. the product of multiplying this number by the same number, is classified into two parts, and the product of the two parts is the root number, i.e. 703. 703 X 703 = 494209 Product 494209 and two parts of 494 and 209 The product of these two parts is: 494 + 209 = 703 History Animal bones were the first used by humans for numbering.[10] The Mesopotamians were the first people in history to use numbers as value. They are K. By 3400 BC they were using the hexadecimal number system. Egyptians By 3100 BC they were using the decimal number system.[11] The Babylonians and Egyptians used the term shurya (0) and the Indians used shurya as the term zero.[12] Negative Numbers Abstract sets of negative numbers were realized in China in the period from 100 BC to 50 BC. Various methods of representing numbers have been dealt with in the book of Mathematical Art, which covers the nine properties. Red dashes were used to indicate even numbers. Dark circles were used to indicate opposite numbers.[13] The first mentions of these oils in Western use date back to AD. They were found in Greece in the third century. In Diophantus' Arithmetica, the inverse number was mentioned as a solution to an equation 4x + 20 = 0. Also, this equation gave an absurd solution. AD Over 600 periods of time, negative numbers were used in debt settlement in India. AD The ""Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta"" by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in 628 discussed the earlier references to Tyhopandhas more openly. The Quadratic formula, which was developed by Brahmagupta using opposite numbers, usually consisting of four parts, is still in use today. However, in India in the twelfth century Basukara gave opposite sources for quadratic equations. He also said that the negative value will not be accepted. Due to inadequacy of counter sources, people do not accept them. Until the seventeenth century, most European mathematicians resisted the idea of ​​negative numbers. However, Fibonacci allowed opposite solutions to financial problems. There, they were first taken as loans (Liber Abaci, Chapter 13 of 1202). Thereafter, they were considered as substitutes for Nuts. At the same time, the Chinese drew a diagonal line through the straight line of even numbers and indicated the opposites of those even numbers.[14] In the fifteenth century, Nicolas Chuquet was the first to introduce the use of negative numbers in European mathematical operations. He used those numbers as exponents. However, he referred to them as Absurd numbers. Prime numbers The existence of prime numbers was first established by Liouville in 1844 and 1851. In 1873, Hermite proved that e was a prime number. In 1882 Lindemann proved that is a prime number. Finally, Cantor described the set of prime numbers as uncountably infinite. But he referred to the set of algebraic numbers as countably infinite. Therefore, odd numbers are infinite. Infinity The mathematical concept of infinity is mentioned in the Esurveda, an ancient Indian scripture. One of the points it makes is that if a part is removed from infinity, or if one is added to infinity, infinity remains unchanged. BC 400 Among the Jain mathematicians, infinity was a prominent subject of their philosophical education. They classified infinity into five categories. They are: Unidirectional infinity Bidirectional infinity Area infinity Annual infinity Vertical infinity See also Tamil numbers Number system List of numbers Mathematical constants Odd and even numbers Prime numbers Small numbers Big numbers Order based on quantity (numbers).

"An elephant is a herbivorous (leaf-eating) mammal. It is the largest of all land animals. It is also very long-lived (~70 years). It is the longest living land animal besides humans. Elephants are very strong. The beasts of prey and the highest in the food hierarchy of wild animals, the lion (Arima), the tiger, etc., are unapproachable in strength. Lions gang up and kill a tired or young elephant that might come alone. However, such incidents are very rare. Elephants live in families. Also, they have high memory capacity. Only three elephants remain in the world today. They are African bush elephants, African forest elephants and Asian elephants. There are significant differences between them. Generally, all elephants live up to about 70 years. A male elephant is called Kaliru. A female elephant is called Bd. A baby elephant is called a calf or cub. The sound made by an elephant is called bellowing. Elephant Species African elephants are larger in stature than Asian elephants. They have large ear lobes. Both male and female African elephants have tusks. However, ivory is rarely found in Asian female elephants. The back of African elephants curves slightly inwards behind the head and is flat without raised forehead ridges. These have two petals at the apex of the thallus. But the front feet have four or five claws and the hind feet have three claws. Asian elephants have slightly raised backs. There are two ridges on the forehead and small ear lobes. There is only one petal at the apex of the thallus (upper margin). The front feet have five claws and the hind feet have four claws. Food and Habitat Elephants are herbivores or herbivores. They like to eat bamboo and sugarcane. They spend 16 hours a day gathering food. Also, their digestive capacity is very slow. Therefore, 40 percent of these foods are digested. Hence, they tend to consume a lot of food. Well-grown elephants consume about 140 to 270 kg of food per day. Physique Male elephants are typically 3 meters tall and weigh 6000 kilograms. Elephant skin is very thick. There will be a thickness of about 3 cm. However, it will be slow. Thus, mosquitoes etc. will also bite. An elephant has four strong legs. Despite its bulky body, the elephant can climb and descend hills and steep places efficiently. The proverb ""the foot of an elephant glides"" is a reference to the elephant's ability to walk in long ups and downs. Trunk The special feature of an elephant is its trunk. It is best seen only in elephants. Although a few animals have a slightly elongated frontal nose (like the proboscis monkey), there are no animals with long trunk-like limbs. The trunk is made up of a total of 40,000 muscles. It is flexible in all directions. At the tip of the trunk are the nostrils through which the elephant breathes, and tiny, highly sensitive fingertips.[1] The trunk can lift anything from a small stick to a large tree. They usually help in picking up food and drinking water. The elephant repels attacks from hostile animals with its trunk. Because the neck is short the prominence of the trunk is great. Tusk Elephants have two tusks. These are called elephant lines. This elephant coat is present only in male elephants (Kalurukku) in Asiatic Indian elephants and not in female elephants (Pitukku). But African wild elephants, both male and female, have a stripe (both male and female). The elephants living in Sumatra and Borneo, the elephants of Sri Lanka, are bisexual (Kaliru, Pd) and often have an elephant line. An elephant's tusk is an extension of an elephant's molars. Hence these are also called elephant's tusks or tusks (tusks and tusks mean teeth). Tusks can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet). And they can weigh up to 90 kilograms. These tusks are also used for trade. In March 2015, Ethiopia burned six tons of ivory taken from several elephants.[2] Leather Elephant skin is very thick. Thick skin is found in most parts of the body. The skin is about two and a half centimeters thick. However, the skin around its mouth and inside the ear is thin. Asian elephants generally have more hair on their skin than African elephants. Elephants usually smear mud or dirt all over their bodies. This is an important characteristic of elephant society. It helps to protect the skin of the elephant from the sun's heat and radiation. Although the elephant's skin is thick, it is very sensitive. This is why elephants spit mud or dirt after bathing. Legs They have strong legs to support the elephant's large body. They don't need much muscle power to stand because of their straight legs and wide feet. So they can stand for a long time without resting. African elephants often do not sit unless they are sick or injured. But Asian elephants rest often. The elephant has got a broad round foot (foot). The African elephant has three tusks (claws) on its hind legs and four on its front legs. The Asian elephant has four tusks on the hind legs and five on the front legs. Elephants can swim and climb well. These cannot be jumped. Ears Elephants have very large broad lobed ears. They play an important role in maintaining the elephant's body temperature. Elephant's ears are full of blood vessels. The ambient air cools down as the heated blood flows into the ears. Then it goes into the body and lowers the temperature. Due to blood circulation, this process is continuous and the temperature is kept under control. This is why elephants are always seen moving their ears. The upper margin of a grown elephant's ear is folded outward in the Asian elephant, and curled inward in the African elephant.[3] Cognition The elephant's brain is the largest of all land animals. It weighs a little over five kilograms. Elephants have good memory. After elephants and dolphins, elephants are considered to be the most intelligent animals. Elephants are said to be second to humans in intelligence. Elephant brains are also superior in structure and technique. They also learn to use tools. Elephants are generally compassionate.[4] Sensory Sense Elephants have excellent hearing and sense of smell. The elephant's eye is slightly myopic. Thus, an elephant relies on its keen sense of hearing and subtle sense of smell rather than its sight.[5] Their trunks are also sensitive. Not only their ears but also their trunks are capable of sensing vibrations. Their feet are capable of sensing very low frequency sound waves. Social Life The social life of greens is different from the life of pits. Embryos live with their mother's group until they reach puberty, then mostly alone. But the Bds live as a well-knit family of mother, sister and daughter. Adolescence is also observed during the breeding season. Self-awareness Elephants are self-aware. It is established by glass testing. Elephants recognize themselves when placed in front of a mirror. This ability has so far only been found in baboons, some monkeys, and dolphins. A study conducted among domesticated elephants in Zimbabwe suggests that elephants have the ability to understand a person's pointing.[6] A breeding elephant has a gestation period of 22 months. This is the longest gestation period in mammals. They usually give birth to only one calf. Twins are very rare. A newborn baby elephant weighs between 90 – 115 kilograms. Before, during, and after calving, the elephant is greatly assisted by the presence of other adult elephants. From birth, the calf is raised by the herd. Threats Poaching A major threat to elephants is poaching. Elephants are hunted for their tusks. Large, long-lived and slow-breeding elephants, over-hunting has a major impact. They are large and cannot be hidden easily. Each elephant takes years to grow and breed. Each elephant needs an average of 140 kilograms (300 pounds) of leaves per day. Due to the destruction of large animals like tigers and lions, small herbivores competing for elephants' food are multiplying and destroying plants, making it difficult for elephants to get food. Elephants are rarely killed for food by animals other than humans. Habitat Shrinkage Another important threat is the destruction of elephant habitats. Humans are destroying elephant habitats for agricultural expansion. This creates conflicts between the interests of humans and the interests of elephants. For example, elephants enter new agricultural settlements, destroying crops and endangering lives of people. An average of 150 elephants and 100 humans die in Sri Lanka every year due to such conflicts. Deforestation also reduces the habitat of elephants. Habitat loss is said to be the primary reason for the extinction of Asian elephants. Elephants require large areas of forest to survive. Because elephants enter an area in droves and destroy trees and plant vines. Then they go somewhere else. Thus the destroyed forests go to new places and re-grow and come back to the same place and get food. As habitats shrink, food runs out very quickly.[7] Humans and Elephants As elephants are killed legally and against the law by humans, there are unintended consequences for elephants' physiology. Ivory poachers in Africa hunt elephants with large tusks, leaving the remaining elephants with small tusks or no tusks. Newly born cubs are also more likely to be born with these, leading to the addition of tuskless genes in new generations, leading to the birth of large numbers of tuskless elephants. The number of such elephants has increased from 1% in 1930 to 30% in some areas. Edentulism was once a rare genetic mutation and is now becoming a common hereditary trait. Mortality Elephants can die of heart failure, heart attack, and cerebral hemorrhage.[8] Elephant in Sangam Literature In Tamil Sangam literature, the elephant is mentioned in more than 170 names.

"Babylon (Babylon) Aramaic: בבל, Babel; Arabic: بَابِل‎, Bābil; Hebrew: בָּבֶל‎, Bavel; Classical Syriac: ܒܒܠ‎, Bāwēl) was an ancient city that flourished from 1800 BC to the end of the 6th century BC on the left and right banks of the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq. Babylon was the capital of the Babylonian kingdom. By 2300 BC, the city of Babylon was a minor city in the Akkadian Empire. The city of Babylon was the city-state of the first dynasty of Babylonia in the 19th century BC. Babylonian king Ammurabi expanded the city of Babylon and made it his capital. After Ammurabi, the city of Babylon was part of the Assyrian Empire of the Old Assyrians, the Kassites, and the Kingdom of Elam. After the destruction of Babylon, the city of Babylon was rebuilt and became one of the capitals of the New Assyrian Empire (609 – 539 BC). The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are world famous. After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the city of Babylon became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 626 BC to 539 BC. It later came under the control of Persia, the Achaemenid Empire, the Seleucid Empire, the Parthian Empire, the Roman Empire, and the Sasanian Empire. Between 1770 BC - 1671 BC and 612 BC - 320 BC Babylon was one of the largest cities in the world, covering an area of ​​900 hectares.[2][3][4] The ruins of the city of Babylon are found in the Tell archaeological field, 85 km south of Baghdad, in the Hilla region of the Babil Governorate of Iraq, with mud-brick ruined buildings. At the archaeological site of Babylon, clay tablets with cuneiform writing from the 6th century BC have been found.[5] Geography The ruins of the ancient city of Babylon have been found at the Tell archaeological site of the town of Hilla, 85 km south of Baghdad, in Babil Governorate, Iraq, west of the Euphrates River.[6] Sources are known from the historical records of the ancient city of Babylon, inscriptions found in the archaeological sites of Uruk, Nippur and Haradum in Iraq. Information about the Neo-Babylonian city comes from archaeological excavations and from ancient Greek historians such as Herodotus and Isutrapo.[7] Early Sources References to the city of Babylon can be found in ancient Akkadian and Sumerian literature dating back to 3,000 BC. A flint tablet inscribed in obelisks dating to the time of the Akkadian emperor Šar-kali-šarri contains references to the foundations of temples to the gods Anunnith and Ilaba in the city of Babylon. History In the 19th century BC, the Amorites, a nomadic people of the northern Levant who spoke East Semitic languages, conquered southern Mesopotamia and Babylonia and established the city-state of Babylon. The Old Babylonian Period In the 21st - 20th centuries BC, the Amorite people who migrated from the northern Levant region to the Babylonian region of southern Mesopotamia with the Elamite people were stopped by the rulers of the old Assyrian Empire. While the Assyrians turned their attention to conquering Asia Minor, the Amorites established their settlements in Babylon. Early Babylon was a city-state. Before Ammurabi (1792–1750 BC) became the city-state of Babylon, the city of Babylon was under the rulers of Assyria, Elam, Larsa, and Isin. Ammurabi, the king of Babylon, conquered Elam, Mari, and Elba. Ammurabi established the Babylonian kingdom as king of the city-state of Babylon. Then Babylon came under the old Assyrian Empire. Medieval Babylon The city of Babylon was conquered by the Ittaites in 1595 BC. The city of Babylon was under the ancient Persian Kasitu people, until 1160 BC, for 435 years. Later Babylon of the Kasitu people remained until the Old Assyrian Empire (1365–1053 BC). Assyrian Emperor Tukulti I - Ninurta was crowned in Babylon in 1235 BC. In 1155 BC, the Assyrians and Elamites attacked the city of Babylon, and the people left Babylon. Babylon then came under the rule of the Akkadian Empire for the first time. Then again under the rule of the Assyrians, Babylon became a minor kingdom. Babylon was conquered by West Semitic-speaking Armenians from the Levant in the 11th century BC, and by the Salters in the 9th century BC. During the reign of the Neo-Assyrian emperor Sennacherib [9] (705 – 681 BC), the city of Babylon was completely destroyed in the revolts of the local leader Marduk-apla-iddina II with the help of the Elamites. Babylon city walls, temples and palaces were completely destroyed in 689 BC. The city of Babylon was rebuilt under the reign of Esarhatton (681–669 BC). Against the rule of Ashurbanipal, the ruler of Babylon, the governor of Nineveh and his younger brother Samas-sum-Ukin, with the help of the Elamites, Chaldeans, Persians, Jews, and Arabs of southern Mesopotamia, led a civil war and captured the city of Babylon in 625 BC. The Assyrians besieged the city of Babylon with a large force for a long time and reintegrated Babylon into the new Assyrian Empire. Kandalunu was appointed governor of Babylon by the New Assyrian Empire. During the reign of the Neo-Assyrian emperors who succeeded Assur-Banibal, a series of civil wars in Babylon led to the end of the Neo-Assyrian Empire that ruled Babylon in 608 BC.[10] Neo-Babylonian Empire - 626 to 539 BC After the death of the Neo-Assyrian emperor Assur-Banibal in 627 BC, during the Assyrian Civil War in 626 BC, Nabu-Abla-Usur, the 11th Dynasty Babylonian Nabu-Abla-Usur, accompanied by the Medes, Persians, and Scythians conquered Babylon and Nineveh. 12] conquered cities and established the New Babylonian Empire. The city of Babylon became the capital of the New Babylonian Empire. In the Neo-Babylonian Empire, when the city of Babylon ruled autonomously from 629 BC, temples were built according to the Sumerian-Akkadian tradition. Aramaic is the spoken language of the people. Akkadian is the official language. The orthography of the Akkadians was fixed. According to Akkadian custom, royal women were appointed as temple priestesses. Nebuchadnezzar II built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar II drove the Jews out of Babylon. Persian Invasion Fall of Babylon The 87-year-old Neo-Babylonian Empire was conquered by the Achaemenidian emperor Cyrus at the Battle of Opis in 539 BC and incorporated into his empire. The Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Assyrian Empire were minor states of the Achaemenid Empire.[13][7][14][15] Hellenic Period During the Hellenic Period, the last emperor of the Achaemenid Empire, Emperor Alexander, conquered the city of Babylon in 331 BC.[16] After Alexander's death in Babylon in 323 BC, the kingdoms conquered by Alexander during the Hellenistic period were divided and ruled by Greek generals, including Seleucus Nicotor. Areas including West Asia and Central Asia came under the Seleucid Empire of Seleucus Nicotarus. Back in the Persian Empire, Babylon and Assyria were a province under the Persian Parthian and Sasanian empires for nine centuries, until 650 AD. The Babylonians cherished their culture and Aramaic language. Christianity was introduced in Babylon in the 1st – 2nd centuries AD. Islamic Invasions At the end of the 7th century AD, the Muslim Ottoman Empire conquered Mesopotamia and Babylon and converted most of the Babylonian population to Islam. Jasiah was forced to pay taxes on Babylonian Jews and Christians who refused to convert to Islam, so they left Babylon. By the 10th century AD, the only Jewish temple in Babylon was a ruined temple.[17] References to the city of Babylon in medieval Arabic literature state that the city of Babylon was located on the route from Baghdad to Basra.[18][19] In modern times, in the 18th century AD, archaeologists from British India, including European nationals, excavated Babylonia and the cities of Baghdad and Basra in Mozabad. The rare artefacts found in the excavations were displayed in museums such as Berlin. The Government of Iraq Since the establishment of the modern Iraqi government in 1920, images of Babylonian artefacts have been emblazoned on postage stamps and postcards. In 1960, the entrance gate of Ishtar Temple was replicated and displayed to the public. On 14 February 1978, Saddam Hussein restored the ruined archaeological sites of Babylon, Nineveh, Ur and Nimrud in Iraq. He repaired the dilapidated palaces built by Nebuchadnezzar II. The City of Babylon in the Bible Babel is the Hebrew name originally given to the Babylonian city. It is the site of the Tower of Babel. The origin of the name is told in Genesis 11:9. Accordingly, it is the biblical view that the name Babel is a derivative of the Hebrew word ""Babel"" meaning confusion. But this. The researcher is of the opinion that it is a derivative of ""Pab-Ilu"" meaning ""Gate of God"" in Akkadian. Genesis 10:10[20] mentions Babylon as the residence of King Nimrod. And in Genesis 11:1-9[21] after the flood, the people left the mountain where the ark rested and settled in a plain. There they built a very high tower reaching to the sky. It was called the Tower of Babel. In later times Babel was changed to the common Greek word Babylon.

"Republic Day of India marks the date on which the Constitution of India came into force as the governing document of India, replacing the Government of India Act, 1935.[1] It is one of the major national holidays of India. History January 26 was chosen by Gandhiji as Liberation Day to commemorate the 1930 Indian Liberation Movement called Poorna Swaraj. On that day, local Congress leaders gathered in urban and rural areas and took the Liberation Day Pledge suggested by Gandhiji as seen below[2]: ""To submit to a government that is harming our motherland in all four ways - economic, political, cultural and spiritual - is a betrayal of man and God."" On 28 August 1947 a Drafting Committee was formed to frame a permanent constitution and BR Ambedkar was appointed as its Chairman. The group submitted a draft constitution to the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1947. 2 years, 11 months, 166 days in public open sessions, many debates preceded the meeting and adoption of the Constitution. Finally on 24 January 1950 two handwritten permanent constitutions in English and Hindi were signed with the assent of 308 members of Parliament. Two days after that, in 1950, the Nehru Cabinet decided and declared and implemented the celebration of January 26, the liberation day established by the Gandhis 17 years before the liberation, as Democracy Day.[2][3] It is celebrated as Republic Day since 1950. way to celebrate In the national capital In the national capital, Delhi, the President of India visits the Veterans' Parade by hoisting the tricolor in a ceremony that begins with the Indian Prime Minister paying homage to the fallen Indian Army soldiers at the Amarsothi at India Gate. A Republic Day parade will be held in the capital Delhi on Republic Day. Medals and awards are given to veterans who have rendered great service to the country in the past year. In state capitals In the states, the state governor observes the flag hoisting, guard parade, government floats and cultural events. Awards are given to the best guards.

"The Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Empire, 1299–1922, Turkish: Osmanlı Devleti 'Osmanli Davlati' or Osmanlı İmparatorluğu) was an empire ruled by the Turks. It was also known as the Turkish Empire. This empire AD Formed in northwestern Anatolia in 1299 under the leadership of Osman Bey, a Turkic dynasty. After being conquered by Sultan Muhammad II in 1453 AD, the Othman Kingdom was transformed into an empire.[1][2][3] At its peak (16th - 17th centuries), the empire covered three continents: Southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, from the Strait of Gibraltar in the west to the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf in the east, Austria, Sylvakia, parts of Ukraine, Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia in the south. and spread as far as Yemen. The Ottoman Empire had a total of 29 provinces. The name Empire in Ottoman Turkish is referred to as Dawlat e Aliyiye Osmaniyyi (دَوْلَتِ عَلِيّه عُثمَانِیّه) or Osmanli Dawlatti (عثمانلى دولتى). In modern Turkish it is known as 'Osmanlı Devleti or Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'. In some Western records it is used under the two names ""Ottoman"" and ""Turkey"". double write This time, in the period of 1920-1923, Ankara-based Turkey was brought to an end and since then the separate term Turkey has been used officially. History Emergence (1299-1453) After the fall of the Turkish Seljuk Sultanate in 1300 AD, the region of Anatolia inhabited by the predecessors of the Ottomans became a fragmented independent region with several Turkish states known as the Ghazi Emirates. It was a Ghazi republic ruled by Osman I (1258[4] –1326). The name Othmann was derived from the name Usman and later became known as Othman. Osman I expanded the Turkish settlements towards the edge of the Byzantine Empire. In the century following the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to expand through the eastern Mediterranean and the Falkland. Osman's son Urhan captured the city of Bursa in 1324 and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. That is, the fall of Bursa lost control of northwestern Anatolia to the Byzantine Empire. The main city, Thessalonica, was captured from the Venetians in 1387. The conquest of Kosovo by the Ottomans in 1389 ended Serb control over the region and led to the Ottomans establishing a foothold in Europe. At the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, a large army, considered the Crusader of the Middle Ages, could not prevent the Turkish Ottomans from succeeding. The expansion of Turkish rule over the Falkland led to the intention to capture Constantinople. Expansion and ascendancy (1453–1566) Murad II's son, Muhammad II, reorganized the kingdom and army and captured Constantinople on 29 May 1453. In exchange for accepting Ottoman rule, Muhammad II allowed orthodox Christian churches to operate autonomously in their lands. Because of the bad relationship between the European ruling states and the eventual Byzantine Empire. The majority of orthodox people accepted the Ottoman government more willingly than the Venetian government.[5] During the 15th and 16th centuries the Ottoman Empire entered a period of expansion. During this period the empire saw great growth and came under the leadership of strong and capable sultans. Trade between Europe and Asia was carried out through the routes controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Thus this empire flourished economically as well.[6] Sultan Salim I (1512–1520) defeated Shah Ismail, the Sabavid ruler of Persia, at the Battle of Chaldiran and expanded the Ottoman Empire east and west.[7] Salim I established an Ottoman government in Egypt and built a navy stationed in the Red Sea. After this expansion of the Ottoman Empire, the rivalry between the Portuguese Empire and the Ottoman Empire began as a powerful empire.[8] Suleiman I (1520–1566) captured Belgrade in 1521, and the central and northern parts of the Hungarian Empire were conquered in the Ottoman–Hungarian War.[9] After winning the historic Battle of Muhacs in 1526, Ottoman rule was established over the rest of Central Europe in present-day Hungary (except the western part). By the end of Suleiman I's reign, the empire's total population was approximately one and a half million people, spread over three continents, and the empire's powerful navy controlled much of the Mediterranean.[10] Stagnation and Reform (1566–1827) Stephen Lee says that after 1566 the empire began to decline into stagnation. At intervals there were periods of recovery and reformation. The decline accelerated and reached its peak in 1699.[11] Although many historians dispute this claim, many attribute the decline of the Othman Empire to factors such as ""bad sultans, incompetent prime ministers, weak war instruments, disaffected armies, corrupt officials, greedy investors, strong enemies, treacherous friends"".[12] Attributing failure of leadership as the primary cause, Lee says that of the ten sultans who ruled from 1292 to 1566, all but one were highly competent. He says that all but two of the 13 sultans who ruled from 1566 to 1703 were disengaged and incompetent.[13] The failure of the central government in a highly centralized system led to its decline. As a direct result the provincial nobility grew stronger and began to avoid Constantinople. European enemies were also getting stronger. The Ottoman forces remained underdeveloped.[14][15] Finally the Ottoman economy collapsed. War-induced inflation, changes in the direction of world trade, and law and order problems hampered economic progress.[16] Decline and Modernization (1828–1908) The forces were modernized by a series of government reforms during the Danzimat period (1839–1876). Banking system improved. Homosexuality was decriminalized. Secular laws evolved to replace religious laws.[17] Modern industries were built for artists. The Ottoman Ministry of Posts was established on October 23, 1840.[18][19] Samuel Morse was patented in 1847 for inventing the telegraph.[20] The first telegraph line was then laid between Istanbul (Constantinople) - Adrianople - Sumnu.[21] The Constitution was enacted at the peak of this period. But the constitutional government lasted only two years. The empire's Christian citizens, who were highly educated, were economically ahead of the Muslim majority. This created resentment among Muslims.[22] In 1861 there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for Ottoman Christians. Of these, 140,000 students studied.[22][22] In 1911, of the 654 wholesale establishments in Istanbul, 528 were owned by Greeks.[22] The Crimean War (1853–1856) was part of a long struggle by European powers to assert their influence over territories under the weakening Ottoman Empire. The financial crisis caused by the war forced the Ottoman Empire to borrow £5 million from foreign countries on August 4, 1854.[23][24] And as a result, 200,000 Crimean Tatars immigrated to the Ottoman Empire.[25] At the end of the Caucasian Wars, 90 percent of Caucasians were massacred.[26] As a result, they fled their homes in the north of Caucasus and sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire.[27][28][29] Some estimates put a total of fifteen hundred thousand displaced or killed.[30] Basi-Basuk, where 100,000 people were killed during the Bulgarian uprising of 1876.[31] Russia won the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. As a result, the Ottoman Empire lost its European territories. Bulgaria was established as an autonomous principate in the Ottoman Empire. Romania was given complete freedom. Serbia and Montenegro were liberated. In 1878, Austria-Hungary arbitrarily annexed the Ottoman provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Novi Basar. Although the Ottoman government resisted this, its forces were defeated within three weeks. British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli helped restore the Ottoman Empire's territories in the Balkan Peninsula to the Archdiocese of Berlin. In return, Britain was given Cyprus.[32] Britain also gained control of the region by sending troops to Egypt in 1882 on the pretense of helping Ottomans quell the Urabic rebellion. Up to 300,000 Armenians were killed in the Ametiya massacres of 1894 to 1896.[33] Thus, in the shrinking Ottoman Empire, the Falconian Muslims migrated to the Falcon or Anatolia regions.[34] In 1923, Anatolia and Eastern Tiras were the only Muslim areas.[35] Defeat and dissolution (1908–1922) After the Young Turk Revolution on 3rd July 1908, attempts were made to establish a second constitutional government. In 1876, the Sultan announced that the constitution and parliament would be amended. Political and military reforms were carried out for the next six years. This marked the beginning of the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 amid civil unrest. But to avoid a battle it withdrew its forces from the occupied Novi Bazaar. Udumania lost Libya during the Italo-Turkish War (1911–12). The Falcon League nations waged war on Udumania. The Ottoman Empire lost in these wars (1912–13). As a result, the Ottoman Empire lost most of the Balkan lands except Eastern Thrace. It also lost the historic Ottoman capital of Edirne. About 400,000 Muslims migrated to present-day Turkey fearing sectarian violence. Many of these died en route from the emetic plague.[36] From 1821 to 1922, hundreds of thousands of Muslims were killed in the Muslim genocide of the Falcon countries. Many were expelled.[37][38][39] By 1914 the Ottoman Empire had been driven from most of Europe and North Africa. However, during the reign of the empire, one and a half million people lived in present-day Turkey, 4.5 million in Syria, Palestine and Jordan, and 2.5 million in Iraq. In addition, 5.5 million people were under the control of the Ottoman Empire in the Arabian Peninsula.[40] In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers. Early in the war, the Ottoman Empire had significant victories such as the Battle of Gallipoli, but lost the Caucus war against Russia. The United States did not declare war on the Ottoman Empire.[41] In 1915 Russian forces entered Old Armenia.[42] As the Armenians cooperated, the Ottoman Empire sought to expel and kill the Armenians. This is known as the Armenian Genocide.[43] Genocide also occurred against the Greek and Assyrian minorities.[44] The Arab Revolution of 1916 turned against the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East. According to the final agreement, the Ottoman Empire was divided. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 9 million Turkish-Muslim refugees migrated from the Caucasus, Crimea, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean islands to Anatolia and eastern Thrace.[45] The siege of Constantinople and the siege of Izmir highlighted the Turkish national movement. Led by Mustafa Kemal, this movement won the Turkish War of Independence (1919–22). The last Sultan, Muhammad VI, who ruled from 1918 to 1922, left the country on November 17, 1922. The Turkish National Assembly established the Republic of Turkey on October 29, 1923. The Caliphate was also dissolved on March 3, 1924.[46] Citations External links * Category:Islamic Empires Category:Former countries of Africa Category:Former countries of Asia Category:Former countries of Europe ",Who was the last ruler of the Ottoman Empire?,Mohammed VI,12449
"Mars is a planet in the solar system. It is the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is the second smallest planet in this family after Mercury, the smallest planet. The Manatees named this planet after the god of war. Iron oxide on its surface gives the planet its red color.[13] Hence the name Mars. A terrestrial planet whose surface has craters like the Moon and volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and ice-covered polar regions like the Earth. Mars has cycles and seasons similar to Earth's. Mount Olympus, the tallest mountain in the Solar System, and Mariner Valley, one of the largest vertical canyons, are on Mars. Until the successful flyby of Mariner 4 in 1965, Mars was believed to have liquid water on its surface. This belief was attributed to the periodic black and white markings near the polar regions of the planet. They thought that these could be oceans and continents. It was also thought that the long dark scratches seen on the surface could be irrigation canals. This was later interpreted as an optical illusion. However, geological evidence collected by manned missions indicates that Mars once had large amounts of water.[14] It has two moons, Phobosu and Teimosu. They are small and irregular in shape. Like 5261 Eureka, the Martian droid asteroid, these could be asteroids captured by Mars' gravity. Physical Properties The diameter of Mars is half the diameter of Earth. Its density is less than that of Earth. Mars has a mass equal to 15% that of Earth and a mass equal to 11% that of Earth. Its surface area is slightly less than that of Earth's dry land.[7] Mars is also large and imposing on Mercury. But Mercury is denser than Mars. Geology Mars is a terrestrial planet composed of minerals containing silicon, oxygen, metals, and other rock-forming elements. The surface of Mars is composed mostly of tholeiitic limestones.[15] However, some areas have a silica concentration similar to that of common limestones. It can look like the Earth's igneous crystalline rock or silica glass. Areas of low translucency have steeper quartz concentrations, and in the northern region of particular translucency, plate silicas and high-silicon glasses are present in normal concentration. High-silicon pyrocenes occur in detectable quantities in some parts of the southern highlands. Amethyst and olivines are also present here and there.[16] Soil Data from the Phoenix lander show that Martian soil is alkaline and contains elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Found in Earth's gardens, these are essential for plant growth. Soil tests show that the soil has a pH of 8.3 and contains perchlorate salts. Incisors are common on Mars, and new incisors appear on the slopes of craters and valleys. These scratches are initially dark in color and fade in color over time. Sometimes these cracks, which appear to be small, then extend for hundreds of meters. These scratches can also be seen running along the edge of rocks and other obstacles in their path. Liquid water is unlikely to exist on the surface of Mars due to low buoyancy, although water may remain liquid for short periods of time in hydrological lows. The ice caps found at both poles are thought to be composed mostly of water. The water produced by the melting of the ice in the south polar ice cap would be enough to cover the entire surface of Mars by 11 meters. Visible craters on Mars indicate that liquid water may have once existed on its surface. Massive oblong drainage ditches, known as outflow canals, cut across the Martian surface at about 25 locations. These are believed to be traces of landslides caused by the release of water from underground reservoirs that caused the disaster. However, some believe that these may have been caused by glaciers or lava flows. The most recent of these canals appeared only a few million years ago. From the shape of such channel networks found elsewhere, they suggest that these may be runoff marks from early Martian rain or ice. Climate of Mars The surface temperature of Mars ranges from +27 to -126 degrees. (from +58 to -88.3 on Earth). But the average temperature is -48 degrees Celsius because it is farther from the Sun than Earth. Its atmosphere is very thin and contains mostly carbon-dioxide. It looks very red in a telescope. That is why Mars is called the red planet in English. Like Earth, the poles are ice regions. Ice here is mostly carbon-dioxide called 'dry ice'. A large ice crater has also been discovered at the north pole of Mars. As of now (Dec-2018) this ice crater has water surrounding giant icebergs 5,905 feet thick[]. Glacier This glacier was discovered during the European Space Agency's Mars probe. This glacier was caught in its camera when the spacecraft sent to Mars in 2003 was carrying out its research in the north pole of Mars. At the North Pole lies a great canyon, about 50.1 miles long and 1.2 miles wide. It is named as Korolev crater. It is named after the famous aerospace engineer Sergei Korolev. Korolov served as the chief rocket launch engineer on such landmark space exploration projects as Sputnik and Vostok. Beagle2 - Britain's mission to Mars Already in 1997, America's Pathfinder rover landed on Mars. It was decided at a meeting of the European Space Agency (ESA) in December 2000 that Britain's Beagle 2 rover would land on Mars in the Isitis Planitia plain between the ancient hills and the northern plains. Beagle 2 will be launched by ESA's 'Mars Express' rocket in June 2003 from the Baikanur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan (Russia). Beagle2's goal is life on Mars, or has it ever been? To find the final answer to the question. Isitis Plantia is the best place for that, and scientists think there's a good chance Mars might have found its fossils if there was ever life on Mars. Beagle 2 will use 'air bags' to land safely on Mars. When it hits the ground on Mars, these air bags are like a ball and after the MP falls to a stop, the gas inside is released and the vehicle comes out undamaged. Rover - America's other Mars exploration project Aside from the Beagle2 project, the US plans to land two robots on Mars in 2004. Both of these rovers will have equipment to search for water, i.e. water in liquid form, during the Tricycle. If water is in liquid form it can only be between 0 – 100 degrees. Also, since there is oxygen in the water, there are more possibilities for life (from single-celled organisms, bacteria to many types of organisms) to live in it. It is believed that life on earth first appeared in water. Starting with a list of 185 potential landing sites on Mars, the list has now been narrowed down to 30 most important sites. Experts have said that the importance is given to the place where scientific evidence is available rather than the place where it is possible to land without damage. A final decision on the landing site will be made one year prior to launch. American scientists say that the information sent by the spacecraft 'Mars Global Surveyor' currently orbiting Mars is very helpful. Rover mission plans The first rover robot will be launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on May 30, 2003, and the second on June 27 of the same year. It is expected to land on Mars on January 4 and February 8, 2004 respectively. These rovers are currently known as MER-A and MER-B. (MER – Mars Exploration Rover). Both rovers will cover a distance of 100 meters per Tuesday (24.62 hours). These are expected to work even beyond April 2004 if health is good.

"The Nobel Prize or Nobel Prize (old case) is a highly regarded prize awarded worldwide to those who have carried out outstanding research, invented technologies or tools of great utility, and made exceptional contributions to society. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded only to certain organizations. As of March 2005, 770 Nobel Prizes have been awarded. However, some have refused to accept this gift. It was started in 1895 by chemist Alfred Nobel. The first prize was awarded in 1901. There were some years when even a prize was not announced. However, the award will be announced at least once in five years. The Nobel Prize is non-refundable. Alfred Nobel's bequests include physics, chemistry, literature, medicine or physiology, and peace. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was established in 1968 by the Swedish Central Bank to celebrate its 300th anniversary. Each laureate will receive a gold medal and a plaque, as well as prize money based on the Nobel Foundation's income for the year. History Alfred Nobel was born on October 21, 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden. His family was a family of engineers[1]. He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor during his lifetime. In 1894, Nobel bought the Bofors Iron and Steel Works and turned it into a large arms manufacturing plant. He invented the ballistic-arm, a British-made smokeless explosive, and a patent case was filed over it.Nobel made much of his fortune during his lifetime, chief among them dynamite. 2]. In 1888 he was shocked to see his obituary in a French newspaper, ""Death of the Merchant of Death"". But then it was Ludwig, Alfred's brother, who died. But the news left Nobel reeling, and he began to think seriously about how he would be remembered after his death. This led him to rewrite his will.[3] Alfred Nobel died at the age of 63 on December 10, 1895 at San Remo, Italy[4]. To everyone's surprise, Nobel's last will specified that the bulk of his estate be used to award prizes in the fields of physics, chemistry, peace, medicine and literature to those who had contributed to the 'advancement of the human race'[5]. Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. His last will and testament was written and signed by him at the Swedish-Norwegian Forum in Paris on 27 November 1895[6][7]. He bequeathed 94% of his estate, 31 million Swedish kroner (€150 million, US$186 in 2008 values), to five Nobel Prizes.[8] It was only approved by the Norwegian Parliament on April 26, 1897 due to doubts over his will[9]. The executors of Nobel's will, Ragnar Solmann and Rudolf Lieqvist, set up a ""Nobel Foundation"" to transfer his estate and regulate the distribution of prizes.[10] According to Nobel's notes, the Norwegian Nobel Committee was set up to award the Nobel Peace Prize, and its members were chosen within days of the will's approval. After that, committees were also formed to give other prizes. They are the Karolinska Institutet (June 7), the Swedish Society (June 9), and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (June 11).[11] The rules for how the prizes are to be awarded were promulgated in 1900 by King Oscar II, after being approved by the Nobel Foundation.[5] Norway and Sweden separated in 1905. Since then, the responsibility for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize rests with Norway and the responsibility for awarding the other prizes rests with organizations in Sweden.[9] Nobel Foundation The ""Nobel Foundation"" was established as a private corporation on June 29, 1900 to oversee the financial resources and administration of the Nobel Prizes.[12] According to Nobel's will, the foundation's primary duty is to protect the property left by Nobel. Brothers Robert and Ludwig Nobel invested heavily in oil companies in Azerbaijan. Swedish historian E. Barkengren, who personally visited the Nobel family history collections, says that the withdrawal of Nobel's investments from Baku was the initial catalyst for the prize.[13] Another task of the Nobel Foundation is to fund the prize globally and oversee the administration of the prize. The Foundation takes no part in selecting the awardees.[14][15] In many ways the foundation functions as an investment group, investing Nobel's assets to generate funds for the awarding and administration of the prize. Since 1946 the Nobel Foundation has been exempt from all taxes in Sweden. It has been exempt from all taxes in the United States since 1953.[16] Since the 1980s, its investments have been reaping huge returns. As of December 31, 2007, the Nobel Foundation's assets were 3.628 billion Swedish kroner (US$560 million).[17] According to the rules, the foundation will be headquartered in Stockholm. Also, five citizens of Sweden or Norway shall be members of the Foundation. The Chairman of the Trust is elected by the King's Advisory Council. The other four members are elected by the trustees of the organizations that elect Nobel laureates. Among the Trust's members are its Executive Director, one Deputy Director is elected by the King's Advisory Committee, and two Associate Directors are elected by the Foundation's Trustees. However, since 1995 all members are elected by the trustees of the Nobel Prize Organizations. The Director and Deputy Director are elected by the Trustees themselves. Apart from the foundation members, the Nobel Foundation includes all prize-giving bodies (Swedish National Academy of Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Swedish Academy, Norwegian Nobel Institute), their trustees and auditors.[17] First Prizes After the establishment of the Nobel Foundation and its regulations, the Nobel Societies prepared proposals for the first prizes to be awarded. Thereafter the selected lists were sent to the awarding bodies. Adding to the credibility of the prizes, the Norwegian Nobel Society appointed the distinguished Jørgen Løvland, Jørnstjern Jørnsson and Johannes Steen to the prize committee.[18] The Nobel Committee decided to award the prize to two prominent figures from the emerging peace movements of the late 19th century: Frédéric Bassi (co-founder of the League of Nations) and Henry Dunant (founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross).[19][20][21] The Nobel Prize in Physics was chosen by the Nobel Society for two people: William Röntgen, the discoverer of X-rays, and Philip Lennard, the discoverer of cathode rays. The Swedish Academy of Sciences chose Röntgen as its laureate.[19][20][21] By the end of the 19th century, many chemists had made important discoveries and advances. Therefore the awarding body was forced to prepare the merit list as per the award.[22] 20 proposals were placed in this sector. 11 of them were for Jacobus van Gaa.[23] Jacobus van Gaal was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize for his contributions to chemical-thermodynamics.[24][25] Sallie Prudhoem was chosen by the Swedish Society for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. 42 Swedish writers and poets protested against this and expressed their displeasure, believing that Leo Tolstoy would win and was the most deserving of the prize.[26] Some, including Burton Belduman, were of the opinion that Sallie Bruthome was an ordinary poet. Burton Belduman accused the awarding bodies of pretending to be Victorian literary enthusiasts and therefore giving the prize to a Victorian poet.[27] The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to the German physiologist and microbiologist Erich von Behring-Kuch. In the 1890s Erich von Behring discovered the vaccine for diphtheria, and until then thousands of people died from diphtheria every year.[28][29] World War II Adolf Hitler's Third Reich in 1938 and 1939 prevented three Nobel laureates (Richard Kuhn, Adolf Friedrich Johann Beutenant, and Jörghard Tomak) from receiving the prize.[30] However, each later received their diploma and prize.[31] Although Sweden played a neutral role during World War II, the Nobel Prizes were awarded at intervals. No one was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1939. During the period 1940-42, Norway was occupied by Germany and no prize was awarded in any sector. The following year, in addition to the Nobel Prizes for Peace and Literature, others were awarded.[32] Three Nobel Foundation members fled abroad after the capture of Norway. The other Foundation members there would have been under pressure from the Nazis because the Nobel Society had declared that the Nobel House in Oslo was Swedish property. The palace was therefore a refuge from the German army, as Sweden was not at war with Germany.[33] Although the Foundation members there continued to oversee the work of the Nobel Foundation, no prizes were awarded. In 1944 the Nobel Foundation announced that the proposals had been received, including the three members who had escaped abroad, and that the Nobel Peace Prize would continue to be awarded as usual.[30] Prize for Economic Sciences In 1968, the Swedish Central Bank, in celebration of its 300th anniversary, donated a large sum to the Nobel Foundation to establish a prize in Nobel's name. The following year, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded. The Swedish National Academy of Sciences is responsible for selecting the laureates. The first economics prize winners were Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Fritsch. They have ""created and successfully implemented operating models for economic activity,"" noted the Nobel Committee.[34][35] Although not a Nobel Prize, it is identified with other Nobel Prizes. Laureates are announced at the same time as other Nobel laureates are announced. The prize in economics is awarded at the Swedish Nobel Prize ceremony.[36] After the addition of this prize, the Nobel Foundation Committee met and decided not to award any new prizes.[37] Award System The award system is the same for all Nobel Prizes; The main difference is who recommends them individually.[38] Nominations Nomination forms are sent to about 3,000 individuals by the Nobel Committee, usually in September a year before the prizes are awarded. Inquiries for the Nobel Peace Prize are addressed to governments, members of the International Court of Justice, professors and college presidents, former Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of nomination forms is January 31 of the award year. The Nobel Prize Committee will nominate around 300 potential winners from these forms and additional names. The Selection Nobel Prize Committee then produces a report reflecting the advice of experts in relevant fields. This, along with a list of initial candidates, will be submitted to awarding agencies. It meets the selection of laureates in each category by a majority vote. A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected for each award. Apart from the Peace Prize, which can be given to organizations, awards can only be given to individuals. If the Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded, the money will be divided among scientific prizes. This has happened 19 times so far. Award Ceremony All Nobel Prizes, except the Nobel Peace Prize, are presented annually on Nobel's memorial day, December 10, in Stockholm, Sweden. The speech of the prize-winners is usually held on the eve of the event. On the same December 10th, the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony and Laureate Speech will be held in Oslo, Norway. Since Norway and Sweden were a single commonwealth at the time of Alfred Nobel's will, the Peace Prize is awarded in Norway and other prizes in Sweden. The event and the festivities surrounding it have recently become a global phenomenon. Nobel Prize and Tamils ​​Three Tamils ​​have won the Nobel Prize so far. These proud people W. Rama (1930), Subramanian Chandrasekhar (1983), Venkatraman Ramakrishnan (2009).

"India has 29 states and 7 union territories including the National Capital Territory of Delhi. All states and union territories have popularly elected governments in Pondicherry and the Delhi Capital Territory. Other Union Territories are directly governed by the President, with Governors appointed by the Central Government. In 1956, linguistic states were created under the States Reorganization Act. After that, some new states were formed in the northern parts of India. States and Union Territories are divided into small administrative units called districts. States and Union Territories of Andhra Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh Assam Bihar Chhattisgarh Goa Gujarat Ariana Himachal Pradesh Jammu and Kashmir Jharkhand Karnataka Kerala Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Manipur Meghalaya Mizoram Nagaland Orissa Punjab Rajasthan Sikkim Tamil Nadu Telangana Tripura Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand West Bengal Union Territories called Union Territories: Andaman and Nicobar Islands Chandigarh Dadra and Nagar Haveli Daman, Theu Lakshadweep Delhi Puducherry States and their Capitals Formation of Indian States British India comprised of present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan consisted of two sub-political units. The provinces were directly governed by British officers of the rank of Governor or Special Commissioner, appointed by the Viceroy. The princely states were ruled by local hereditary rulers who accepted British suzerainty. British India consisted of 15 provinces: Ajmer-Merwara, Assam, Baluchistan, Bengal, Bihar, Bombay, Central Provinces, Berar, Coorg, Delhi, Madras, North-West Frontier, Orissa, Punjab, Sind, and United Provinces. In British India, there were many princely states of varying sizes. These ranged from Hyderabad, with a population of over a crore, to much smaller princely states. Apart from these, two other European countries occupied some territories in India. Portuguese India included the coastal territories of Goa, Taman and Diu, Tatra and Nagar Haveli, and French India included the five territories of Sundernagar, Enam, Pondicherry, Karaikal and Maghe. During the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, these provinces and princely states were divided between the two countries. Only Punjab and Bengal were divided on religious lines. Although Hyderabad's Islamic ruler tried to remain independent, the Indian army intervened and annexed it to India. Both countries claim Jammu and Kashmir. Majority of the people were Muslims. The Hindu ruler of Jammu and Kashmir annexed the country to India. In 1950, the Constitution of India came into force and various states were formed. Formerly provinces, Category A states were governed by a governor and an elected assembly. The nine states included in this category are: Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Bombay, Madhya Pradesh (formerly Central Provinces and Berar), Madras, Orissa, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh (formerly United Provinces). There was a demand among the people to separate the Telugu speaking areas from the Chennai province and create a separate state of Andhra Pradesh. As part of this request Poti Siriramalu was resurrected after fasting for 58 days. Andhra Pradesh was created as a separate state on October 1, 1953 to put an end to the riots that followed. In the same year, the State Reorganization Commission was constituted with Basal Ali as Chairman and Panicker, Kunzuru as members. This commission advised to organize the states on the basis of language. On the recommendations of this committee, the States Reform Act was passed in 1956. India was divided into 14 states. Gujarat was separated from Maharashtra (1960) on the same basis. In later years many more states were formed. Nagaland in 1963, Ariana in 1966, Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur in 1972, Sikkim in 1975, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Goa in 1987. In 2000, three more states namely Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand were formed. The state of Telangana was created from Andhra Pradesh in 2014 and is the 29th state of India.

"The human brain is the head of the human nervous system and the most complex of human organs. The human brain controls unconscious, involuntary activities such as breathing, digestion, heartbeat, and yawning[1],[2] and complex higher-order activities that occur consciously, such as thinking, understanding, and reasoning. The human brain is capable of handling such complex high-level operations better than any other living organism. Although the human brain resembles the general shape of other mammalian brains in many ways, it is at least five times larger in body weight-to-brain volume ratio than their brains. This is due to the well-developed cerebral cortex of the human brain. Formed by neural tissue and consisting of several series of folds, this region is located in the human forebrain. In particular, the frontal lobes of the brain, which are responsible for the specialized functions that distinguish humans from other animals, such as self-control, planning, reasoning, and learning, are well developed in the human brain. Also, the area responsible for eye sight is also well developed in the human brain. In the evolution of the brain, the ratio of brain-body size has gradually increased from the earliest small mammal, the primate, through the great ape to one of the higher animals, man; This is called encephalisation. Of the approximately 50–100 billion (5000–10000 million) neurons (1011) in the human brain, approximately 10 billion neurons (1010) are cortical pyramidal cells. These cells use approximately 100 trillion (1014) synapses to send signals (signals) between them. The human brain is protected by the thick bones of the skull, the cerebrospinal fluid, from vibrations and external damage, and from the blood and blood-borne diseases through the blood-brain barrier system. However, due to its delicate nature, it is inevitable that it will be harmed by various diseases and damages. Common types of brain damage include closed head injuries, head injuries, strokes caused by blood clots in the brain, and exposure to chemical toxins called neurotoxins. Suffering from brain infections is extremely rare. Because the blood-brain barrier in the human brain filters out most of the bacterial germs that can enter the bloodstream and attack the body's organs, the brain is largely protected from infectious microbes. However, when the brain is rarely attacked by bacteria, treatment with antibodies becomes more difficult. This is because the same blood-brain barrier system also blocks the immune system. Viruses can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. These jump together with the white blood cells in the blood. Apart from these, many common genetic diseases can also affect the brain. Among them, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, in which the body's immune system attacks the nervous system, are important. Psychological diseases such as depression, low mood and cognitive impairment are also caused by changes in the brain. An average male brain weighs about 1.5 kilograms,[3] and has a volume of 1260 cubic centimeters. The female brain is approximately 1130 cubic centimeters (cc).[4] When a person is alive, the outer surface of the brain is dark gray and the inner mass is yellow and white. The photograph on the right shows a horizontal cross-section through the middle of the brain. In this image, the cerebral cortex (the convoluted area) and the white matter can be seen. Millions of myelinated fibers connect the white matter and the cerebral cortex. The total length of the myelin fibers in the brain of a 20-year-old male is about 176,000 kilometers. The total length of myelin fibers in the female brain at the same age is about 149,000 kilometers.[5] At the top of the brain, the convoluted cerebral cortex is divided into two hemispheres, known as the cerebral hemispheres. This region is the largest part of the brain.[6] The part of the stem that lies below the cerebral hemispheres and joins them is called the brainstem. At the back of the brain, below the cerebral cortex, the area behind the brainstem is known as the cerebellum. This region is distinguished from other parts of the brain by its horizontal groove-like structure. The cerebellum, also found in other mammalian species, is one of the smallest parts of the brain. Also, as a general rule, the smaller an organism's cerebellum, the less convoluted its cerebral cortex is. An example of this is that the cerebral cortex of rat and hamster is smooth without folds. Whales and dolphins, the largest mammals, have more folds in the cerebral cortex than humans. A distinctive feature of the human brain is the enormous cerebral cortex. Being so large in humans, it appears to completely cover the rest of the brain. The human cerebellum is larger than that of other mammals. Human cerebral cortex plays a major role not only in size but also in brain function. For example, a mouse can walk, eat, and sense external changes even after its cerebral cortex has been surgically removed. But a person whose cerebral cortex is damaged will go into a permanent coma. The cerebral cortex is divided into roughly equal right-left hemispheres. Anatomists divide each hemisphere into four lobes. They are frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe. It is noteworthy that the names of these sections are arranged according to the names of the cranial bones adjacent to the sections. The cerebral cortex is shaped like a broad sheet of neural tissue folded into several folds and compressed into a narrow skull. The area of ​​the neuron in each cerebral hemisphere when unfolded is about 1.3 square feet.[7] Anatomists refer to the groove formed by these folds as a sulcus, and the smooth area between each groove as a gyrus. Although the folds of all humans generally have approximately the same shape, the differences are markedly distinct with some variation in shape and location of values. However, some large folds can be found in all mandarins. Different regions of the cerebral cortex have the ability to learn and govern different cognitive abilities (eg, seeing, hearing, feeling). This can be confirmed in various ways: damage to a specific part of the brain, affecting only a specific sense, special design of the magnetic resonance imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a specific sense and the brain that governs it. Identifying the specific region and examining the fibrous structure of the cerebral cortex is significant. According to anatomists, the cerebral cortex can be divided into about 6 layers with the aid of a microscope. However, it is not possible to separate these layers in all parts of the brain. Many anatomists have diagrammed these layers in the cortex. Brodmann, who is known as the first among them, classified the different parts of the brain into 52 sections. (Later anatomists divided it into many more subdivisions). Topographic Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is a motor cortex located in the anterior margin of the central sulcus as shown in Fig. The motor cortex is the part of the body that sends commands to the voluntary muscles of the body. The diagram on the right shows that the primary motor cortex, one of the motor cortexes of the brain, organizes the movement control areas of the body parts sequentially. In other words, in the order in which the parts of the body are located, first the feet, followed by the legs, thighs, and abdomen, in the same order, their control areas are set up in the brain. Doctors have also found that when an area of ​​the cortex is electrically stimulated, the muscles of the organ that the area controls tighten. However, each organ is controlled by varying degrees of cortical neuron. For example, the cortical afferents that control organs in the human head are three times larger than the cortical afferents that control the spine. The more dense (larger) the cortical nerve fibers that control an organ, the greater the motor control and sensory perception of that organ. Because of this, the human lips, tongue, fingers, and facial muscles are small but perform many fine functions (eg, tongue, lips - speaking) and the amount of cortical nerve fibers representing them is large. Visual cortex The cortical neural structures for human vision are similar to those of the retina at the back of the eye. Each retinal nerve cell, which transforms the light reaching the human eye into vision, is represented by certain cortical neurons in this area. In particular, neurons in the center of the retina (with greater emphasis on objects in the center of vision) are allocated more visual cortical neurons than neurons at the periphery of the retina. The visual cortex in the cerebral cortex contains hundreds of different retinotopic maps to examine the appearance of a scene falling on the retina from different angles. Through these, an appearance is examined from multiple angles simultaneously and a final decision is made. The primary visual cortex (section 17 of Brodmann's classification) receives nerve impulses from the eye directly via the thalamus. This region is able to easily extract the main characteristics (visual features) from the received images. The forebrain represents the two large chambers of the spherical, gray matter in the forebrain. These transmit impulses from the senses to the cerebral cortex. The visual cortex detects the color, motion, speed, and shape of objects in the scene after the primary visual cortex. Auditory cortex The auditory sensory region consists of tonotopic maps organized in a spatial tonality pattern. The left-brain tone system means that each different tone (sound frequency) heard by humans excites a different area of ​​the auditory cortex. In short, it means spatially tuning the frequency of the tone. The total combination of excitations occurring in different parts of the auditory cortex produces a word. Sounds are distinguished by the frequency they produce (ie, high pitch or low pitch). Like the visual system, the auditory region has more than one tonotopic cortical map. Each draft requires a different approach to sound. Verbal mapping Verbal mapping involves identifying each control area of ​​the brain and the functions of the organ it controls and mapping them to each other. Each hemisphere of the brain controls a part of the body. Also, it is noteworthy that the right brain controls the left side of the body and the left brain controls the right side of the body. In the same way, the motor connections and sensory connections between the brain and the spinal cord, in the middle of the brainstem, shift from right to left and from left to right. Technical terms frontal lobe - frontal lobe parietal lobe temporal lobe - lateral lobe occipital lobe cerebellum - cerebellum cerebral hemispheres - cerebral hemispheres cerebral - brain cortex cerebral cortex - cerebral cortex nerve tissue myelinated fiber white matter - white matter gray matter closed head injuries - internal head injuries brain stem - brain stem coma - unconsciousness sulcus - furrow gyrus - crest functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI - functional magnetic resonance imaging primary motor cortex thalamus - forebrain chamber hypothalamus - hypothalamus See also these Body parts With a human skull spinal cord Read more quotes Unknown parameter |coauthors= ignored (|author= suggested) (help) Unknown parameter |coauthors= ignored (|author= suggested) (help) Unknown parameter |coauthors= ignored (|author= suggested) (help) Unknown parameter |coauthors= ignored (|author= suggested) (help) Unknown parameter |coauthors= ignored (|author= suggested) (help); Cite journal requires |journal= (help) Simon, Seymour (1999).

"Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar (Urdu: جلال الدين محمد اكبر, Jalal ud-Din Muhammad Akbar), or Emperor Akbar (15 October 1542 – 27 October 1605),[3][4] was the ruler of the Mughal Empire from 1556 until his death. Born to Himayun and Hamida Banu, Akbar came to power in his 13th generation after the death of his father, King Nasiruddin Humayun. He is considered to be the most famous of the kings of the Mughal Empire. His original name was Jalaluddin Akbar [5][6]. During his reign he defeated the military attacks of the descendants of Afghan King Sher Shah Suri. Mughal forces defeated Hemu, a general of the Sur Empire in India, at Panipat in Samar in 1556.[7][8][9] Emperor Akbar married princesses from powerful Rajput families, thereby strengthening their friendship.[8][10] Akbar was a great artist. He was a great warrior, an artist, skilled in carpentry, butchering, and skilled in storing and handling weapons of war. He was not only an emperor but also a broad minded man. He is a great inventor. A good animal trainer. During his reign he trained thousands of feral cats to be the best on their own. He is a master of fine combat boot tapes. He was also a great technologist and philosopher.[11] His service to the arts is something that will be told for ages. Akbar made way to compile many literatures into one collection. They include Akbar Nama Ayini Akbari etc. He also managed to compile information about the various arts that arrived on the Mughal route. He built many famous structures with many artistic touches. He built the first house made of straw. [11] Akbar conducted religious debates between Sikhs, Muslim scholars and Hindus. He argued with the sectarians and with the Jesuits from Portugal and Islamic scholars. He named his new religious doctrine ""Deen Ilahi"". It means ""divine faith"". This religion had unique principles. After him these religious principles disappeared. His wife followed this religious principle after Akbar's death.[8][12] The name Akbar was born when Akbar Badrudin was called Muhammad Akbar. He was so called because he was born at Poornami = night. Badru means full moon in Arabic) Akbar's birth date and birth name were changed after he brought Humayun Kabul under his control. The name was changed to ward off evil spirits.[13] Akbar means ""greatest"" in Arabic. Actually the name Akbar was given after his maternal grandfather, Sahid Ali Akbar Jami. Youth Emperor Akbar was born on October 15, 1542 in the Rajput fort of Amarkot in Sindh, present day Pakistan. Then the Mughal Emperor Umayun and Umayun's younger wife Hamida Banu took refuge there. Umayun had fled the country after losing a battle with the Pashtun (Afghanistan) leader Sher Shah Suri.[14] Akbar did not accompany his parents when Umayun and his wife went to Persia. He grew up in the village of Mukundpur in the Rewa region of what is now Madhya Pradesh. Akbar and Prince Ram Singh grew up as good friends during their youth. Later Ram Singh became the Maharaja of Rewa. Both remained good friends till the end. After some time Akbar moved to the then Safavid Empire which is part of present day Afghanistan. There he was brought up by his uncle Askaria. Akbar had learned to hunt, run and fight in his youth. But did not learn to read and write. This is what distinguished him from Babur.[15] Despite this, Akbar turned out to be a very knowledgeable ruler. He was a great ruler with arts, architecture, music, literature, romance and a broad vision that supported the opinion of others. In the chaos that followed the accession of Islam Shah (Sher Khan Suri's son), Umayun recaptured Delhi in 1555. He led a part of the Persian army sent by Shah Tahmas and won. Umayun died after a few months. Bairam Khan tactfully covered up Umayun's death for a few days to make preparations for Akbar's accession. Akbar succeeded his father on February 14, 1556 Gregorian year. It took place in the midst of a war with Sikandar Shah to restore the Mughal Empire. 13-year-old Akbar was crowned by Bairam Khan at Kalanowr in Punjab. Akbar, dressed in gold, was seated on a newly erected dais.[16] Akbar was proclaimed Shahanshah (meaning ""king"" in Persian). Early Successes of Akbar's Reign Akbar was determined to remove the threat from the Shersha dynasty. And Sikandar Shah of Punjab, the strongest of the three, had decided to defeat Suri's army. Akbar gave Delhi under the rule of Dirty Baig Khan. Sikandar Shah Suri never gave any trouble. Akbar often repelled him with force whenever he approached. Despite this, the Hindu king Hemu alias Hemu Vikramaditya attacked Delhi on October 6, 1556 and occupied Agra. Later he occupied Delhi as well. He proclaimed himself the Emperor of India. Dirty Bike Con ran out of town. Hemu Vikramaditya won 22 consecutive victories from October 1553 to October 1556. Instead of calling himself emperor or ""Raja Vikramaditya"", he created a Hindu kingdom. Information soon reached Akbar about the occupation of Delhi. Akbar was advised to leave Kabul. But on the insistence of Bairam Khan, Akbar rushed to capture Delhi. To cheer up the crew, he ordered that someone should light a fire and perform aerial stunts to cheer up the troops. Not only that, he took the form of Hemu and ordered it to be filled with gunpowder and set on fire. Dirty Bike and his henchmen join Akbar. They advised Akbar to go to Kabul and withdraw the army. But Akbar refused. Seeing the cowardice of Dirty Bike, Bairam Khan, with the help of Abdul Basil and Jahangir, fixed him up. Abdul Basil and Jahangir believed that Bairam Khan's capitulation was to drive away the enemy. Akbar's army defeated various forces of Hemu Vikramaditya in the Second Battle of Panipat in North Delhi. By chance an arrow hit Hemu in the eye. Hemu was brought unconscious and beheaded. According to some sources Bairam Khan killed Hemu but Akbar used the word Ghazi and killed Hemu. The word Ghazi means warrior of faith. This term was used by Akbar's grandfather Timur to his father Babur when fighting against the Hindus. Hemu's body was dismembered. His head was hanged outside the darwasha of Delhi. Hemu's mantle was hung outside the purana quilla. It is opposite the present Pragati Maidan in Delhi. Appointing himself as the cause of the victory, Akbar erected a victory pillar bearing the heads of the surrendered king Hemachandra Vikramaditya and the heads of the mutinous soldiers, using the term Ghazi. This he did as Babur did. Such pictures are kept in the National Museum in New Delhi. Akbar is said to have acquired 1,500 war elephants from this victory and used them as a bastion of Mankot along with Sikandarsha. Sikandar is said to have surrendered and was later killed. It is also said that Sikandar spent his last two years in a compound with vast tracts of farmland given to him by Akbar. Adil Shah, Sikandar Shah's brother was killed in a battle in Bengal in 1557. பைராம் கான் அக்பர் ஆட்சி பொறுப்பை ஏற்கும் போது 13 வயது நிரம்பியவராக இருந்தார்.ஆதலால் அவருடைய படைத்தளபதி அவர் சார்பாக அக்பர் குறித்த வயது வரும் வரை ஆட்சி பொறுப்பை நடத்தினார். பைராம் கான் பாதக்ஷானின் டர்கி மொழி பேசும் இனத்தவரான அவர் அக்பரின் அரசாட்சிக்கு ஏமாற்றுகாரர்களால் ஏற்பட்ட இடையூறுகளை வெற்றிகரமாக கையாண்டார் . மொகலாய படையை முன்னேற்றப்பாதையில் ஒழுங்குபடுத்தினார். அவர் ஆட்சி பொறுப்பு பொதுவாக ஓர் இடத்தில் நடுநாயகமாக வைக்கப்பட்டு மற்றும் எல்லை விரிவாக்கங்கள் தலை நகரின் கட்டளைப்படி நடை பெறவும் உறுதி செய்தார். இந்த நடைமுறைகள் மொகலாய அரசின் புதிய பகுதிகளை ஒருங்கிணைப்பதற்கு உதவியது. இருந்த போதிலும் பைராம் கானின் செயல்களுக்கு ஒட்டு மொத்தமாக மரியாதை இல்லை. பல பேர் அவரின் முடிவை குறித்து கொண்டிருந்தார்கள். அவரின் நேரடியான ஆட்சி பொறுப்பை கை பிடிப்பதற்க்காக அவ்வாறு செய்தார்கள். அவருடைய மதத்தை பற்றி மிகவும் அதிகமாக எழுத்துக்கள் மூலம் விமர்சிக்கப்பட்டது . பெரும்பாலும் சன்னி முஸ்லிம் இனத்தவரை கொண்டு ஆரம்ப கால நீதி மன்றங்கள் இயங்கின, மற்றும் பை ராமின் சியா கொள்கை வெறுக்கப்பட்டது. பைராம் அதை அறிந்தவராக இருந்தார். இருந்த போதிலும் அதை தடுப்பதற்க்காக சியா ஷேக் கடை என்பவரை அரசுக்கு நிர்வாக தளபதியாக, மிகவும் அதிகமான முக்கியத்துவம் நிறைந்த பணியாக கருதப்படும் பணியில் நியமித்தார். மேலும் பைராம் ஒரு ஆடம்பரமான வாழ்க்கையை, அக்பரை காட்டிலும் அதிக செலவுள்ள ஆடம்பரமான வாழ்கையை வாழ்ந்தார். பைராமை கடுமையாக எதிர்த்தவர்களில் அக்பரின் அத்தையும் தலைமை தாதிகையுமான மகம் அங்கா மற்றும் அக்பரின் வளர்ப்பு தாயின் மகனுமான ஆதாம் கானும் அடங்குவார்கள். மகம் கூர்மையாகவும் கட்டுப்பாடு உடையவராகவும் கருதப்பட்டார் மற்றும் ஆட்சியை தனது மகன் மூலம் நடத்த முடியும் என்று நம்பினார். மார்ச் 1560 - ல் இருவரும் அக்பரை சந்திப்பதற்கு நிர்பந்ததித்தார்கள். பைராமை ஆக்ராவில் விட்டு விட்டு டெல்லியில் சந்திக்கும்படி வழி வகை செய்தார்கள். அக்பர் மக்களால் முழு ஆட்சி அதிகாரத்தை கையில் எடுப்பதற்கு வலியுறுத்தப்பட்டார், மற்றும் பைராம்கானை ஆட்சி அதிகாரத்திலிருந்து நீக்கவும் வலியுறுத்தப்பட்டார். அக்பர் பைராமின் ஹஜ் புனித யாத்திரையான மெக்காவிற்கு செல்வதற்க்காக செலவு செய்வதற்கு வலியுறுத்தப்பட்டார். அது முக்கியமாக பைராமை நாட்டை விட்டு துரத்தும் செயலை செயல்படுத்தவதற்கு செய்யப்பட செயல் ஆகும். பைராம் டெல்லியில் இருந்து வந்த இந்த செய்தியை கேட்டு கொதிப்படைந்தார். இருந்த போதிலும் அக்பருக்கு விசுவாசமானவராக இருந்தார். அக்பர் படைத்தளபதியை சந்திப்பதற்கு மறுத்த போதிலும் ஆதாம் கானால் அனுப்பப்பட்ட ராணுவ படையை சந்தித்தார். இந்த படை அக்பரின் அனுமதியோடு அனுப்பப்பட்டது. இந்த படை மொகலாய பகுதிகளிலிருந்து அவரை பாதுகாப்பதற்கு அனுப்பப்பட்டது. பைராம் இதை கடைசி வாய்ப்பாக பார்த்து, படையை தாக்கினார். ஆனால் அவரை பிடித்து அக்பரின் முன் துரோகத்திர்க்காக குற்ற தண்டனை பெறுவதற்க்காக நிறுத்தப்பட்டார். பைராம் கானின் ராணுவ மேதைத்தனம் மொகலாயர்கள் இந்தியாவில் நிலங்களை ஆட்கொள்வதற்கு உதவி செய்தது. பைராம் கான் ஹுமாயுன் மற்றும் அக்பருக்கு விசுவாசத்தோடு நடந்து கொண்டார். அதன் மூலம் ஒரு வலிமையான அரசாங்கம் உருவாதற்கு வழி வகை செய்தார். ஆனால் இப்போது அக்பர் முன்பு ஒரு சிறை கைதியாக ஆகி உள்ளார். மகம் அங்கா அக்பருக்கு பைராமை கொல்லும்படி வலியுறுத்தினார். அங்காவின் வலியுறுத்தல் இருந்த போதிலும் அக்பர் தனது படை தளபதிக்கு முழு மரியாதை கொடுத்தார். அவருக்கு மரியாதை சிறப்புகள் செய்தார். அவருக்கு முறையான ஹஜ் யாத்திரை செய்வதற்கு வேண்டிய பண உதவிகளை செய்வதற்கு ஒத்து கொண்டார். இருந்த போதிலும் பைராமின் ஹஜ் யாத்திரையை தொடர்ந்து ,பைராம் காம்பாட் துறைமுக நகரத்தை அடையும் முன்பு ஆப்கான் கொலையாளியால் கொல்லப்பட்டார். அந்த ஆப்கான் கொலையாளியின் தந்தை ஐந்து வருடங்களுக்கு முன்பு பைராம்மால் வழி நடத்தி செல்லப்பட்ட ஒரு யுத்தத்தில் கொலை செய்யப்பட்டார். பைராம் ஜனவரி 31, 1561 அன்று இறந்தார். Expansion Akbar said, ""A king should aim at victory. He should make his neighbors fear and bear arms. The expansion of the Mughal empire included Malwa (1562), Gujarat (1572), Bengal (1574), Kabul (1581), Kashmir and Kashmir. (1586) and Khandesh (1601) were among other conquests.Akbar appointed a governor under his authority in each province he conquered. Akbar did not want his court to be close to the urban part of Delhi. He ordered the court to be shifted to Badepur Sikri near Agra. But as this place could not be used due to the inadequacy of the place, he set up a team to learn what was going on in the city. He expanded trade and encouraged it. Akbar's tax policies are very noteworthy. Successive generations of the Mughal Empire acquired a strong economic system through this. Their officials kept a detailed land document clearly and precisely detailing each plot's soil quality, water availability, etc., and determining their value depending on the availability and use of various other plants. This was a clear improvement over earlier land tax systems such as the Egyptian and Roman systems. Earlier taxation systems included land taxes as an inherent part of harvest. Akbar's new land tax brought about two kinds of improvement: it recognized the value of land, encouraged investments in land, and made greater use of land's productive potential. The Qing, an emperor revered for economic progress, took a similar step in China a hundred years later and achieved a similar success. Badepur Sikri In 1571, Akbar built the walled capital city of ""Badepur Sikri"" (Badepur means head of victory) near Agra, where he created large artificial lakes and lavish water-filled grounds for Akbar's eldest wives. However, the city was soon abandoned and the capital moved to Lahore, perhaps because the water supply of Badepur Sikri was insufficient or of poor quality. Or, according to many historians, Akbar had to move to the north-west of his kingdom. So it is said that he shifted his capital to the north-west. In 1599 Akbar again shifted his capital to Agra. He ruled from there until his death. The Nine Jewels of Akbar's Court - Abul Basal - He was Akbar's vizier and the author of the Akbar Nama, an authoritative account of Akbar's reign in three chapters. The third authority is called Ayni Akbari and is a translation from the dialect of Persia.[17] He was Baisi's brother and Akbar's courtier. Baisi was a prominent poet in Akbar's court. He was the brother of Akbar's biographer Abul Basal. He wrote beautiful poetry in Persian language. According to his contemporaries, he is said to have written nearly 100 poetical works. He was to create five literary collections called Panch Kanch, like the Persian poet Neshami. But he died after completing three literatures for five. He eventually produced Nal U Daman, Maksan Yul-Atwar and Bilgiswa Salman. These corresponded to Neshami's Layla wa Manjun, Maskan yul-Azr and Shirinwa Khusrau. Akbar highly respected his genius and appointed him as his son's tutor. He gave him a place among the nine Navaratnams in his court. Nine Navaratnams are known as ""Now Gems"". He wrote a commentary on the Qur'an and translated the Sanskrit mathematical literature Lilavati into Persian. His father Mubarak Nagori was a philosopher and scholar of Greek literature and Islamic philosopher. Mian Tansen – A musician in Akbar's court. He is considered as the greatest music composer. He is an extraordinarily gifted singer in nature. He is a composer of many singing genres. He is also a musician. He popularized the instrumental music called Rap (originated in Central Asia). Birbal, in a highly respected position with the government, oversaw Akbar's administration at the Mughal court. He was one of Akbar's most trusted figures. Apart from Akbar, Deen Ilahi was the only person in Akbar's court who did not believe in religion. Birbal managed the military and administration at Akbar's court. And he was Akbar's best friend. Akbar held Birbal in high esteem for his intelligence and sense of humor. They thus humorously exchanged information about them and related matters that were told as stories in the culture. These transactions and stories have become unique expressions of the values ​​of the culture and their pride. Raja Todar Mal - He was promoted to finance minister in Akbar's court. Dodar Mal repaired the financial condition of Akbar's Mughal government. He belonged to the Khatri (Kateree/Kateri) community of Punjab. Todar Mall showed an improvement in the principle of Shersha's work with his expertise. Raja Mansingh – was a Kachaka Raja of Amber, now known as Jaipur. He was Akbar's trusted military commander. Despite this he was a devotee of Sri Krishna. Akbar did not follow Deen Ilahi religion. Abdul Rahim Khan-il-Khana- He was a scholar and (diwan) in Akbar's court and was one of Akbar's nine important ministers known as Akbar's Navaratnams. He was also known for writing two-line poems in Hindi and books on astrology.[18] The village Kankana named after him is located in the Nawanshar district of the northwestern Indian state of Punjab. Baqeer Azio Din- (Baqeer means sage or control in Urdu) – is considered to be one of Akbar's inner circle and a key advisor. Akbar considered his advice very valuable. Mullo Do Piaza - One of the chief advisors of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Akbar took his advice into great consideration and considered him one of the nine jewels of the Mughal Empire known as the Nine Navaratnams.He was known for his intelligence. He was a very close competitor to Birbal. But in the end he lost. Distinctions Akbar was a wise ruler and a good judge of measures. His son and successor Jahangir speaks highly of Akbar in his commemorative works and illustrates his qualities through numerous anecdotes.[19] According to Jahangar, Akbar likened the yellow color of wheat. Antony de Manserrat, a Catholic Christian who saw Akbar's cabinet, claims that Akbar was white. Akbar was not very tall but powerful, efficient and alert.He was known for many forms of heroism. An incident occurred when Akbar was 19 on his way back to Agra from Malwa. Akbar had advanced past his bodyguards. Then a tigress and her cubs came out of the bush and crossed Akbar's path. It is said that the emperor killed the tigress with a single blow when she pounced. His accompanying guards saw the emperor standing quietly beside the dead tigress.[20] A similar incident happened when Par Mal (Prince of Ambur of the Rajput state) accompanied by his son and grandson and his dependents went to a very valuable place near the elephants to pay royal respect to Akbar. Abul Bazal and the highly critical Badauni criticize Akbar as a mighty man. He was well known for his fighting prowess and bravery. Like Alexander of Macedon, he was always willing to risk his life regardless of the political situation. During the rainy season he often takes his horse into a flooded river and crosses it safely. It is said that he was very affectionate towards his relatives. He forgave his brother and rebel Hakim. But only in a few cases did he deal harshly with the criminals. He was harsh on some occasions with his maternal uncle Mussam and foster brother Adam Khan. He was very regular in his diet. Ayini Akbari states that Akbar drank the water of the Ganges while traveling or staying. Akbar described the waters of the Ganges as indestructible. Special persons were arranged to stay at Soran and Haridwar to fill water in sealed kujas and send it to Akbar.[21] According to Jahangir's memoirs, Akbar had a fondness for fruits and a slight interest in meats. Later he says he stopped eating meat in his later years. He enjoyed religious tolerance more than his predecessors and later kings. Written by Jahangir. He says that in this vast divine world there are different ways of loving different types and followers of different religious faiths. Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims met in a prayer hall. Christians of the Bronx and Jus types also met in a church where they worshiped in the form of prayer.[19] According to his theory of language impairment, speech comes from hearing. He said that children who are allowed to remain speechless become isolated and become completely speechless as they age.[22] Akbar was the third generation Mughal king who ruled from 1542-1605 AD. He lived in the period of Akbar is hailed as the greatest of all Mughal kings for his impartiality and character. Relations with Hindus Akbar's reign is best described in his court Abul Basal's Akbar Nama and Ayini Akbar. Abul Bazal gives a very good impact on many historical facts which are wrongly written by the authors, that too in a very boastful way about the king's rule and his relations with the rest of the community. Other contemporaries such as Badayuni, Shaykh Shada Razidi and Shaykh Ahmad Sirundi wrote without regard to contemporary influence. These therefore give less credit to Akbar. Historian Vincent A. Smith concludes that critics who give less credit to Akbar are foolishly intolerant of Akbar's intended good deeds for his conquerors.[23] Akbar's Rajput Wives Akbar appeased the Rajput Raja Parmal of Amer (present-day Jaipur) by agreeing to marry his daughter Harga Bai. This marriage was a very important turning point according to historical traces. Because this marriage is the most luxurious marriage in India between Hindus and Muslims. Harkabai became a Christian as Mariam-Yush-Shamani. After her marriage she was considered a low caste by her family. He never saw Amber/Jaipur during his 61 years of marriage.[24] His position in the Mughal household was one of little importance and he was not given any important responsibility either in Agra or Delhi. Despite this, a very small village was given near Payana in Bharatpur district. He spent his life there till his death.[24] He died in 1623 and his tomb is near Agra. Rajput women convert to Islam after entering the lavish court of Delhi and are buried in Muslim cemeteries. They cannot see their parents or eat with them after marriage. [59] A mosque was subsequently built in Lahore, Pakistan by Jahangir in honor of Maryam-ush-Shamani. It is known as Maryam-ush-Shamani Mosque.[25] She was given the name because she was supposed to be a Muslim queen who would give birth to a Muslim king. Successive royal successions in the Hindu system were always encouraged to be Hindus. Hence there was no threat in Hindu lineage to marry Hindu princesses for political reasons. Although the Rajputs never gave their daughters to the Mughal kings, they respected the Mughals as equals. They never dined with the Mughals or accepted Muslim women as their formal wives.[26] Two Rajput kings were always against Akbar. Sisothiyas of Mewar and Hadas (Chauhans) of Ranthambore. Another turning point in Akbar's reign was when Raja Man Singh I of Amar went to Akbar to meet Surjan Hata, the leader of the Hata, for a friendly ceremony. Surjan half-heartedly agreed to the friendship on one condition. The condition was that Akbar agreed to the friendship if his daughters were not married. Surjan later shifted his residence to Banaras. Surjan Hata's son Bhoja Hata objected to his granddaughter's marriage. (His daughter's daughter Atavad was married to Prince Jagat Singh, son of Man Singh I). Bhoj decided to go against Jahangir regarding his granddaughter's marriage to Jahangir.[27] After Bhoj's death his granddaughter was married to Jahangir and a daughter of Raja Man Singh was also married to Jahangir. But the daughter committed suicide.[28] Rajput dignitaries did not want their kings to marry Mughal daughters. Rathore Kalyandas intimidated Moda Raja Udai Singh into killing him (Jodhpur) and also intimidated Jahangir. Because Udaisingh Rathore had decided to marry Jodha Singh, the daughter of Kalyandas, to Jahangir. Akbar on hearing this sent his valuable forces to attack Kalyandas at Sivana. Killed themselves along with Kalyandas and the men and women of his Shivana forces.[29] Akbar extended his territory far and wide by establishing relations with the Rajput kingdom. Rajput kings resisted the Mughal Empire for 130 years. They continued to oppose Aurangzeb until the fall of the Mughal Empire following his death. Akbar trusted the Rajputs a lot. Because he held the Rajputs captured by him for a long time with respect and affection (like an elder son). However Maharana Pratap Singh of Mewar refused to accept Akbar's authority. Rana Pratap Singh opposed Akbar till his end. He regarded Akbar as a foreigner. Pratap Rajput stopped giving his daughters to the Mughals and sending Rajput soldiers to help. The Marwar and Amber (who had a custom of giving away their daughters to the Mughals) could not control the custom, and the Rajasthani minorities bravely became subordinate officers of Delhi. But all these were the ones who scared Pratap. Envy and hatred arose within the Rana's army by recruiting more soldiers. So they were inactive in matters of concern. Every prince in a Hindu dynasty who deviated from the principles ceased to enter into matrimonial alliances with that caste. To give full credit to Pratap, it must be said that he refused to marry the Rajputs not only with the Mughal kingdom but also with their sister kingdoms Marwar and Amber. The Rajput kings were Bhukat According to Singh and Sawai Jai Singh's letters, Gadu, the old principle of matrimony, took the Rajputs to the heights of fame. Mewar traced its path to destruction by adhering to the old system of marriage. Therefore, the principle of marriage should be purified. He said that there should be the purpose of creating Rajputs and when this system comes into practice, if the Rajputs give up the old policy. (giving their women to the Mughals).This old marriage policy created disunity among the Rajputs.[30] Protected Hindu temples were defaced when Akbar gave a golden umbrella to an idol. He agreed to convert the mosque into a Hindu temple. The temple was earlier destroyed and converted into a mosque.[31] Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a contemporary of Akbar, did not praise Akbar for protecting the temples. But those who believe in other religions along with their own religion, he says, they (Hindus) have the credit of demolishing mosques and building temples.[32] Destroyed Hindu Temples Babur and Humayun were against the policy of demolishing Hindu temples. According to Humayun's personal retainer named Bayazid Peyt, Akbar gave two villages for the mosque and madrasa. These are said to have demolished Hindu temples. These are said to have been made under Dodar Mall. Todar was a Hindu minister (vizier) in Akbar's court.[31] During Akbar's time Todar Mal was considered simple (sada-la). Because he wept bitterly over the loss of the idols he worshipped. He was blindly and narrowly following Hindu practices. Akbar's forces were responsible for the destruction of golden idols in Hindu temples in the Tobe region between the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.[31] According to historians Abd al-Qawadir Batoni, 200 cows were destroyed at Nagarkot near Kangra during Akbar's reign. And Hindus were killed. Temples were destroyed.[31] Temples were demolished during Chittur's third boundary marking. After the copper wax sticks were presented by Akbar at Ajmer in memory of Moi Nut's Christi, they were taken away by Akbar after the destruction of the Kalika temple. These took place during the third boundary code of Chitor.[34] The Jesuit fathers Monseret, Aquivaiva and Enrique came to Akbar's court in the early 1580s. According to their reference and religion, Muslims demolished many Hindu temples as per their wish. Muslim mausoleums and Muslim memorials were built on the demolished site. They were venerated as sages .[35] Monserrate tutored the king's son Murat. Anti-Jihad Hindu Kings Akbar's reign was considered a pious Islam by traditional Muslims. and was considered a deterrent to infiltration from it.[36] Rizqullah Mustaqi, a well-known Islamic scholar of Delhi, wrote in 1580 that Akbar was sent by God to protect Islam, especially from oppression by Hemu [37]. Akbar launched a holy war (Jihad) against the Hindu kings of Islam across India A third reference to Chittur in 1567-CE, 8000 Rajputs said that the Rajputs were inside the fort to protect Hindu temples. This is said to have happened when Akbar's cavalry attacked the plains. These 8000 men are said to have died to the last to resist Akbar's army and save the Hindu temples from attack. In addition, over 30,000 unarmed men are said to have been killed by Akbar's army [38].[38] It is said to have taken place on February 24, 1568 CE by his order. Cardanian measures the victory of the Battle of Cannae by the rings that Ecacustrine took from the Roman soldiers. Akbar measured this victory by the valuable ribbons of the Rajput soldiers and the ribbons received by the Chittoor soldiers as well. These are said to be 74.5 human beings. Humans (this unit is said to weigh 40 kg in India) are considered the number 74.5 in Rajasthan to commemorate this act. They consider it the ""sinful deed of Chittoor"". Akbar is said to have celebrated this victory by laying the foundations of a new city across Chittoor and Ranthambore. Agra was considered as a new city in 1569 as W.S.T.P.U. It was called Badepur Sikri (City of Victory) [40] Buoyed by his victory, Akbar invaded further and became a proud champion of Islam and actively propagated the Islamic doctrine, naming it Bade Nama-e-Chittur, after conquering Chittur in Ajmer. On his way to Agra, he stayed there for some time and issued the policy in Ramzan 10,975/March 9, 1568. Then Akbar destroyed those who had more than one religion (Hindus) who were hated and more talented than one religion (Hindus). It was brought about by the dutiful Mujahideen with their thunderous triumphant curved scythe. ""Fight and Allah will give them into your hand as good victories. He will humble them and make you victorious over them. [98] And the voice of leave was raised against the Hindu kings of India for jihad. Otherwise the demolition of Hindu temples was also called for. This happened by the mercy of my God. He I Let's try to be grateful. We are the people around us and our customs and cities who are victorious from the Hindus by the help of Allah who will reward our good efforts in war (Qisa) and religious work. Therefore, about Islam everywhere We must remove the darkness caused by various principles and the evil deeds caused by the sword. Of particular importance was the publication of the radical policy of jishya in 1575.[42] Abd al-Quwadir Badani was then the chief religious leader or head of religious education in the state in Akbar's court, a public interview with Akbar, that is, when Akbar's army rushed towards Rana Pratap in 1576, he said, ""I ask you to leave the blood of Hinduism with the noble Islam"" by Akbar Badani. Seeing the explanation and his duty towards Islam, he gave him a handful of gold coins as a token of his happiness and gave them to Patani.[43] Akbar stated in his letter that he was Islam's most successful warrior in 1579 to Abdullah Khan, a recruiter of Duran. Here their swords do not shine, but they have become the abode of Muslims and the home of their faith (Muslim). Churches and temples of those who believe in more than one religion (Hindus) and their avenues are mosques and sacred symbols, reflecting etiquette. Praise be to God (Allah).[44] The Jizya tax on Hindus was abolished in 1562. But they were brought back in 1575. Again it was taxed in 1580.[45] This tax was used by Muslim rulers as a weapon to convert Hindus to Islam. It is a tax imposed on Hindus. Muslims do not have this tax.[46] This tax was a burden on the Hindus. The lives of Hindus were sacrificed if their conversion to Islam would not spare their lives. Firoz Shah Tughlaq explains how jizya helped in religious conversion. He said, ""I cannot convert the unbelievers (those who believe in more than one religion) to the religion protected by God and they should be exempted from the Jizya tax if they continue to be Muslims."" A large number of Muslims converted themselves to Islam and became respected.[47] Akbar's Jizya tax on Hindus and temple taxes were temporary and never really benefited Hindus.[48] Hindu Views of Akbar Akbar converted many Hindus against their will [49] to Islam. and converted major Hindu holy places to Islamic ones. For example he changed Prayag to Allahabad [50] in 1583.[51] During Akbar's reign, his general Hussain Khan's ""dukriya"" made non-Muslims (Hindus) wear cloths of various colors on the shoulders or arms with indecent parts [52]. According to historian Dasaratha Sharma, we want to present Akbar's reign through the Akbar Nama etc., and we want to present Akbar's reign as the best, and show more than the respect due to Akbar.[54] Looking at the work ""Talbat Vilas"" composed during the same period, it seems that Akbar treats Hindus very badly.[55] When Akbar Kumar started hunting in the Pera-Rohdas Girjaga area (many Hindus) The Rajput chiefs were sequestered on the banks of the river Jhelum. When Akbar arrived there, the Rajput chiefs, the Hindus, went to meet him. Dunhaji was a little late among them. Akbar beat him himself with a whip. A young Rajput prince, Prithivitipa, was commissioned to play by his uncle. Akbar ordered Prithivitibha's uncle to be let go with a whip. Due to this heartbreaking incident, the Rajput stabbed himself three times with a sword. He did this to further confuse Akbar. But Akbar ordered his decision to be trampled to death by an elephant. When Dalpat Singh of Bikaner and his colleagues visited Akbar to bury the body of the Rajputs, they saw him shouting ""let the Hindus eat the cows"". After that Hindus were never about Akbar nor did Akbar put Hindus in high positions. This became clear when Akbar's general Man Singh refused to build the Vishwanath temple. This was done with Akbar's permission. Hindus ignored this temple. Because Man Singh's family was related to Akbar by marriage.[56] Akbar's Hindu generals never built temples without Akbar's orders. Man Singh started building a temple in Bengal in 1595. But Akbar ordered it to be changed. [57] Animosity towards Akbar came to light following the rebellion of the Hindu leader Raja Ram Akbar's burial site at Sikandra in Agra. But his attempt was thwarted by one Abulfasi, a Baujidar. Shortly thereafter Raja Ram reappeared in Sikandra in 1688 [58]. Shaista Khan attacked Akbar's mausoleum before his arrival as governor. And gold, silver, king's welcome favours, lamps and many other varieties were carried away as the main commodities. What he could not carry was destroyed. Rajaram and his men took Akbar's bones and cremated them. This is the trauma caused by the grave inflicted on Muslims.[59] They went about breaking open the great copper gates, and taking away the costly ornaments, and destroying what they could not carry away. And their anger against the Mughal kings became more shockingly angry. As those who took the bones of Akbar they put them in the fire and burned them.[60] Relations with Muslims. In 1567, the tomb of Akbar Mir Murtasha Shy Ri B Shirazi was excavated. It is thought to have been done so because its appearance was inappropriate for the tomb of Amir Kusaru. Because Mir is a Shia Muslim. This is because they cannot be buried near Sunni Muslims.[61] In 1572, Akbar sent a French envoy to Abdul Samad. Abdul Samad was the leader who guided the military and administration. This he sent to destroy the apostasy in the Pargana. This suggests Akbar's misconception of Shi'ism.[61] Akbar suppressed the Mahadavi movement in 1573. He did this strongly in his campaign in Gujarat. Mian Mustafa Bandaki of Mahatavi was arrested and subsequently brought to court and later executed.[61] Relations with the Ottoman Empire Akbar sent a Hajj delegation to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in October 1576. He sent it from the port city of Surat. A group of distinguished women also made this journey and reached the Holy City in time in 1577, and from 1577 to 1580 several groups of four were sent to the capitals of Islam, Mecca and Medina, loaded with gifts. Pilgrims belonging to these groups were poor. Their overstaying burdened the cities. [62] Ottoman officials asked the pilgrims to return home. A group of respectable women refused to return home after Hajj. But at the request of the Ottoman king they were forced to return home in 1580 by the governor of Aden, who persuaded Akbar's elite group of women. This program urged him not to send a group of women on the Haj pilgrimage. It also urged him to forbid the sending of Sadaquit to Mecca and Medina. Therefore, Akbar confusedly wanted to become the caliph or sole virtual head of the Sunni Muslim community. This was followed by a manuscript called ""Mahsar"" by ""Ulama"" Islamic scholars in September 1579 to confirm this. Affirmations of Mahasar Akbar was also the caliph of the time The value of the Caliph is greater than that of the Mujtahid Disagreements within the Muj Tahad required Akbar to decide on some point and Akbar [[Nas ( (Islam )|Nasir]] can give orders that are not against In 1579, Akbar started religious campaigns and religious activities. He delivered sermons as a formal preacher and as a platformer. These sayings were composed by Baisi and were composed by Sheikh Mubarak's eldest son. During that period he began to hint that he had lost faith in the sanctity of Mecca.[63] From 1584 Akbar seriously considered attacking the Ottoman port of Eman with the help of the Portuguese. In 1584 a Mughal envoy was permanently stationed in Goa to establish a liaison. In 1587 the port force of the Portuguese who went to attack Yemen and Habash was defeated. and the leader, Dokondo Brino, was captured. Thus ended the Mughal-Portuguese relationship.[64] Relations with Christians In 1603 a request made by Christian priests named Burman was accepted. According to this, anyone can convert according to their choice.[65] Priests struggled to carry out their work with Brahman and weapons. While the staunch Muslim officers were the respected leaders of Lahore, Qulichi Khan cunningly put many Christians to flight. Priest Pinhiro fled in fear of death.[66] Abandoning Islam After leaving Islam [67] he started a new religious movement. Deen Elahi combines all religious principles (mainly Hinduism, Muslim and Sikhism, Christian ideas, Jainism, Zoroastrianism) and separates them into different parts. Akbar was tolerant of religions other than Islam. In fact he not only tolerated but also debated religious and ideological concepts. This helped in the establishment of Ibadat Khana, a house of worship at Badepur Sikri. From 1575 onwards Akbar emphasized a point of view from the discussions he received and the things he conducted. This means that no religion can consider itself as a religion that reflects the truth. This led him to create Deen Elahi in 1581. Many Muslim scholars, including the Qadi of Bengal and Seminal Sabii, and Sayyaq Ahmad Sirhandi, called this absurd. Deen Ilahi is a righteous concept. It prevents desire, sensuality of feelings, aversion and pride. Doing good, being prudent, self-control, and being kind are the main principles to consider as traits. The soul is encouraged to purify itself by thinking of the Lord [68]. It has no sacred concepts or authority classes for teaching.[69] Deen Ilahi contains Akbar's religious ideas, philosophy, naturalistic method of worship. It has no god or reflecting principle. Media Comment In 2008 Ashutosh Gauriger released a film narrating the story of Akbar and his wife Hira Kunwari (known as Jodha Bhai) titled Jodha Akbar. Hrithik Roshan played the role of Akbar. Aishwarya Rai Jodha played the role. Prithivi Raj portrayed her in the award-winning film Mohal e Azam (The Glorious Mogul) released in 1960. Akbar and Birbal are in love with the Hindi serial Akbar-Birpal, which aired on Zee TV in 1990 and was filmed by Vikram Gokhale as Akbar. Akbar-Birpal si-Gujarat is now being broadcasted. But the language has been changed in Gujarati language. Television serial 'Akbar the Great' by Sanjay Khan was telecast on DD in 1990 on National Wave. In a somewhat fictionalized novel, Kim Stanley's 2002 novel ""The Years Aba Rice and Salt"", Akbar appears as a prominent supporting character. Akbar Salman Rushdie's 2008 novel ""The Enchantress in Florence"" Amartya Sen gives an example in his book ""The ""Argumentative Indian"" and ""Violence"" and ""Identity"" and more. Bertrand Small would feature prominent characters in his romances as important characters in his novels. Likewise Akbar did not fail to interrupt. He is considered as an important protagonist in two of his major novels. and mentions Akbar in his third novel. But in this novel Akbar is mentioned after his death. In the novel ""This Heart of Mine"" she is considered the fortieth spouse for some time. and is said to revolve around his English daughter in Wild Jasmine and Darling Jasmine. His decision was regarded as an unfortunate one for the people of India and Persia. Akbar is considered to be one of India's most respected men. In the popular game ""The Age of Empires 111: The Asian Dynasties"". A violin piece entitled ""II Grasso Mohel"" was published by Antonio Vivaldi in the 1720s and is coded RV 208 in his regular collections. He is implicitly supportive of Akbar's rule.

"Lake Baikal (Russian:о́зеро Байка́л, tr.Ozero Baykal,IPA:[ˈozʲɪrə bɐjˈkɑl]; Russian Buryat: Байгал нуур, Mongolian: Байгал нуур Baygal nuur, Mongolian: ""natural lake"" [3]) is a lake in Russia (Russia). ) is a freshwater baryeri (large lake) located between the northwest of Irkutsk Province and the southeast of the Republic of Buryatia in southern Siberia. It is the deepest lake in the world.[4] With a depth of 1,642m (5,387ft),[1] it is the largest fresh water lake at 23,615.39 km 3 (5,670 cu mi).[1] It is the clearest lake in the world, [5] and the oldest lake in the world.[6] It is believed to be - 25 million years old. [7] It is the seventh largest lake in the world by area. This single lake contains 20% of the world's fresh surface water in the form of water.[8] [9] 90% of Russia's fresh water is contained in this aquifer. It has been protected as a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in 1996. [10]. The volume of water in Lake Baikal is greater than the total water volume of the five canyons in the United States combined,[11] but because of the shallower depth of the American canyons, Lake Baikal's water surface is smaller than that of the American canyons. Lake Baikal is 636 kilometers long and 80 kilometers wide at its maximum. The total area is 31,494 square kilometers. More or less, about 300 rivers bring water to this river. Among these six major rivers are notable. They are: Chikoy, Khiloh, Uda, Barguzin and Upper Angara. There are about 22 small islands in this river. The largest of these islands is the island of Olkhon. The island is 72 km long. The Baikal volcano is believed to have originated around 25-30 million years ago. Like Lake Tanganyika, Lake Baikal's 31,722 (12,248 sq mi) area was formed by a long, crescent-shaped, ancient rift. In Baikal, the species living in this river are unique. More than two-thirds of the species here are found nowhere else. 1085 species of aquatic plants and 1550 species of aquatic fauna are known to exist in the lake. The eastern part of the lake is home to the Baryat tribe,[12][13] who also raise goats, camels, cattle and sheep.[13] Because of its ancient history, it is maintained that it is a great contribution to the history of living organisms. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The region has an average minimum temperature of -19 °C (-2 °F) in winter and a maximum of 14 °C (57 °F) in summer.[14] Lake Baikal is also known as the ""Elder Sister of Lakes"". History The Baikal region, sometimes called Baikal, has a long history of human habitation. The Khuriscans, an ancient people known in the region, are known to be the forerunners of two ethnic groups, the Buryats and the Yakuts. Lake Baikal was called the ""North Sea"" (北海 Běihǎi) in Chinese historical texts.[15] It is found in the Han-Han war record as extending from the northern Siberian taiga of the Han Dynasty to the Xiangnu region in the south. Europeans became aware of the lake after Russia's European expansion in the 17th century. The first Russian expedition to reach Lake Baikal was Kurbat Ivanov in 1643. [16]: Trans-Siberian Railway between 1896 and 1902. 200 bridges and 33 tunnels were built around the southwestern end of Lake Baikal. For several years until its completion, a train ran across the lake from Port Baikal to Mysovaya. Many died in the cold during the Great Siberian Snow March of 1920, a military history. In 1956, the breach of the Irkutsk Dam on the Angara River raised the lake level by 1.4 m (4.6 ft). The first detailed demarcation map was created by a geological survey of a large lake basin led by Drizhenko (f.k.Drizhenko) when the railway was built. Research Several organizations associated with the government or government agencies are conducting natural research projects on Lake Baikal. An independent research organization, the Baikal Research Center, conducts Lake Baikal environmental education and research programs.[17] In July 2008, Russia sent two small submersibles, the Mir-1 and Mir-2, to a depth of 1,592 m (5,223 ft) in Lake Baikal to conduct geological and biological tests on its private environment. A truly successful report, however, they reached a depth of 1,580 m (5,180 ft),[18] but were unable to achieve the world record for maximum water depth. That record is now 1,637 m (5,371 ft) by Russian scientist Anatoly Sakhalevich. economy It is nicknamed the ""Pearl of Siberia"" and attracts the attention of tourism and industrial investors. Victor Grigrov in Irkutsk plans to build three hotels here. In 2007, the Russian government created a special economic zone in the Baikal region. Rashtam, an international uranium plant, has decided to build a laboratory in the Baikal region with an investment of $2.5 billion, which will create 2,000 jobs in Angrushk. Environmental issues Bagalshk Paper and Pulp Factory Built in 1966, the Bagalshk Paper and Pulp Factory closed in November 2008 due to business losses following strong protests over the dumping of chlorine-bleaching waste directly into Baikal. Resumed production on On 13 January 2010, President Vladimir Putin visited the lake from a small submarine and announced that the bike was in good condition. East Siberian Pacific Ocean Oil Pipeline Russian state-run oil pipeline company Transneft plans to build an oil pipeline 800 meters (2,600 feet) along the shore of Lake Baikal in an area of ​​high seismic risk. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Transneft project to be moved 40 kilometers north to an alternative route to avoid such environmental hazards. Construction of the pipeline from Lake Baikal's alternate route began two days after the work received President Putin's approval. Proposed nuclear plant In 2006, the Russian government extended 95 km from the shores of the lake. (59 miles) away has announced plans to build the world's first international uranium enrichment facility at an existing nuclear research center in the city of Angrusk. After enrichment, only 10 percent of the resulting radioactive material will be exported to international customers, and the remaining 90 percent will be kept in the storage area of ​​Lake Baikal.

"Australia, Australia or Australasia (Australia) is a country that includes the world's smallest continent and the world's largest island, the mainland, the island of Tasmania, and some small islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia. It has no land border with any country. Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea are its neighbors to the north, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia to the north-east and New Zealand to the south-east. History tells us that Aboriginal Australians have lived on the Australian mainland for nearly 42,000 years[1]. After occasional fishermen from the north, and later Dutch explorers from Europe in 1606[2], the British landed in the eastern part of Australia in 1770 and claimed it for the United Kingdom. The colony of New South Wales was created on January 26, 1788, initially as a settlement scheme for English and Scottish convicts. Later, as the population grew, more new areas of Australia were discovered and five more autonomous British colonies were established during the 19th century. On 1 January 1901 the six separate colonies united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, a federal government with an open democratic constitution. Its capital is Canberra. Despite being the sixth largest country by area, it has a population of just 23.2 million (2.32 crore, 2013 estimate[3]). 60 percent of them live in mainland areas around state capitals. Australia follows Western economic systems. Per capita income is on par with strong economies. Only 5% of the workforce is engaged in agriculture. A country rich in oil and minerals. Origin of Name The name Australia is derived from the Latin word Australis. The concept is south. In 1521 the Spaniard became the first European to sail across the Pacific Ocean. The word Australia was first used in the English language in 1625.[4] In 1638 the Dutch East India Company, based in Jakarta, named their new discovery further south Australische. The name ""Australia"" came into widespread use in 1814 when Matthew Flinders, the first British sailor to circumnavigate Australia, used the name ""Australia"" in his book A Voyage to Terra Australis. New South Wales Governor Lachlan Macquarie recommended the name to the colonial government on 12 December 1817[5]. The name was adopted in 1824. In Australian English ""Australia"" is pronounced as əˈstɹæɪljə, -liːə, -jə[6]. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Australia has been referred to locally and internationally as Oz and Australians as Aussie. History Australian Aborigines Studies date the first human settlement of Australia between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago [7]. They are now known as the ancestors of the tribes in Australia. Evidence has been confirmed that they were at Laje Mungo in New South Wales. Although inhabited by humans since before the Stone Age, they are believed to have separated from the present-day Southeast Asian islands very early. Genetically and linguistically, the relationship and relationship of these tribes (with other nationalities) is not confirmed. Majority of these tribes are hunter-gatherers. Melanesians are a tribe living in far-north Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands. Their culture and lifestyle are different from other tribes. Arrival of the European The first European to reach the Australian mainland was the Dutch sailor Willem Jansoon. He sighted the shores of Cape York Peninsula in 1606. During the 17th century the Dutch settled on the western and northern shores and named the area Nova Hollandia. But they did not try to settle there. In 1770, English Captain James Cook during his Pacific voyage landed on the east coast of Australia and claimed it for Great Britain, naming it New South Wales. His discoveries later led to British convict settlement there. The monarchical colony of New South Wales was founded on January 26, 1788 in Jackson's Department by Arthur Phillip. This day was later named Australia Day as Australia's national day. Settlement in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania) began in 1803 and became a separate colony in 1825.[8] The western part of Australia (the Swan River Settlement) was officially claimed by the United Kingdom in 1829. In 1832 the region became known as Western Australia. The separate colonies of South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859 were separated from New South Wales. In 1911, the Northern Territory separated from South Australia and became a separate state. South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia did not begin as British convict settlements. However, Victoria and Western Australia later began accepting convicts[9] and sent convicts to New South Wales was stopped in 1848 after opposition from settlers.[10] When Europeans first settled here in 1788, approximately 350,000 tribes lived on the continent[11]. At that time 500 types of tribes were living in this continent with their own language. Their numbers began to decline drastically over the next 150 years. Infectious disease, forced resettlement, cultural adjustment etc. are considered to be the main reasons for this [12]. Researchers believe that forced eviction of tribal children from their families is also the reason for this decline [13]. Following a referendum in 1967, the central government was empowered to make policy changes and enact new laws regarding tribals. Native title was not recognized in Australia until 1992. Following the famous Mabo v Queensland case heard in the High Court of Australia, lands under European occupation were previously considered terra nullius (""empty land"") and land titles were given to those who had held the land for generations. Federation During the period 1855 - 1890, the six colonies formed their own governments and began to look after their own local affairs as if they were within the British Empire. The colonial administration based in London was particularly concerned with foreign affairs, defense and international shipping. On 1 January 1901, the Australian Confederation was established. A ""Commonwealth of Australia"" was born within the British Empire. In 1911, part of the state of New South Wales was separated into a separate territory called the Australian Capital Territory, and the capital of the federation, Canberra, was established here in 1927. Until then Melbourne was the temporary capital of the Confederation. The Northern Territory, which was part of South Australia, was separated in 1911 and brought under Central Government. Australia entered the war voluntarily in World War I[14]. Australian participation in the Battle of Gallipoli was the country's first major military engagement. Despite their defeat, the move is seen by most Australians as a national uprising. In the United Kingdom, the Act of Westminster 1931, enacted in 1931, maintained the constitutional relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom, but a 1942 bye-law ended the 1931 Act. The United Kingdom's shocking defeats in Asia during World War II in 1942 and the collapse of the Japanese Empire provided Australia with an opportunity to align with the United States. Since 1951, Australia has had a defense treaty with the United States called Ansus. After the Second World War, people from Europe were allowed to settle in Australia. People from Asia and non-European countries were encouraged to immigrate here from the 1970s after the end of the White Australia policy. After this there was a great change in the heritage, culture, and self-determination of the people of Australia. The constitutional link between Australia and the United Kingdom was further split in 1986 following the passage of the Australia Act 1986. After this act was passed, Britain's role in the Australian states came to an end. An appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom was barred[15]. In a 1999 referendum on Australia becoming a republic, 54 percent voted against. Political Commonwealth Australia is a parliamentary democracy with a middle-class government. Elizabeth II is Queen of Australia. In the interim rule, the Queen has appointed a Governor-General and separate Governors for the respective states on her behalf. Although the Governor-General has many executive powers under the Constitution, he usually exercises his powers on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia. Only once, in 1975, did the Governor-General arbitrarily remove the then Whitlam government[16]. A total of three governmental bodies operate in Australia: Legislature: Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Governor, Senate and People's Representatives are part of it. The Governor-General participates on behalf of the Governor. Executive Council: The Central Executive Council consists of the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet. Law: High Court and Arbitral Tribunals of Australia. Appeals to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom ceased in 1986. The bicameral Parliament of Australia consists of 76 members in the Senate (upper) and 150 members in the House of Representatives (lower). Below Members One member is elected from each constituency. The Upper House has 12 members from each state, two from each of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Elections to both houses are held once in three years. The party with the lowest number of members forms the government. Its leader is elected as the Prime Minister. States and Territories Western Australia Northern Territory South Australia Queensland New South Wales Australian Capital Territory Victoria Tasmania Indian Ocean Timor Sea Gulf of Carpentry Arafura Seea Great Australian Bight Tasman Sea Bass Strait Coral Sea ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● South Pacific Ocean Southern Ocean Great Barrier Reef Australia is a self-governing country consisting of six states, two territories and a few other small territories. The states are: New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania. The two main regions are the Northern Region and the Australian Capital Territory. Although the functions of the territories are generally similar to those of the states, the constitution of the territories can be changed by the central government (Australian Government). Whereas the Central Government can only change the provisions of Article 51 (Special) Acts of the State Governments. Hospitals, education, police, law, roads, public transport, local government etc. are under the control of state governments. Each state and territory has its own separate assemblies (parliaments). Among these, the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Queensland have one assembly, while other states have two lower and upper assemblies. The head of government of the states is called the Prime Minister and the head of the regions is called the Chief Minister. The Queen appoints a Governor in each state and an Administrator in the Northern Zone as her representative. There are also some smaller territories in Australia. Jervis Island is a naval base located in the state of New South Wales and is administered by the Commonwealth of Nations. In addition to these, the following territories are controlled by Australia: Norfolk Island Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands Ashmore Cartier Islands Coral Sea Islands Hart Island and Macdonald Islands Australian Antarctic Territory Geography Australia is located on the Indo-Australian Plateau surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans and separated from the Asian continent by the Arabian and Timor seas. Covering an area of ​​7,617,930 square kilometers[17], most of the country is desert. Australia's land mass consists of 34,218 km of coastline (excluding islands)[18]. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest barrier reef[19], is found off the northeast coast of Australia. Its length is more than 2000 km. Mount Augustus in Western Australia is considered the world's largest monolith[20]. At 2,228m, Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain in mainland Australia. Mount Mosan is 2,745 m high in the territory of Hart Island and Macdonald Islands off the Peruvian mainland. Australia is the flattest continent. It is the driest of the human-inhabited continents, with old and poor soils. Most Australians live along the southeast coast of the country. The northern part of the country is a tropical region. There are rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, deciduous forests, and deserts. Climate change has become a major issue in Australia in recent times[21]. Although rainfall has increased over the past century[22], much of Australia remains water-scarce. Due to population growth in cities, and local droughts, water restrictions are in effect in many cities[23]. The majority of the population's current (2008) estimated 21.3 million Australians are descendants of people who came from Europe during the colonial and pre-federal period. Most of them are immigrants from the British Isles. Even today, the majority of Australians are of British and Irish descent. Australia's population has quadrupled since the First World War[25]. This strengthened the support for the immigration plan. After World War II, and from then until 2000, nearly 5.9 million people immigrated. That means almost two in seven Australians are foreign-born[26]. Most of the immigrants were skilled in some field[27], although family members and refugees were allowed to immigrate.[27] According to a 2001 estimate, the majority of foreign-born were born in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Vietnam, and China[28]. After the abandonment of the White Australia policy in 1973, several programs were introduced at the government level to promote inter-racial unity based on multiculturalism[29]. In 2005–06, more than 131,000 people immigrated to Australia. The majority of these are from Asia and the changing Oceania regions[30]. In 2006–07 the number of immigrants was estimated at 144,000[31]. 300,000 people are planned to be accommodated during 2008-9. This is the largest number of immigrants since World War II[32]. In 2001 the number of Aboriginal people in mainland Australia (Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) was 410,003. This is 2.2% of the country's total. This is 115,953 more than in 1976. Arrests, unemployment, illiteracy, etc. are the problems faced by the Australian aborigines. Their average life expectancy is up to 17 years shorter than other non-Indigenous Australians[33]. As in other developed countries, Australia's population appears to be aging. More are seen as retirees and a smaller proportion as professionals. The median age of the population in 2004 was 38.8 years[34]. A large number of Australians (759,849 in 2002–03)[35] lived outside their country of birth. vt Largest populated areas in Australia 2019 data from Australian Bureau of Statistics[36] Rank Name State Pop.

The majority speak Australian English. It resembles British English but has some pronunciation and vocabulary unique to Australians. Grammar and spelling are similar to British English. According to a 2001 survey, English was the language spoken at home by 80 percent. followed by Chinese (2.1%), Italian (1.9%), and Greek (1.4%). The majority of immigrants here are bilingual. Around 200 or 300 language-speaking tribes are believed to have lived here at the time of European settlement. Only 70 of these are in the case today. Almost 50,000 (0.25%) people have an indigenous language as their first language. Religion There is no official religion in Australia. According to a 2006 survey, 64% of Australians identified themselves as Christian. Of these, 26% follow Roman Catholicism and 19% follow Anglicanism. 19% identified as not belonging to our religion. 12% did not identify themselves religiously. Christians are followed by 2.1% Buddhists, 1.7% Muslims, 0.8% Hindus and 0.5% Jews. Less than 6% of the total are non-Christian[38]. As in other Western countries, there are few people who go to Christian churches. 1.5 million people attend churches weekly. This is 7.5% of the total population[39]. Education In Australia, schooling is compulsory from age 6 to age 15 (age 16 in South Australia, age 17 in Western Australia, and age 17 in Queensland). This puts the adult literacy rate at 99%. Australia's education system currently ranks eighth in the world[40]. There are a total of 38 state universities here. Besides, there are many private universities which are running on government subsidy. More than these, government technical colleges are running in these states. Education for various industries and professionals is provided here. 58% of Australians aged 25 to 65 have industrial or tertiary qualifications[33]. According to Health 2006 data, the average life expectancy of Australians is 78.7 years for men and 83.5 years for women[41]. Australia has the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world,[42] while tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of death and disease[43]. Australia has the highest prevalence of obesity among developed countries[44]; Meanwhile, Australia is one of the countries that has successfully prevented the spread of AIDS[45][46]. Australian Tamils ​​Tamils ​​began to migrate to Australia from the 1970s. Before that some people have come with work permit. Government estimates indicate that a total of 162 Tamils ​​immigrated to Australia before 1971[47]. The first Tamil to migrate to Australia was Kamal K. Kamaleswaran. The number of Tamil Australians increased from 202 in 1971 to 11,376 in 1991. 60 percent of them are Eelam Tamils. According to government census, the number of Tamils ​​increased to 18,690 in 1996 and 24,067 in 2001[48]. More than 50 percent of them live in the state of New South Wales. Rather than Sri Lanka, they migrated to Australia from countries like India, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, and Fiji in anticipation of opportunities. Culture From 1788, Australia's culture was essentially Anglo-Celtic. However, the natural environment, and the culture of the tribes defined some of Australia's unique cultures. Since the mid-20th century, Australian culture has been heavily influenced by American popular culture (especially television and film), Australia's neighboring Asian countries, and immigration from non-English-speaking countries. The history of Australian painting begins with Aboriginal cave paintings [49]. Australian Aboriginal heritage has been passed down mostly through oral tradition and rituals. Aboriginal music, dance and painting have greatly influenced contemporary Australian culture. Famous painters like Emily Kingwarei and Gordon Bennett belong to the tribe. The National Gallery of Australia and art galleries in many states have collections of local and foreign paintings. Media Australia operates two public television services (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Multicultural Special Broadcasting Service) and three private television services. There are also many private cable, and many non-profit television services. Each of the state capitals publishes separate newspapers. Two newspapers are published nationally. According to Reporters Without Borders' 2008 report, Australia's media freedom is ranked 25th. New Zealand is ranked 7th and the United States is ranked 48th. Such a low rating for Australia is thought to be due to the fact that most of the press in the country is dependent on two large commercial companies, News Corporation and Joan Fairbox[50]. Sport In Australia 23.5 per cent of over 15s engage in some form of team sport [33]. Australia is internationally renowned for sports such as rowing, hockey, netball, rugby league, and rowing and swimming. The 1956 and 2000 Olympic Games were held in Australia. Australia has been among the top six medal winners since 2000[51]. [52] The Australian Open Grand Slam tournaments are world famous in tennis. Biodiversity Although much of Australia is semi-arid or desert, its habitats range from montane to tropical rainforest. Due to factors such as extreme climatic changes and long periods of geographical isolation, Australia's biota is unique and diverse. 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, 45% of birds and 89% of aquatic species such as fish are unique to Australia[53]. Kangaroo, koala, wallaroo are some of the Australian animals. Australia has the largest number of land animals in the world. There are about 755 species of reptiles[54]. Economy thumbnail|right|Australia's largest gold mine is located in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia The Australian dollar is the currency of Australia. In addition to Australia, it is also the official currency of Christmas Islands, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island, and the Pacific islands of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. Australia has a mixed economic system with Western countries. It was ranked third in the United Nations' 2007 Human Development Index and sixth in The Economist's 2005 World Standard of Living Index. The unemployment rate in Australia in 2007 was 4.6%. GDP is slightly higher than that of the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Also, in The Economist magazine's list of the world's most livable cities (2008), Melbourne was ranked 2nd, Perth 4th, Adelaide 7th, and Sydney 9th [55].

"Mars is a planet in the solar system. It is the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is the second smallest planet in this family after Mercury, the smallest planet. The Manatees named this planet after the god of war. Iron oxide on its surface gives the planet its red color.[13] Hence the name Mars. A terrestrial planet whose surface has craters like the Moon and volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and ice-covered polar regions like the Earth. Mars has cycles and seasons similar to Earth's. Mount Olympus, the tallest mountain in the Solar System, and Mariner Valley, one of the largest vertical canyons, are on Mars. Until the successful flyby of Mariner 4 in 1965, Mars was believed to have liquid water on its surface. This belief was attributed to the periodic black and white markings near the polar regions of the planet. They thought that these could be oceans and continents. It was also thought that the long dark scratches seen on the surface could be irrigation canals. This was later interpreted as an optical illusion. However, geological evidence collected by manned missions indicates that Mars once had large amounts of water.[14] It has two moons, Phobosu and Teimosu. They are small and irregular in shape. Like 5261 Eureka, the Martian droid asteroid, these could be asteroids captured by Mars' gravity. Physical Properties The diameter of Mars is half the diameter of Earth. Its density is less than that of Earth. Mars has a mass equal to 15% that of Earth and a mass equal to 11% that of Earth. Its surface area is slightly less than that of Earth's dry land.[7] Mars is also large and imposing on Mercury. But Mercury is denser than Mars. Geology Mars is a terrestrial planet composed of minerals containing silicon, oxygen, metals, and other rock-forming elements. The surface of Mars is composed mostly of tholeiitic limestones.[15] However, some areas have a silica concentration similar to that of common limestones. It can look like the Earth's igneous crystalline rock or silica glass. Areas of low translucency have steeper quartz concentrations, and in the northern region of particular translucency, plate silicas and high-silicon glasses are present in normal concentration. High-silicon pyrocenes occur in detectable quantities in some parts of the southern highlands. Amethyst and olivines are also present here and there.[16] Soil Data from the Phoenix lander show that Martian soil is alkaline and contains elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Found in Earth's gardens, these are essential for plant growth. Soil tests show that the soil has a pH of 8.3 and contains perchlorate salts. Incisors are common on Mars, and new incisors appear on the slopes of craters and valleys. These scratches are initially dark in color and fade in color over time. Sometimes these cracks, which appear to be small, then extend for hundreds of meters. These scratches can also be seen running along the edge of rocks and other obstacles in their path. Liquid water is unlikely to exist on the surface of Mars due to low buoyancy, although water may remain liquid for short periods of time in hydrological lows. The ice caps found at both poles are thought to be composed mostly of water. The water produced by the melting of the ice in the south polar ice cap would be enough to cover the entire surface of Mars by 11 meters. Visible craters on Mars indicate that liquid water may have once existed on its surface. Massive oblong drainage ditches, known as outflow canals, cut across the Martian surface at about 25 locations. These are believed to be traces of landslides caused by the release of water from underground reservoirs that caused the disaster. However, some believe that these may have been caused by glaciers or lava flows. The most recent of these canals appeared only a few million years ago. From the shape of such channel networks found elsewhere, they suggest that these may be runoff marks from early Martian rain or ice. Climate of Mars The surface temperature of Mars ranges from +27 to -126 degrees. (from +58 to -88.3 on Earth). But the average temperature is -48 degrees Celsius because it is farther from the Sun than Earth. Its atmosphere is very thin and contains mostly carbon-dioxide. It looks very red in a telescope. That is why Mars is called the red planet in English. Like Earth, the poles are ice regions. Ice here is mostly carbon-dioxide called 'dry ice'. A large ice crater has also been discovered at the north pole of Mars. As of now (Dec-2018) this ice crater has water surrounding giant icebergs 5,905 feet thick[]. Glacier This glacier was discovered during the European Space Agency's Mars probe. This glacier was caught in its camera when the spacecraft sent to Mars in 2003 was carrying out its research in the north pole of Mars. At the North Pole lies a great canyon, about 50.1 miles long and 1.2 miles wide. It is named as Korolev crater. It is named after the famous aerospace engineer Sergei Korolev. Korolov served as the chief rocket launch engineer on such landmark space exploration projects as Sputnik and Vostok. Beagle2 - Britain's mission to Mars Already in 1997, America's Pathfinder rover landed on Mars. It was decided at a meeting of the European Space Agency (ESA) in December 2000 that Britain's Beagle 2 rover would land on Mars in the Isitis Planitia plain between the ancient hills and the northern plains. Beagle 2 will be launched by ESA's 'Mars Express' rocket in June 2003 from the Baikanur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan (Russia). Beagle2's goal is life on Mars, or has it ever been? To find the final answer to the question. Isitis Plantia is the best place for that, and scientists think there's a good chance Mars might have found its fossils if there was ever life on Mars. Beagle 2 will use 'air bags' to land safely on Mars. When it hits the ground on Mars, these air bags are like a ball and after the MP falls to a stop, the gas inside is released and the vehicle comes out undamaged. Rover - America's other Mars exploration project Aside from the Beagle2 project, the US plans to land two robots on Mars in 2004. Both of these rovers will have equipment to search for water, i.e. water in liquid form, during the Tricycle. If water is in liquid form it can only be between 0 – 100 degrees. Also, since there is oxygen in the water, there are more possibilities for life (from single-celled organisms, bacteria to many types of organisms) to live in it. It is believed that life on earth first appeared in water. Starting with a list of 185 potential landing sites on Mars, the list has now been narrowed down to 30 most important sites. Experts have said that the importance is given to the place where scientific evidence is available rather than the place where it is possible to land without damage. A final decision on the landing site will be made one year prior to launch. American scientists say that the information sent by the spacecraft 'Mars Global Surveyor' currently orbiting Mars is very helpful. Rover mission plans The first rover robot will be launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on May 30, 2003, and the second on June 27 of the same year. It is expected to land on Mars on January 4 and February 8, 2004 respectively. These rovers are currently known as MER-A and MER-B. (MER – Mars Exploration Rover). Both rovers will cover a distance of 100 meters per Tuesday (24.62 hours). These are expected to work even beyond April 2004 if health is good.

"The Kingdom of Spain (Spain, /ˈspeɪn/(listen) España; Spanish: España, pronounced [esˈpaɲa](listen)) is a sovereign state located on the Iberian Peninsula (Peninsula) in southwestern Europe. Country. It is also a member state of the European Union. Its capital is Madrid. The language of this country is Spanish. It is the second most spoken language in the world. The European Euro currency is in common use in this country. Barcelona is another major city here. Due to its location, the region has been subject to many external influences since prehistoric times. Spain became a unified state in the 15th century following the marriage between Ferdinand II, King of Aragon, and Isabella I, Queen of Castile, and the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 1492. In modern times it developed into a world empire and established its spheres of influence in many parts of the world. Thus, the number of Spanish speakers in the world today is approximately 500 million. Spain is a republic under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. One of the developed countries, Spain is the 12th largest country in the world in terms of GDP. According to the 2005 census, it is a country with a high standard of living, having the 10th highest quality of life index in the world. It is also a member country of United Nations, NATO, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and World Trade Organization. Name The Spanish call their country España. In English it is called Spain. There are different opinions about the origin of these names. Hispania was the name given by the ancient Romans to Iberia, which refers to its territory. It is said to be a poetic case of Hesperia, given to refer to Esupania. The Greeks called Italy Hesperia, meaning ""land of the west"" or ""land of the setting sun,"" and Esuppania, further west, Hesperia ultima. In Punic the word Ispanihat means ""Land of Rabbits"" or ""Edge"". Coins issued in the region during Hadrian's reign bear the image of a hare at the feet of a female figure. Thus, some suggest that the word España may have been derived from Ispanihate, which associated the region with the rabbit, meaning ""Land of Rabbits"" or ""margin"" because of its location on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. They are also named after España, a Basque word for ""edge"" or ""border"". Antonio de Nebriza has proposed that Hispania may be derived from the Iberian word Hispalis, meaning ""city of the west"". History The various tribes of the peninsula (peninsula) known as Iberia or Iberia were also called Iberians or Iberians. After the 8th century BC, the Celtic tribes, followed by the Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians, successfully settled in the Mediterranean and established trading centers for several centuries. The Romans arrived in the Iberian Peninsula in the 2nd century BC. For two centuries warring Celtic and Iberian tribes combined coastal trading centers to form ""Ispania"". Spain supplied food, olive oil, wine and ores (metals) to the Roman Empire. In the early medieval period it came under the rule of the Cherumani, but later the Muslims from North Africa conquered the region. Over time, many small Christian kingdoms emerged in its northern part and gradually brought Spain under their control. It took centuries. In the same year that Columbus reached the Americas, the last Islamic state in the Iberian Peninsula fell. Subsequently, a world-wide empire was formed centered on Spain. This made Spain the most powerful country in Europe, one of the world's leading powers for a century and a half, and the world's largest overseas empire for three centuries. A series of wars and other problems brought Spain to a low ebb. Napoleon's conquest of Spain caused great confusion. This split the empire into many pieces, giving rise to liberation movements and creating political instability in the country as well. Before World War II, a civil war broke out and led to a dictatorial regime in Spain. Spain saw economic growth during this period, although it eventually experienced a period of vigorous economic growth. Over time, a parliamentary system under constitutional monarchy emerged and democracy was restored. Spain joined the European Union in 1986. Prehistory and pre-Roman people Archeology at Atapuerca shows that hominids lived on the Iberian Peninsula 1.2 million years ago. Modern humans reached the Iberian Peninsula from the north approximately 32,000 years ago. Famous among such human habitation artifacts are the prehistoric paintings found in the Altamira cave in Cantabria, northern Iberia. These paintings were painted by the Cro-Magnons around 15,000 BC. The current languages, religion, and legal system of Euspania are derived from Roman rule. The centuries-long uninterrupted reign of the Romans still has a profound influence on the culture of Spain. Geography With an area of ​​504,782 km² (194,897 sq mi), Spain is the 51st largest country in the world. It is the smallest in France at approximately 47,000 km² (18,000 sq mi) and the largest in the US state of California at 81,000 km² (31,000 sq mi). España lies between latitudes 26° - 44° N and longitudes 19° E - 5° N. Portugal on the western border of Spain; On the southern border are the British overseas territories of Cyprus and Morocco. It borders France and the small country of Andorra through the Pyrenees mountain range to the northeast. At Gerona is a small town called Livia, belonging to the Pyrenees and Spain, surrounded by France. Islands The Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, and several uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the Strait of Gibraltar known as Plaças de Soperania (Places of Glory) also fall within Spain's jurisdiction. Mountains and Rivers The headland of Esupania is a mountainous region with high plains and mountain ranges. Next to the Pyrenees, the most important mountain ranges are Cordillera Cantabrica, Chisutema Ibérico, Chisutema Central, Montesu de Toledo, Sierra Morena, Chisutema Benibetico. The highest peak in the Iberian Peninsula is Mulcassen at 3,478 meters in the Sierra Nevada. However, the highest point in Spain is Theide, an active volcano in the Canary Islands. It is 3,718 meters high. The Meseta Central is a vast plain located in the middle of the peninsula of Spain. Several important rivers flow through Ethiopia. These include Tagus, Ebro, Duero, Guadiana, and Guadalquivir. Alluvial plains are found along the coastal areas. The largest of these is the alluvial plain of the Guadalquivir River in Andalusia. Government The Spanish Constitution of 1978 was the result of Spain's transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. Spain's constitutional history begins in 1812. Spain's then King Van Carlos I, impatient with the slow pace of political reforms leading to the transition to a republic, removed the then prime minister, Carlos Arias Navarro, and replaced him with Adolfo Suarez. Following the elections held in 1977, the elected Parliament became the Constituent Assembly and drafted a new constitution. In a national referendum held on 6 December 1978, the new law received 88% of the vote. According to this constitution, Spain includes 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities. There is no such thing as a state religion in Spain. Everyone has the right to practice the religion of their choice.

"Nuclear reactor A nuclear reactor is a system that initiates nuclear reactions with complete control. In contrast, a detonation occurs when nuclear fusion occurs in an uncontrolled manner in a very short time. Nuclear reactors are widely used to generate electricity. The energy released from a nuclear reactor is released in the form of heat. The thermal energy released in the nuclear reactor drives the steam turbines. They help power ships and power generators in power stations, and steam is used to heat industrial processes and heat rooms. Nuclear reactors are used to produce radioactive elements and create nuclear weapons for nuclear medicine. Some are used for research and to produce high-energy plutonium. There are currently more than 450 nuclear power plants operating in many countries around the world to generate electricity.[1] The first nuclear reactor was built at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago in the United States under the name Chicago Pile-1 (CP1) in 1942 under the leadership of Enrico Permi. operating system Electrification usually takes place in thermal power plants using thermal energy from burning fossil fuels such as coal; In nuclear power plants, electricity is generated using the thermal energy of nuclear reactors. Fission reaction They undergo fission if they absorb large fissionable nuclei such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239. In that reaction it splits into two or more lighter nuclei. Then fissionable matter and energy, gamma rays and free radicals were released. A portion of these enzymes. It is then absorbed by other atoms and triggers further fission events. This continuous reaction is called nuclear reaction. To control this nucleation reaction, [[antitoxins and antioxidatives are used. These slow down the reaction by displacing enzymes that cannot participate in the cleavage reaction.[2] The fission reaction can be controlled or stopped automatically and manually when unsafe conditions are detected by monitoring.[3] Commonly used coolants are lean water (74.8% of the world's nuclear reactors), graphite (20% of reactors) and condensed water (5% of reactors). Beryllium and hydrogen atoms have been used as alternative quenchants in some process reactors.[2] Heat generation A nuclear reactor generates heat in several ways: The kinetic energy of the fissile material is converted into thermal energy when it combines with nearby atoms. The reactor absorbs the gamma rays produced in the nucleus and converts them into heat energy. Radioactive decay of fissile material stimulated by nitrogen absorption also produces heat. This heat gate continues for some time after the furnace is shut down from operation. One kilogram of uranium-235 (U-235) transformed by nuclear reactions produces approximately three million times as much energy as burning one kilogram of coal. (7.2×1013 joules per kilogram of uranium-235 saturation: 2.4×107 joules per kilogram of coal saturation).[4][5] Cooling Normally, water is used as a coolant in a nuclear reactor. Alternatively, sometimes aluminum or a liquid gold (liquid metal) such as liquid sodium is used as a molten salt. As this coolant is injected into the reactor, it absorbs the heat released by the nuclear fissure. This absorbed heat is then used to generate steam. Like pressurized water reactors, the cooling system in most reactors is objectively separated from the reactor itself. Furnace heat converts the water in the system into pressurized steam. This pressurized steam drives the steam turbine. However, some furnaces boil water directly to produce steam for the steam turbine; This method is used in boiling water furnaces.[6] reactive control The capacity output of the reactor is controlled and regulated by the addition of enzymes and the number of reactors produced. Control rods are made of acid-absorbing acid. If additional enzymes are absorbed by the control rod, less enzymes are left to perform the fission reaction. Inserting the control rod deeper into the reactor will decrease the capacity output, and pulling it out will increase the capacity output. Electrification The energy released by nuclear fission creates heat. A portion of this can be converted into useful energy. A common method of harnessing this heat energy is to use this heat to boil water to produce pressurized steam. This pressurized steam drives a vacuum rotor and an associated alternator generates electricity.[7] Elementary nuclear reactors Notumi was discovered in 1932. Nuclear fission, produced by nuclear reactions quenched by nitrogen, was then made practical in 1993 by Hungarian scientist Ilio Suzilard, who applied for a nuclear reactor license the following year while working at the Admiralty Office in London.[8] station elements Common elements of nuclear power plants are: Nuclear fuel A nuclear reactor Antioxidant Enzyme toxin Notumi mouth cooling control rods Furnace Boiler feed water pump Boiler (this is not required in boilers) Steam turbine Electron Consummation Cooling tower/refrigeration system (radioactive waste handling system) Fuel recovery site Used fuel tank Nuclear backup systems Reactor Protection System (RPS) Emergency diesel generators Emergency Reactor Cooling Systems (ECCS) Stagnant Water Control System (Critical Boron Filter, Boiler Boilers Only) Primary Service Water System (ESWS) Prison building Control room Emergency Operation Room/Reservoir Nuclear Training Center (usually contains a Control Room simulator) Quotations External links - Article by Jayaparathan Category:Nuclear Reactors Category:Nuclear power in India ",Who invented the nuclear reactor?,Enrico Permi's,1143
"An elephant is a herbivorous (leaf-eating) mammal. It is the largest of all land animals. It is also very long-lived (~70 years). It is the longest living land animal besides humans. Elephants are very strong. The beasts of prey and the highest in the food hierarchy of wild animals, the lion (Arima), the tiger, etc., are unapproachable in strength. Lions gang up and kill a tired or young elephant that might come alone. However, such incidents are very rare. Elephants live in families. Also, they have high memory capacity. Only three elephants remain in the world today. They are African bush elephants, African forest elephants and Asian elephants. There are significant differences between them. Generally, all elephants live up to about 70 years. A male elephant is called Kaliru. A female elephant is called Bd. A baby elephant is called a calf or cub. The sound made by an elephant is called bellowing. Elephant Species African elephants are larger in stature than Asian elephants. They have large ear lobes. Both male and female African elephants have tusks. However, ivory is rarely found in Asian female elephants. The back of African elephants curves slightly inwards behind the head and is flat without raised forehead ridges. These have two petals at the apex of the thallus. But the front feet have four or five claws and the hind feet have three claws. Asian elephants have slightly raised backs. There are two ridges on the forehead and small ear lobes. There is only one petal at the apex of the thallus (upper margin). The front feet have five claws and the hind feet have four claws. Food and Habitat Elephants are herbivores or herbivores. They like to eat bamboo and sugarcane. They spend 16 hours a day gathering food. Also, their digestive capacity is very slow. Therefore, 40 percent of these foods are digested. Hence, they tend to consume a lot of food. Well-grown elephants consume about 140 to 270 kg of food per day. Physique Male elephants are typically 3 meters tall and weigh 6000 kilograms. Elephant skin is very thick. There will be a thickness of about 3 cm. However, it will be slow. Thus, mosquitoes etc. will also bite. An elephant has four strong legs. Despite its bulky body, the elephant can climb and descend hills and steep places efficiently. The proverb ""the foot of an elephant glides"" is a reference to the elephant's ability to walk in long ups and downs. Trunk The special feature of an elephant is its trunk. It is best seen only in elephants. Although a few animals have a slightly elongated frontal nose (like the proboscis monkey), there are no animals with long trunk-like limbs. The trunk is made up of a total of 40,000 muscles. It is flexible in all directions. At the tip of the trunk are the nostrils through which the elephant breathes, and tiny, highly sensitive fingertips.[1] The trunk can lift anything from a small stick to a large tree. They usually help in picking up food and drinking water. The elephant repels attacks from hostile animals with its trunk. Because the neck is short the prominence of the trunk is great. Tusk Elephants have two tusks. These are called elephant lines. This elephant coat is present only in male elephants (Kalurukku) in Asiatic Indian elephants and not in female elephants (Pitukku). But African wild elephants, both male and female, have a stripe (both male and female). The elephants living in Sumatra and Borneo, the elephants of Sri Lanka, are bisexual (Kaliru, Pd) and often have an elephant line. An elephant's tusk is an extension of an elephant's molars. Hence these are also called elephant's tusks or tusks (tusks and tusks mean teeth). Tusks can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet). And they can weigh up to 90 kilograms. These tusks are also used for trade. In March 2015, Ethiopia burned six tons of ivory taken from several elephants.[2] Leather Elephant skin is very thick. Thick skin is found in most parts of the body. The skin is about two and a half centimeters thick. However, the skin around its mouth and inside the ear is thin. Asian elephants generally have more hair on their skin than African elephants. Elephants usually smear mud or dirt all over their bodies. This is an important characteristic of elephant society. It helps to protect the skin of the elephant from the sun's heat and radiation. Although the elephant's skin is thick, it is very sensitive. This is why elephants spit mud or dirt after bathing. Legs They have strong legs to support the elephant's large body. They don't need much muscle power to stand because of their straight legs and wide feet. So they can stand for a long time without resting. African elephants often do not sit unless they are sick or injured. But Asian elephants rest often. The elephant has got a broad round foot (foot). The African elephant has three tusks (claws) on its hind legs and four on its front legs. The Asian elephant has four tusks on the hind legs and five on the front legs. Elephants can swim and climb well. These cannot be jumped. Ears Elephants have very large broad lobed ears. They play an important role in maintaining the elephant's body temperature. Elephant's ears are full of blood vessels. The ambient air cools down as the heated blood flows into the ears. Then it goes into the body and lowers the temperature. Due to blood circulation, this process is continuous and the temperature is kept under control. This is why elephants are always seen moving their ears. The upper margin of a grown elephant's ear is folded outward in the Asian elephant, and curled inward in the African elephant.[3] Cognition The elephant's brain is the largest of all land animals. It weighs a little over five kilograms. Elephants have good memory. After elephants and dolphins, elephants are considered to be the most intelligent animals. Elephants are said to be second to humans in intelligence. Elephant brains are also superior in structure and technique. They also learn to use tools. Elephants are generally compassionate.[4] Sensory Sense Elephants have excellent hearing and sense of smell. The elephant's eye is slightly myopic. Thus, an elephant relies on its keen sense of hearing and subtle sense of smell rather than its sight.[5] Their trunks are also sensitive. Not only their ears but also their trunks are capable of sensing vibrations. Their feet are capable of sensing very low frequency sound waves. Social Life The social life of greens is different from the life of pits. Embryos live with their mother's group until they reach puberty, then mostly alone. But the Bds live as a well-knit family of mother, sister and daughter. Adolescence is also observed during the breeding season. Self-awareness Elephants are self-aware. It is established by glass testing. Elephants recognize themselves when placed in front of a mirror. This ability has so far only been found in baboons, some monkeys, and dolphins. A study conducted among domesticated elephants in Zimbabwe suggests that elephants have the ability to understand a person's pointing.[6] A breeding elephant has a gestation period of 22 months. This is the longest gestation period in mammals. They usually give birth to only one calf. Twins are very rare. A newborn baby elephant weighs between 90 – 115 kilograms. Before, during, and after calving, the elephant is greatly assisted by the presence of other adult elephants. From birth, the calf is raised by the herd. Threats Poaching A major threat to elephants is poaching. Elephants are hunted for their tusks. Large, long-lived and slow-breeding elephants, over-hunting has a major impact. They are large and cannot be hidden easily. Each elephant takes years to grow and breed. Each elephant needs an average of 140 kilograms (300 pounds) of leaves per day. Due to the destruction of large animals like tigers and lions, small herbivores competing for elephants' food are multiplying and destroying plants, making it difficult for elephants to get food. Elephants are rarely killed for food by animals other than humans. Habitat Shrinkage Another important threat is the destruction of elephant habitats. Humans are destroying elephant habitats for agricultural expansion. This creates conflicts between the interests of humans and the interests of elephants. For example, elephants enter new agricultural settlements, destroying crops and endangering lives of people. An average of 150 elephants and 100 humans die in Sri Lanka every year due to such conflicts. Deforestation also reduces the habitat of elephants. Habitat loss is said to be the primary reason for the extinction of Asian elephants. Elephants require large areas of forest to survive. Because elephants enter an area in droves and destroy trees and plant vines. Then they go somewhere else. Thus the destroyed forests go to new places and re-grow and come back to the same place and get food. As habitats shrink, food runs out very quickly.[7] Humans and Elephants As elephants are killed legally and against the law by humans, there are unintended consequences for elephants' physiology. Ivory poachers in Africa hunt elephants with large tusks, leaving the remaining elephants with small tusks or no tusks. Newly born cubs are also more likely to be born with these, leading to the addition of tuskless genes in new generations, leading to the birth of large numbers of tuskless elephants. The number of such elephants has increased from 1% in 1930 to 30% in some areas. Edentulism was once a rare genetic mutation and is now becoming a common hereditary trait. Mortality Elephants can die of heart failure, heart attack, and cerebral hemorrhage.[8] Elephant in Sangam Literature In Tamil Sangam literature, the elephant is mentioned in more than 170 names.

"Bangalore (Kannada: बंगालूर) is the capital of the state of Karnataka. Located in the south-eastern part of Karnataka on the Deccan Plateau, it is the third most populous city in India[1] and the fifth largest in terms of urban population density. Many consider the city's modern history to begin in 1537, when Kempe Gowda, considered by many to be the first architect of modern Bangalore, built a brick-and-mortar fort on the site and established it as a region of the Vijayanagara Empire. During the British rule, it became the center of colonial rule in South India. Today, Bengaluru is a major developing metropolis, home to many of India's most prestigious colleges and research institutes. A large number of public sector heavy industries, software companies, aerospace, telecommunications, and defense sector companies are located in the city. Bengaluru is known as the 'Silicon Valley' of India due to its proud position as the country's leader in IT employment and exports.[2] With its diverse population, Bengaluru is a major economic hub and one of the fastest growing cities in India. In 2015, the name was changed to Bengaluru.[3] Name History The name Bangalore, which is an anglicization of the city name Bangalore, was used until a few years ago. The earliest reference to the name ""Bangalore"" is found in inscriptions carved on a ninth-century Western Ganga Dynasty ""Veerak Kal"" (stone inscriptions extolling the merits of a hero). In this inscription found at Begar, ""Bangalore"" is mentioned as a place where the battle took place in 890 AD. This place was a part of the Ganga empire. It was called Bengaval-uru, meaning ""City of Guards"" in Halegannada (Old Kannada).[4] An article in The Hindu says: [5] An inscription dating back to 890 AD shows that Bangalore is more than 1,000 years old. But this inscription lies unattended in the Parvati Nageswara temple at Bekur near the city...Written in Hale Kannada (Old Kannada) language, this inscription refers to the Battle of Bengaluru in 890 AD. Although it was recorded by the historian R. Narasimhachar in his Compendium of Carnatic Petroglyphs (Vol. 10 Supplement), no efforts have been made to preserve it. An old story, famous even if anecdotal, recalls: The Hoysala king of the 11th century Viravalala II, while out hunting, forgot his way through the forest. While hungry and tired, he met a poor old woman. The old lady served him some unripe rice. The king gratefully named the place ""Benda-kal-uru"" (Kannada: Bendakalur) (literally, ""city of unripe beans""). It eventually became ""Bangalore"".[6][7] On 11 December 2005, Jnana Peetha awardee U.R. was appointed to change the name Bangalore to Bengaluru. The Karnataka government announced that it had accepted an idea presented by Ananthamurthy.[8] On 27 September 2006, the Purugath Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) passed a resolution to implement the proposed name change.[9] The decision was accepted by the Government of Karnataka and the name change was officially implemented on November 1, 2006.[10][11] However, the process was somewhat stalled due to delays in getting approval from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.[12] History After hundreds of years of rule by the Upper Gangars, Bengaluru was captured by the Cholas in 1024 AD and then fell to the Chalukya-Cholas in 1070 AD. In 1116, the Hoysala Empire overthrew the Cholas and extended its rule to Bangalore. Modern Bengaluru was founded by Kempe Gowda I, one of the tenants of the Vijayanagara Empire. He built a brick-and-mortar fort and a Nandi temple in the vicinity of modern Bangalore in 1537. Kempe Gowda referred to the new city as ""Kandubhumi"" or ""Land of Heroes"".[7] Within the Bengaluru fort, the city was divided into small divisions - each called a ""patte"" (camp). The city had two main streets. Chikkapete Road ran east-west and Thottapete Road ran north-south. The point where these intersected formed Thottapete Square, the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda's successor, Kempe Gowda II, built the four famous towers that mark the boundaries of Bangalore.[13] During Vijayanagara rule, Bengaluru was also known as ""Devarayanagara"" and ""Kalyanapura"" (""Magnificent City""). After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, the rule of Bangalore changed hands. In 1638, a large Bijapur force led by Ranatullah Khan along with Shaji Bhonsle defeated Kempe Gowda III. Bangalore was gifted to Shahji. In 1687, he defeated the Mughal general Qasim Khan Shahji's son Ekoji and sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodiyar (1673–1704) of Mysore for 300,000 rupees.[14][15] After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759, Hyder Ali, the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, declared himself the de facto ruler of Mysore. Later the rule passed to Tipu Sultan, son of Hyder Ali, known as the Tiger of Mysore. Bengaluru was eventually annexed to the British Indian Empire after Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799). The British handed over the administrative control of Bengaluru ""Bede"" to the Emperor of Mysore, keeping only the Cantonment under their control. The 'seat' of the Mysore kingdom was first established in Mysore in 1799. Then it was shifted to Bangalore in 1804. During this period it was easy for the British to recruit laborers from the Madras Presidency and transfer them to the Cantonment area. The Kingdom of Mysore shifted its capital from Mysore to Bangalore in 1831.[16] Two major developments of this period contributed to the rapid growth of the city: one of them was the introduction of telegraph links and the other was the railway connection to Madras in 1864. Bangalore became a twin city in the 19th century. The ""Bede"" residents were mostly Kannada. The residents of the ""Cantonment"" area created by the British were overwhelmingly Tamil.[17] In 1898, a plague epidemic broke out in Bangalore. This greatly reduced the population of the city. New expansion areas of Malleswara and Basavanagudi were created to the north and south of 'Bede'. Telephone wires were laid to coordinate epidemic prevention measures. A Health Officer was also appointed in 1898. In 1906, Bangalore became the first city in India to get electricity. Electricity is sourced from a hydroelectric plant located at Sivasamudra. Bangalore's fame as India's garden city began in 1927 during the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the reign of Krishnaraja Vodiyar IV. Parks, buildings and hospitals were built to beautify the city. After India's independence in August 1947, Bengaluru continued to be part of the new Mysore Kingdom, with the Maharaja of Mysore as its head. Public sector jobs and education created opportunities for Kannadas from other parts of the state to migrate into the city. Bengaluru saw rapid growth during the decades 1941-51 and 1971-81. This led to the migration of many people from North Karnataka to the city. By 1961, Bangalore was the sixth largest city in India with a population of 1,207,000.[13] In the following eras, Bangalore's manufacturing base continued to expand with the emergence of many private companies in the city. Bengaluru saw a boom in its real estate market in the 1980s and 1990s. This development was fueled by capital investors from other parts of the country converting Bangalore's large number of vacant plots and houses into high-rises.[18] In 1985, Texas Instruments was the first multinational company to set up its base in Bangalore. Other IT companies followed suit. By the end of the 20th century, Bangalore was firmly establishing itself as the Silicon Valley of India. Geographically Bengaluru is located in the South East of the South Indian state of Karnataka. It lies at an average elevation of 920 m (3,018 ft) on the Mysore Plateau (part of the vast pre-Cambrian Deccan Plateau in the heartland). It is 741 km² (286 mi²).[19] Located in the area. Major part of Bengaluru city is located in Bengaluru city district of Karnataka. The surrounding rural areas are part of Bengaluru Village District. The Karnataka government has created a new district called Ramanagara from the old Bengaluru village district. There is no major river running through the city. However, about 60 km (37 mi) to the north, the Archavati River meets the Tenpenna River at Nandi Hill. A small tributary of Argavati River, Virtsapavati River originates in Basavanagudi within the city and flows through the city. The Arkawati and Vridhapavati rivers together carry the bulk of Bangalore's waste. A sewage system built in 1922 covers 215 km² (133 mi²) of the city and connects five sewage treatment plants located on the outskirts of Bangalore.[20] In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed several lakes to meet the city's water needs. The most prominent of these lakes was the Kempembudi Gere. During the early 20th century, Nandi Hills Waterworks was established by Sir Mirza Ismail (Mysore Diwan, 1926-41 AD) to supply water to the city. Currently Cauvery River contributes about 80% of the city's water supply. The remaining 20% ​​is Thippakondanahalli and Hesaraghatta are obtained from the reservoirs of the Argavati River.[21] Bengaluru receives 800 million liters (211 million US gallons) of water per day. This is more than any other Indian city.[22] However, Bengaluru faces water scarcity at times especially during summer seasons. Bengaluru has many fresh water lakes and ponds. Major among them are Madiwala Lake, Heppel Lake, Alsur Lake and Sangki Lake. Groundwater appears from the silt and sand layers of sedimentary deposits. As far as the flora of the city is concerned, there is a large number of deciduous trees and a small number of coconut trees. Although Bengaluru is classified as a second-tier (a stable zone) earthquake zone, it has seen earthquakes as large as 4.5 on the Richter scale.[23] Due to its high altitude climate, Bengaluru enjoys mostly pleasant weather throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can cause discomfort in summer.[24] January is the coldest month. The average minimum temperature is 15.1°C. April is the hottest month. The average high temperature is 33.6°C.[25] The highest temperature recorded in Bangalore was 38.9°C. The lowest recorded temperature was 7.8°C (January 1884).[26][27] Winter temperatures rarely fall below 12°C. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 36–37°C (100°F). Bengaluru receives rainfall from both the northeast and southwest monsoons. September, October and August are the wettest months respectively.[25] Summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms. It also causes power outages and localized flooding from time to time. The highest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period was 179 millimeters (7.0in) on October 1, 1997.[28] City Administration The Purugath Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is responsible for the administration of the city.[29] Purugath is run by the Bangalore Mahanagara Balike Metropolitan Council. Councilors are elected from each ward. Assembly elections are held every 5 years. A mayor and commissioner of the council are elected on the basis of reservation. This seat is reserved for a woman candidate from Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes or Other Backward Classes. Bangalore's rapid growth has created many problems related to traffic congestion and aging infrastructure. These are challenging issues for Bengaluru Mahanagara Balike to address. The 2003 Bethel Environmental Assessment System (BEES) of Bengaluru's physical, biological and socio-economic metrics indicated that Bengaluru's water quality and regional and aquatic ecosystems are near ideal. The city's socioeconomic metrics (traffic congestion, quality of life) scored low.[30] The unplanned growth of the city resulted in a major traffic crisis. The Corporation tried to solve this problem by constructing a flyover system and one-way roads. Although some flyovers and one-way roads have helped alleviate traffic congestion to some extent, they have not been able to compensate for the tremendous growth in urban traffic.[30] In 2005, both the central government and the state government allocated a significant amount in their annual budget allocations for the development of Bangalore's infrastructure.[31] Bengaluru Mahanagara Polike works in collaboration with Bengaluru Development Corporation (BDA) and Bengaluru Planning Task Force (BATF) in designing and implementing city development plans. Bengaluru generates 3,000 tonnes of solid waste per day. Of this, 1,139 tonnes are collected and sent to waste disposal units such as the Karnataka Sewage Development Board. The remaining solid waste is dumped by the municipality in open spaces or on roadsides outside the city.[32] Bengaluru City Police (BCP) consists of six geographical zones including Traffic Police, City Armed Police, Central Crime Branch and City Crime Records Branch. It also operates 86 police stations, including two all-women police stations.[33] As the capital of the state of Karnataka, Bengaluru is home to the main state government institutions such as the Karnataka High Court, the Karnataka Legislative Assembly and the Karnataka Governor's House. Bengaluru contributes three members to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India, and 28 members to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly.[34] The electricity system in Bangalore is controlled by the Karnataka Power Distribution Corporation (KPTCL). Like many cities in India, Bengaluru has a notified blackout. Especially during summers. It is necessary for power supply companies to meet the consumption of both household needs and corporate needs. Economy Bangalore's economy (2002–03 gross district revenue) makes it a major economic center of India.[35] With an economic growth of 10.3%, Bengaluru is the fastest growing major city in India.[36] Additionally, Bengaluru is India's fourth largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market.[37] The city is home to more than 10,000 dollar millionaires and is the third largest center for the number of high net worth individuals. It also has about 60,000 super-rich people with investable surplus.[38] By 2001, Bangalore's contribution to foreign direct investment was the fourth largest among Indian cities.[39] In 1940, industrial pioneers Sir Mirza Ismail and Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya played an important role in developing Bangalore's strong manufacturing and industrial base. Many public sector organizations have their headquarters in Bangalore. In June 1972, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was created under the Department of Space and headquartered in the city. India's second and third largest software companies Infosys and Wipro have their headquarters in Bangalore. Bengaluru is known as the Silicon Valley of India due to the large number of IT companies located in the city. These contributed 33% of India's ₹144,214 crore (US$20billion) 2006–07 IT services exports.[40] The development of information technology has also presented unique challenges to the city. Clashes sometimes occur between the city's IT companies, which demand improvements in the city's infrastructure, and the state government, which has the rural population of Karnataka as its main vote bank.[41] Bangalore is the hub of biotechnology related industries in India. In 2005, about 47% of India's 265 biotech companies were located here; These include India's largest biotechnology company, Biocon.[42][43] Transportation The newly constructed Bengaluru International Airport (ATA code: BLR) in Bengaluru commenced its operations from 24 May 2008. Earlier the city was served by HAL Airport. It was the fourth busiest airport in India.[44][45][46] Air Deccan and Kingfisher Airlines have their headquarters in Bangalore.[47] A rapid transit system called Namma Metro has been developed and operationalized. At completion it will comprise 41 stops and an over- and under-ground train network.[48] Bengaluru is well connected with other cities of the country through Indian Railways. Rajdhani Express connects the city with the Indian capital New Delhi. Bengaluru is also connected to many cities in Karnataka, as well as Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and other major cities in India, via the reserve route.[49] Three-wheeled, black and yellow automatic tricycles called autos are popular for motorized transport.[50]] These are metered and carry up to three passengers. Rental services are also available for a small additional fee.[50] Buses operated by the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) are also a mode of public transport in the city.[51] Passengers can get tickets while traveling in these buses. The transport corporation also provides bus advance pass facility for frequent commuters. The transport corporation also operates air-conditioned, red Volvo buses on major routes.[51] The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation operates 6,600 buses on 5,700 timetables connecting Bangalore to other parts of Karnataka and other states.[52] Demographics Bengaluru is the third largest city in India by population and the 28th largest city in the world. In 2009 the population was estimated at 5,300,000.[53] Bengaluru was the fastest growing Indian city after New Delhi during 1991-2001. The growth rate during this decade was 38%. Bangaloreans are referred to as Bangaloreans in English and Bengalurunavaru in Kannada. Kannada speakers constitute about 39% of the city's population.[54][55] Due to the multicultural nature of the city, people from other states come and settle in Bengaluru.[56] Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes constitute 14.3% of the city's population. Apart from Kannada and English, Tamil, Telugu and Hindi are other major languages ​​spoken in the city.[57] According to the 2001 India Census, 79.37% of Bengaluru's population is Hindu. This is roughly in line with the national average.[58] Muslims constitute 13.37% of the population. This is also roughly in line with the national average. Christians and Jains constitute 5.79% and 1.05% of the population respectively. This is double the national average for these religions. Anglo-Indians are also a significant community in the city. Women constitute 47.5% of Bengaluru's population. Bengaluru has the second highest literacy rate (83%) among Indian cities after Mumbai. About 10% of Bangalore's population lives in slums[59]. This is relatively low compared to Mumbai and other cities in developing countries such as Nairobi.[60] The 2004 National Crime Records Bureau points out that Bengaluru accounts for 9.2% of the total crime reported among India's 35 largest cities. Delhi and Mumbai contribute 15.7% and 9.5% respectively.[61] Culturally Bengaluru is known as the ""Garden City of India""[62]. This is because it has many public parks including Lal Bagh and Kappan Park. The government festival is Dussehra, a traditional celebration symbol of the erstwhile Mysore Empire. This festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm. The city celebrates one of the most important ancient festivals of Bangalore called ""Karaka Shaktiyotsava"" or Bengaluru Karaka.[63] Diwali, the ""Festival of Lights"" is another major festival celebrated across lifestyle and religious lines. Other traditional Indian festivals such as Vinayagar Chaturthi, Ugadi, Sankranti, Eid-ul-Fitr, and Christmas are also celebrated here. Bengaluru is the home of the Kannada screen world. Around 80 Kannada films are released every year from here.[64] Late actor Dr. Rajkumar is one of the most prominent contributors to the Kannada film industry. Culinary diversity reflects Bangalore's social and economic diversity. Rotorua stalls, tea stalls, and South Indian, North Indian, Chinese and Western fast food are popular in the city. Udupi restaurants are very popular. These primarily serve regional vegetarian dishes. Bengaluru is also a major center of Indian classical music and dance. Traditional music and dance concerts are widely held throughout the year especially during Ramnavami and Vinayagar Chaturthi festivals. The city also has a vibrant Kannada theater movement. Organizations like Ranga Sankara are taking this forward. Bangalore has also become one of the premier venues for international rock concerts.[65] Sports Batting is one of the most popular sports in Bangalore. Many national batsmen have hailed from Bangalore, including former Indian captains Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, and Robin Uthappa and many others. Many boys can be seen playing roadside cricket on the roads and in many public places of the city. Bangalore's premier global batting stadium M. Chinnaswamy Arena is there. It has a seating capacity of 40,000[66]. 1987 Cricket World Cup, 1996 Cricket World Cup and 2011 Cricket World Cup were played here. Indian Premier League (IPL) affiliate Bangalore Royal Challengers and Premier Hockey League (PHL) affiliate Bangalore High-Flyers are based in the city. India's Davis Cup tennis team members Mahesh Bhupathi[67] and Rogan Bopanna[68] also reside in Bangalore. The city hosts the Bangalore Open of the Women's Tennis Association every year. Beginning in September 2008, the annual Kingfisher Airlines Tennis Open ATP tournament is also held in Bangalore.[69] Other sports celebrities from Bangalore include national swimming champion Nisha Millet, world snooker champion Pankaj Advani and former All England Open badminton champion Prakash Padukone. Education Until the early 19th century, education in Bangalore was mainly run by religious leaders and was limited to students of that religion.[70] Western education system was introduced during the rule of Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. Two schools were established in Bangalore. Following this, the Wesleyan Mission established a school in 1851. In 1858 Bangalore High School was started by Govt.[71] In post-independence India, schools for young children have undergone a transformation.[72] There are various schools in Bangalore that provide primary and secondary education under one of the education boards such as School Leaving Certificate (SSLC), Indian Certificate of Secondary Education and Board of Intermediate Secondary Education.[73] Bengaluru schools are either government schools or private schools (government aided and non-government aided).[74] After completing their secondary education, students usually pursue pre-university PUC courses in one of three disciplines: Arts, Commerce or Science.[75] After completing the required course, students can continue their studies by enrolling in general or technical courses in universities. Established in 1964, Bangalore University provides affiliation to around 500 colleges. The total number of students is more than 300,000. The university has two campuses within Bangalore, Gnanabharati and Central College.[76] The Indian Institute of Science, established in Bangalore in 1909, is India's premier institution for scientific research and study.[77] National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIM-B) and Indian Institute of Statistical Research are also located in Bangalore. India's premier mental health institution is also located in Bangalore.[77] National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), a premier mental health institute, is located in Bangalore. Media The first printing press was established in Bangalore in 1840.[78] In 1859, the Bengaluru Herald was the first bi-weekly English newspaper to be published in Bengaluru[79]. In 1860, the Mysore Virutina Bodhini became the first Kannada newspaper to be sold in Bangalore.[78] Currently, Vijaya Karnataka and The Times of India are the largest selling newspapers in Bengaluru in Kannada and English respectively. Close to these are Prajavani and Deccan Herald.[80][81] All India Radio, the official broadcaster of the Government of India, began broadcasting from its Bangalore station in 1955.[82] Radio City was the first private commercial radio station to broadcast in Bangalore.[83] In recent years, a number of traditional stations have started broadcasting from Bangalore.[84] Doordarshan established its broadcasting center here on 1 November 1981 and began broadcasting.[85] A production center was established in 1983 at Doordarshan's Bangalore office. This was followed by the launch of a news program in Kannada from 19 November 1983.[85] Doordarshan also launched a Kannada satellite channel on 15 August 1991. It is now named DD Santana.[85] Private news channels set foot in Bangalore in September 1991 when Star TV's channels started broadcasting.[86] Although the number of satellite televisions available in Bangalore has grown exponentially over the years[87], this growth has also led to occasional conflicts between television spectrum distributors.[88] Bengaluru STPI was the first internet service provider to start in Bangalore. The company started providing Internet services in the early 1990s.[89] However, this internet service was mostly used by corporations. This changed only after VSNL introduced public telephone wireline internet services in late 1995.[90] Bengaluru is now the city with the highest number of broadband internet connections in India.[91] Bangalore tourist sites for additional viewing Karnataka Our metro REFERENCES FURTHER READING Hasan, Fazlul.

"Australia, Australia or Australasia (Australia) is a country that includes the world's smallest continent and the world's largest island, the mainland, the island of Tasmania, and some small islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia. It has no land border with any country. Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea are its neighbors to the north, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia to the north-east and New Zealand to the south-east. History tells us that Aboriginal Australians have lived on the Australian mainland for nearly 42,000 years[1]. After occasional fishermen from the north, and later Dutch explorers from Europe in 1606[2], the British landed in the eastern part of Australia in 1770 and claimed it for the United Kingdom. The colony of New South Wales was created on January 26, 1788, initially as a settlement scheme for English and Scottish convicts. Later, as the population grew, more new areas of Australia were discovered and five more autonomous British colonies were established during the 19th century. On 1 January 1901 the six separate colonies united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, a federal government with an open democratic constitution. Its capital is Canberra. Despite being the sixth largest country by area, it has a population of just 23.2 million (2.32 crore, 2013 estimate[3]). 60 percent of them live in mainland areas around state capitals. Australia follows Western economic systems. Per capita income is on par with strong economies. Only 5% of the workforce is engaged in agriculture. A country rich in oil and minerals. Origin of Name The name Australia is derived from the Latin word Australis. The concept is south. In 1521 the Spaniard became the first European to sail across the Pacific Ocean. The word Australia was first used in the English language in 1625.[4] In 1638 the Dutch East India Company, based in Jakarta, named their new discovery further south Australische. The name ""Australia"" came into widespread use in 1814 when Matthew Flinders, the first British sailor to circumnavigate Australia, used the name ""Australia"" in his book A Voyage to Terra Australis. New South Wales Governor Lachlan Macquarie recommended the name to the colonial government on 12 December 1817[5]. The name was adopted in 1824. In Australian English ""Australia"" is pronounced as əˈstɹæɪljə, -liːə, -jə[6]. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Australia has been referred to locally and internationally as Oz and Australians as Aussie. History Australian Aborigines Studies date the first human settlement of Australia between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago [7]. They are now known as the ancestors of the tribes in Australia. Evidence has been confirmed that they were at Laje Mungo in New South Wales. Although inhabited by humans since before the Stone Age, they are believed to have separated from the present-day Southeast Asian islands very early. Genetically and linguistically, the relationship and relationship of these tribes (with other nationalities) is not confirmed. Majority of these tribes are hunter-gatherers. Melanesians are a tribe living in far-north Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands. Their culture and lifestyle are different from other tribes. Arrival of the European The first European to reach the Australian mainland was the Dutch sailor Willem Jansoon. He sighted the shores of Cape York Peninsula in 1606. During the 17th century the Dutch settled on the western and northern shores and named the area Nova Hollandia. But they did not try to settle there. In 1770, English Captain James Cook during his Pacific voyage landed on the east coast of Australia and claimed it for Great Britain, naming it New South Wales. His discoveries later led to British convict settlement there. The monarchical colony of New South Wales was founded on January 26, 1788 in Jackson's Department by Arthur Phillip. This day was later named Australia Day as Australia's national day. Settlement in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania) began in 1803 and became a separate colony in 1825.[8] The western part of Australia (the Swan River Settlement) was officially claimed by the United Kingdom in 1829. In 1832 the region became known as Western Australia. The separate colonies of South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859 were separated from New South Wales. In 1911, the Northern Territory separated from South Australia and became a separate state. South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia did not begin as British convict settlements. However, Victoria and Western Australia later began accepting convicts[9] and sent convicts to New South Wales was stopped in 1848 after opposition from settlers.[10] When Europeans first settled here in 1788, approximately 350,000 tribes lived on the continent[11]. At that time 500 types of tribes were living in this continent with their own language. Their numbers began to decline drastically over the next 150 years. Infectious disease, forced resettlement, cultural adjustment etc. are considered to be the main reasons for this [12]. Researchers believe that forced eviction of tribal children from their families is also the reason for this decline [13]. Following a referendum in 1967, the central government was empowered to make policy changes and enact new laws regarding tribals. Native title was not recognized in Australia until 1992. Following the famous Mabo v Queensland case heard in the High Court of Australia, lands under European occupation were previously considered terra nullius (""empty land"") and land titles were given to those who had held the land for generations. Federation During the period 1855 - 1890, the six colonies formed their own governments and began to look after their own local affairs as if they were within the British Empire. The colonial administration based in London was particularly concerned with foreign affairs, defense and international shipping. On 1 January 1901, the Australian Confederation was established. A ""Commonwealth of Australia"" was born within the British Empire. In 1911, part of the state of New South Wales was separated into a separate territory called the Australian Capital Territory, and the capital of the federation, Canberra, was established here in 1927. Until then Melbourne was the temporary capital of the Confederation. The Northern Territory, which was part of South Australia, was separated in 1911 and brought under Central Government. Australia entered the war voluntarily in World War I[14]. Australian participation in the Battle of Gallipoli was the country's first major military engagement. Despite their defeat, the move is seen by most Australians as a national uprising. In the United Kingdom, the Act of Westminster 1931, enacted in 1931, maintained the constitutional relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom, but a 1942 bye-law ended the 1931 Act. The United Kingdom's shocking defeats in Asia during World War II in 1942 and the collapse of the Japanese Empire provided Australia with an opportunity to align with the United States. Since 1951, Australia has had a defense treaty with the United States called Ansus. After the Second World War, people from Europe were allowed to settle in Australia. People from Asia and non-European countries were encouraged to immigrate here from the 1970s after the end of the White Australia policy. After this there was a great change in the heritage, culture, and self-determination of the people of Australia. The constitutional link between Australia and the United Kingdom was further split in 1986 following the passage of the Australia Act 1986. After this act was passed, Britain's role in the Australian states came to an end. An appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom was barred[15]. In a 1999 referendum on Australia becoming a republic, 54 percent voted against. Political Commonwealth Australia is a parliamentary democracy with a middle-class government. Elizabeth II is Queen of Australia. In the interim rule, the Queen has appointed a Governor-General and separate Governors for the respective states on her behalf. Although the Governor-General has many executive powers under the Constitution, he usually exercises his powers on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia. Only once, in 1975, did the Governor-General arbitrarily remove the then Whitlam government[16]. A total of three governmental bodies operate in Australia: Legislature: Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Governor, Senate and People's Representatives are part of it. The Governor-General participates on behalf of the Governor. Executive Council: The Central Executive Council consists of the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet. Law: High Court and Arbitral Tribunals of Australia. Appeals to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom ceased in 1986. The bicameral Parliament of Australia consists of 76 members in the Senate (upper) and 150 members in the House of Representatives (lower). Below Members One member is elected from each constituency. The Upper House has 12 members from each state, two from each of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Elections to both houses are held once in three years. The party with the lowest number of members forms the government. Its leader is elected as the Prime Minister. States and Territories Western Australia Northern Territory South Australia Queensland New South Wales Australian Capital Territory Victoria Tasmania Indian Ocean Timor Sea Gulf of Carpentry Arafura Seea Great Australian Bight Tasman Sea Bass Strait Coral Sea ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● South Pacific Ocean Southern Ocean Great Barrier Reef Australia is a self-governing country consisting of six states, two territories and a few other small territories. The states are: New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania. The two main regions are the Northern Region and the Australian Capital Territory. Although the functions of the territories are generally similar to those of the states, the constitution of the territories can be changed by the central government (Australian Government). Whereas the Central Government can only change the provisions of Article 51 (Special) Acts of the State Governments. Hospitals, education, police, law, roads, public transport, local government etc. are under the control of state governments. Each state and territory has its own separate assemblies (parliaments). Among these, the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Queensland have one assembly, while other states have two lower and upper assemblies. The head of government of the states is called the Prime Minister and the head of the regions is called the Chief Minister. The Queen appoints a Governor in each state and an Administrator in the Northern Zone as her representative. There are also some smaller territories in Australia. Jervis Island is a naval base located in the state of New South Wales and is administered by the Commonwealth of Nations. In addition to these, the following territories are controlled by Australia: Norfolk Island Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands Ashmore Cartier Islands Coral Sea Islands Hart Island and Macdonald Islands Australian Antarctic Territory Geography Australia is located on the Indo-Australian Plateau surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans and separated from the Asian continent by the Arabian and Timor seas. Covering an area of ​​7,617,930 square kilometers[17], most of the country is desert. Australia's land mass consists of 34,218 km of coastline (excluding islands)[18]. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest barrier reef[19], is found off the northeast coast of Australia. Its length is more than 2000 km. Mount Augustus in Western Australia is considered the world's largest monolith[20]. At 2,228m, Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain in mainland Australia. Mount Mosan is 2,745 m high in the territory of Hart Island and Macdonald Islands off the Peruvian mainland. Australia is the flattest continent. It is the driest of the human-inhabited continents, with old and poor soils. Most Australians live along the southeast coast of the country. The northern part of the country is a tropical region. There are rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, deciduous forests, and deserts. Climate change has become a major issue in Australia in recent times[21]. Although rainfall has increased over the past century[22], much of Australia remains water-scarce. Due to population growth in cities, and local droughts, water restrictions are in effect in many cities[23]. The majority of the population's current (2008) estimated 21.3 million Australians are descendants of people who came from Europe during the colonial and pre-federal period. Most of them are immigrants from the British Isles. Even today, the majority of Australians are of British and Irish descent. Australia's population has quadrupled since the First World War[25]. This strengthened the support for the immigration plan. After World War II, and from then until 2000, nearly 5.9 million people immigrated. That means almost two in seven Australians are foreign-born[26]. Most of the immigrants were skilled in some field[27], although family members and refugees were allowed to immigrate.[27] According to a 2001 estimate, the majority of foreign-born were born in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Vietnam, and China[28]. After the abandonment of the White Australia policy in 1973, several programs were introduced at the government level to promote inter-racial unity based on multiculturalism[29]. In 2005–06, more than 131,000 people immigrated to Australia. The majority of these are from Asia and the changing Oceania regions[30]. In 2006–07 the number of immigrants was estimated at 144,000[31]. 300,000 people are planned to be accommodated during 2008-9. This is the largest number of immigrants since World War II[32]. In 2001 the number of Aboriginal people in mainland Australia (Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) was 410,003. This is 2.2% of the country's total. This is 115,953 more than in 1976. Arrests, unemployment, illiteracy, etc. are the problems faced by the Australian aborigines. Their average life expectancy is up to 17 years shorter than other non-Indigenous Australians[33]. As in other developed countries, Australia's population appears to be aging. More are seen as retirees and a smaller proportion as professionals. The median age of the population in 2004 was 38.8 years[34]. A large number of Australians (759,849 in 2002–03)[35] lived outside their country of birth. Language English is a national language here[36]. The majority speak Australian English. It resembles British English but has some pronunciation and vocabulary unique to Australians. Grammar and spelling are similar to British English. According to a 2001 survey, English was the language spoken at home by 80 percent. followed by Chinese (2.1%), Italian (1.9%), and Greek (1.4%). The majority of immigrants here are bilingual. Around 200 or 300 language-speaking tribes are believed to have lived here at the time of European settlement. Only 70 of these are in the case today. Almost 50,000 (0.25%) people have an indigenous language as their first language. Religion There is no official religion in Australia. According to a 2006 survey, 64% of Australians identified themselves as Christian. Of these, 26% follow Roman Catholicism and 19% follow Anglicanism. 19% identified as not belonging to our religion. 12% did not identify themselves religiously. Christians are followed by 2.1% Buddhists, 1.7% Muslims, 0.8% Hindus and 0.5% Jews. Less than 6% of the total are non-Christian[37]. As in other Western countries, there are few people who go to Christian churches. 1.5 million people attend churches weekly. This is 7.5% of the total population[38]. Education In Australia, schooling is compulsory from age 6 to age 15 (age 16 in South Australia, age 17 in Western Australia, and age 17 in Queensland). This puts the adult literacy rate at 99%. Australia's education system currently ranks eighth in the world[39]. There are a total of 38 state universities here. Besides, there are many private universities which are running on government subsidy. More than these, government technical colleges are running in these states. Education for various industries and professionals is provided here. 58% of Australians aged 25 to 65 have industrial or tertiary qualifications[33]. According to Health 2006 data, the average life expectancy of Australians is 78.7 years for men and 83.5 years for women[40]. Australia has the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world,[41] while tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of death and disease[42]. Australia has the highest prevalence of obesity among developed countries[43]; Meanwhile, Australia is one of the countries that has successfully prevented the spread of AIDS [44][45]. Australian Tamils ​​Tamils ​​began to migrate to Australia from the 1970s. Before that some people have come with work permit. Government estimates indicate that a total of 162 Tamils ​​immigrated to Australia before 1971[46]. The first Tamil to migrate to Australia was Kamal K. Kamaleswaran. The number of Tamil Australians increased from 202 in 1971 to 11,376 in 1991. 60 percent of them are Eelam Tamils. According to government census, the number of Tamils ​​increased to 18,690 in 1996 and 24,067 in 2001[47]. More than 50 percent of them live in the state of New South Wales. Rather than Sri Lanka, they migrated to Australia from countries like India, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, and Fiji in anticipation of opportunities. Culture From 1788, Australia's culture was essentially Anglo-Celtic. However, the natural environment, and the culture of the tribes defined some of Australia's unique cultures. Since the mid-20th century, Australian culture has been heavily influenced by American popular culture (especially television and film), Australia's neighboring Asian countries, and immigration from non-English-speaking countries. The history of Australian painting begins with Aboriginal cave paintings [48]. Australian Aboriginal heritage has been passed down mostly through oral tradition and rituals. Aboriginal music, dance and painting have greatly influenced contemporary Australian culture. Famous painters like Emily Kingwarei and Gordon Bennett belong to the tribe. The National Gallery of Australia and art galleries in many states have collections of local and foreign paintings. Media Australia operates two public television services (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Multicultural Special Broadcasting Service) and three private television services. There are also many private cable, and many non-profit television services. Each of the state capitals publishes separate newspapers. Two newspapers are published nationally. According to Reporters Without Borders' 2008 report, Australia's media freedom is ranked 25th. New Zealand is ranked 7th and the United States is ranked 48th. Such a low rating for Australia is thought to be due to the fact that most of the press in the country is dependent on two large commercial companies, News Corporation and Joan Fairbox[49]. Sport In Australia 23.5 per cent of over 15s engage in some form of team sport [33]. Australia is internationally renowned for sports such as rowing, hockey, netball, rugby league, and rowing and swimming. The 1956 and 2000 Olympic Games were held in Australia. Australia has been among the top six medal winners since 2000[50]. [51] The Australian Open Grand Slam tournaments are world famous in tennis. Biodiversity Although much of Australia is semi-arid or desert, its habitats range from montane to tropical rainforest. Due to factors such as extreme climatic changes and long periods of geographical isolation, Australia's biota is unique and diverse. 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, 45% of birds, and 89% of aquatic species such as fish are unique to Australia[52]. Kangaroo, koala, wallaroo are some of the Australian animals. Australia has the largest number of land animals in the world. There are about 755 species of reptiles[53]. Economy thumbnail|right|Australia's largest gold mine is located in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia The Australian dollar is the currency of Australia. In addition to Australia, it is also the official currency of Christmas Islands, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island, and the Pacific islands of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. Australia has a mixed economic system with Western countries. It was ranked third in the United Nations' 2007 Human Development Index and sixth in The Economist's 2005 World Standard of Living Index. The unemployment rate in Australia in 2007 was 4.6%. GDP is slightly higher than that of the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Also, in The Economist magazine's list of the world's most livable cities (2008), Melbourne was ranked 2nd, Perth 4th, Adelaide 7th, and Sydney 9th [54].

"The Earth's atmosphere is a layer of various gases that surrounds the Earth due to its gravity. It consists of four-fifths nitrogen, one-fifth oxygen and several other gases, including carbon dioxide in very small quantities. The atmosphere supports life on Earth by absorbing ultraviolet rays from solar radiation and by reducing temperature differences between day and night. The atmosphere does not have a clear boundary. The density of the atmosphere gradually decreases and disappears. There is no definite boundary between atmosphere and outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within 11 kilometers of the Earth's surface. In the United States, anyone who goes above 80.5 km is classified as an astronaut. It is also assumed that the atmospheric impact on return from space starts at 120 km altitude. A line called the Karman line at an altitude of 100 km is considered to be the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. Elements that make up Earth's atmosphere contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen. Apart from this, argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor and many other gases make up the Earth's atmosphere. Atmospheric forces Earth's atmosphere is divided into five zones. They are Troposphere Stratosphere mesosphere thermosphere exosphere The atmosphere Troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. 75 percent of the total mass of the atmosphere; 99% of water vapor and suspended dust particles are in the atmosphere. This layer contains the color that occurred after the heat cycle. The average thickness of the lower atmosphere at the equator is about 17 kilometers (10 miles). In tropical regions its thickness extends up to 20 kilometers (12 miles). Its thickness is less than 7 km (4 mi) in polar regions in summer, but less pronounced in summer. squadron Stratosphere is the second layer of Earth's atmosphere. It is found between the lower atmosphere and the mesenteric zone. It is in this that the ozone layer is found Middle zone The mesosphere is the third layer of the Earth's atmosphere. It lies between the Tropics and the Tropics. Warm atmosphere The thermosphere is the fourth layer of the Earth's atmosphere. It is located between the middle zone and the peripheral zone. outer zone The exosphere is the fifth layer of the Earth's atmosphere. Temperature and Atmospheric Layers Atmospheric temperature varies with height above the Earth's surface; The mathematical relationship between temperature and altitude also differs between different atmospheric layers: Troposphere: From 7 km to 17 km above the surface, temperature decreases with height depending on latitude and climatic factors. 90% of the gases in the ring are found Stratosphere: The temperature increases as the altitude increases up to 50 km above the stratosphere. The ozone layer is found in this region. Mesosphere: From 50 km to 80 - 85 km the temperature decreases with increasing altitude. Thermosphere: From 80 - 85 km to 640+ km the temperature increases with altitude. Radio waves scatter through this region and reach the Earth Seematis are mostly found in this region. exosphere The boundaries between these regions are called tropopause, stratopause and mesopause. The average temperature of the atmosphere at the Earth's surface is 14°C. Pressure Main article: Atmospheric pressure Atmospheric pressure is a direct result of the mass of the sphere. Because the magnitude and mass of the Earth's crust above the surface varies from place to place and time to time, gravity also varies with space and time. At an altitude of about 5 km the atmospheric pressure drops by ~50%. (In other words about 50% of the atmospheric mass is contained within the lower 5 km). The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 101.3 kilopascals (about 14.7 kilopascals per square inch). studies On May 9, 2013, National Ozone and Atmospheric Administration scientists at the Mauna Loa Observatory reported an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels of 400 parts per million.[1] Proverbs, by J.

"Electronic voting machine (Electronic voting machine) is a device used in some countries to register voter's vote during elections. A machine that stores the recorded information and displays the number of votes received by the candidate. Presently electronic voting machines are used in countries like India, Brazil and USA. History of Electronic Voting Machine in India Post-independence India, elections were conducted on the ballot system. Later, due to technological development, electronic voting machines came into use. The Election Commission planned to use electronic voting machines as a measure to implement electoral reforms using modern technology to reduce the problems associated with the use of ballot papers in Indian elections and wastage of time and money. Before introducing it, the opinion of the technical team consisting of Sampath, Indresan and Rao Kasar Patha was consulted. The Election Commission decided to use electronic voting machines only after the committee unanimously recommended it. Recognized political parties were also consulted. During the 1982 Parur by-election in Kerala, electronic voting machines were used in 50 polling booths as a trial run. In the 2004 general election, 10 lakh 75 thousand electronic voting machines were used across the country. Central government companies such as Bharat Electronics Corporation and Electronics Corporation of India are manufacturing these electronic voting machines and supplying them to the Election Commission. application With electronic voting machines, the cost of paper and printing is greatly reduced as a minimum number of ballots are required per polling booth. Paper usage was reduced by 8,800 tonnes for the 1996 general elections and 7,700 tonnes for the 1999 general elections. Method of use The machine consists of two parts, the control unit and the recording unit. The control device is located at the location of the third polling officer and the voting device is located at the secret place where the voter polls. These two devices are connected by a ten meter long cable. Once a voter presses a button for a candidate, it becomes a voter record for that candidate. Then the third polling officer presses the vote button on the control panel again, and the machine registers the next vote. When the machine key is registered, the date and time will be recorded. After the polling is complete, the machine will not accept any statistics if the close button is pressed. Pressing the Total button will display the number of votes recorded till then. This can be compared with the Voter Registration Book in Form 17-A. Special features If the machine malfunctions during registration, the Zonal Officer of the area will replace it with a new machine. Since the votes recorded in a broken machine remain in its 'memory', there is no need to run the vote from scratch. This machine will not record more than five shots per minute. If someone tries to capture the polling booth, the presiding officer can press the 'end' button and stop the polling. If elections are held for both Parliament and Assembly at the same time, separate machines will be used for both. If the 'result' section is not stamped, the results of a particular polling booth can be known before the vote is taken to the counting center on a particular day. Thus, the candidate or his representative will be asked to sign on the stamped strip or paper with the stamps of the Central Chairman. At the counting center, when the 'Result' button is pressed, the total number of votes recorded in that booth will be displayed on its screen, along with the number of votes received by each candidate. Apart from the counting center officers, representatives of the candidates will also note this. At the end of each round, the results of that round and the total sum will be announced. The round based results will be aggregated and the final result will be announced. Controversies Some political parties in India have requested the Election Commission to change this system. The Election Commission is refusing to accept it. It has announced that it is ready to correct the irregularities if it proves to be leading to them. No political party has proved that the voting machine can be tampered with. Use in other countries Presently electronic voting machines are used in countries like India, Brazil and USA. Some countries are reluctant to adopt this system on the grounds that the information recorded in it can be changed.

"The Nobel Prize or Nobel Prize (old case) is a highly regarded prize awarded worldwide to those who have carried out outstanding research, invented technologies or tools of great utility, and made exceptional contributions to society. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded only to certain organizations. As of March 2005, 770 Nobel Prizes have been awarded. However, some have refused to accept this gift. It was started in 1895 by chemist Alfred Nobel. The first prize was awarded in 1901. There were some years when even a prize was not announced. However, the award will be announced at least once in five years. The Nobel Prize is non-refundable. Alfred Nobel's bequests include physics, chemistry, literature, medicine or physiology, and peace. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was established in 1968 by the Swedish Central Bank to celebrate its 300th anniversary. Each laureate will receive a gold medal and a plaque, as well as prize money based on the Nobel Foundation's income for the year. History Alfred Nobel was born on October 21, 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden. His family was a family of engineers[1]. He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor during his lifetime. In 1894, Nobel bought the Bofors Iron and Steel Works and turned it into a large arms manufacturing plant. He invented the ballistic-arm, a British-made smokeless explosive, and a patent case was filed over it.Nobel made much of his fortune during his lifetime, chief among them dynamite. 2]. In 1888 he was shocked to see his obituary in a French newspaper, ""Death of the Merchant of Death"". But then it was Ludwig, Alfred's brother, who died. But the news left Nobel reeling, and he began to think seriously about how he would be remembered after his death. This led him to rewrite his will.[3] Alfred Nobel died at the age of 63 on December 10, 1895 at San Remo, Italy[4]. To everyone's surprise, Nobel's last will specified that the bulk of his estate be used to award prizes in the fields of physics, chemistry, peace, medicine and literature to those who had contributed to the 'advancement of the human race'[5]. Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. His last will and testament was written and signed by him at the Swedish-Norwegian Forum in Paris on 27 November 1895[6][7]. He bequeathed 94% of his estate, 31 million Swedish kroner (€150 million, US$186 in 2008 values), to five Nobel Prizes.[8] It was only approved by the Norwegian Parliament on April 26, 1897 due to doubts over his will[9]. The executors of Nobel's will, Ragnar Solmann and Rudolf Lieqvist, set up a ""Nobel Foundation"" to transfer his estate and regulate the distribution of prizes.[10] According to Nobel's notes, the Norwegian Nobel Committee was set up to award the Nobel Peace Prize, and its members were chosen within days of the will's approval. After that, committees were also formed to give other prizes. They are the Karolinska Institutet (June 7), the Swedish Society (June 9), and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (June 11).[11] The rules for how the prizes are to be awarded were promulgated in 1900 by King Oscar II, after being approved by the Nobel Foundation.[5] Norway and Sweden separated in 1905. Since then, the responsibility for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize rests with Norway and the responsibility for awarding the other prizes rests with organizations in Sweden.[9] Nobel Foundation The ""Nobel Foundation"" was established as a private corporation on June 29, 1900 to oversee the financial resources and administration of the Nobel Prizes.[12] According to Nobel's will, the foundation's primary duty is to protect the property left by Nobel. Brothers Robert and Ludwig Nobel invested heavily in oil companies in Azerbaijan. Swedish historian E. Barkengren, who personally visited the Nobel family history collections, says that the withdrawal of Nobel's investments from Baku was the initial catalyst for the prize.[13] Another task of the Nobel Foundation is to fund the prize globally and oversee the administration of the prize. The Foundation takes no part in selecting the awardees.[14][15] In many ways the foundation functions as an investment group, investing Nobel's assets to generate funds for the awarding and administration of the prize. Since 1946 the Nobel Foundation has been exempt from all taxes in Sweden. It has been exempt from all taxes in the United States since 1953.[16] Since the 1980s, its investments have been reaping huge returns. As of December 31, 2007, the Nobel Foundation's assets were 3.628 billion Swedish kroner (US$560 million).[17] According to the rules, the foundation will be headquartered in Stockholm. Also, five citizens of Sweden or Norway shall be members of the Foundation. The Chairman of the Trust is elected by the King's Advisory Council. The other four members are elected by the trustees of the organizations that elect Nobel laureates. Among the Trust's members are its Executive Director, one Deputy Director is elected by the King's Advisory Committee, and two Associate Directors are elected by the Foundation's Trustees. However, since 1995 all members are elected by the trustees of the Nobel Prize Organizations. The Director and Deputy Director are elected by the Trustees themselves. Apart from the foundation members, the Nobel Foundation includes all prize-giving bodies (Swedish National Academy of Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Swedish Academy, Norwegian Nobel Institute), their trustees and auditors.[17] First Prizes After the establishment of the Nobel Foundation and its regulations, the Nobel Societies prepared proposals for the first prizes to be awarded. Thereafter the selected lists were sent to the awarding bodies. Adding to the credibility of the prizes, the Norwegian Nobel Society appointed the distinguished Jørgen Løvland, Jørnstjern Jørnsson and Johannes Steen to the prize committee.[18] The Nobel Committee decided to award the prize to two prominent figures from the emerging peace movements of the late 19th century: Frédéric Bassi (co-founder of the League of Nations) and Henry Dunant (founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross).[19][20][21] The Nobel Prize in Physics was chosen by the Nobel Society for two people: William Röntgen, the discoverer of X-rays, and Philip Lennard, the discoverer of cathode rays. The Swedish Academy of Sciences chose Röntgen as its laureate.[19][20][21] By the end of the 19th century, many chemists had made important discoveries and advances. Therefore the awarding body was forced to prepare the merit list as per the award.[22] 20 proposals were placed in this sector. 11 of them were for Jacobus van Gaa.[23] Jacobus van Gaal was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize for his contributions to chemical-thermodynamics.[24][25] Sallie Prudhoem was chosen by the Swedish Society for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. 42 Swedish writers and poets protested against this and expressed their displeasure, believing that Leo Tolstoy would win and was the most deserving of the prize.[26] Some, including Burton Belduman, were of the opinion that Sallie Bruthome was an ordinary poet. Burton Belduman accused the awarding bodies of pretending to be Victorian literary enthusiasts and therefore giving the prize to a Victorian poet.[27] The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to the German physiologist and microbiologist Erich von Behring-Kuch. In the 1890s Erich von Behring discovered the vaccine for diphtheria, and until then thousands of people died from diphtheria every year.[28][29] World War II Adolf Hitler's Third Reich in 1938 and 1939 prevented three Nobel laureates (Richard Kuhn, Adolf Friedrich Johann Beutenant, and Jörghard Tomak) from receiving the prize.[30] However, each later received their diploma and prize.[31] Although Sweden played a neutral role during World War II, the Nobel Prizes were awarded at intervals. No one was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1939. During the period 1940-42, Norway was occupied by Germany and no prize was awarded in any sector. The following year, in addition to the Nobel Prizes for Peace and Literature, others were awarded.[32] Three Nobel Foundation members fled abroad after the capture of Norway. The other Foundation members there would have been under pressure from the Nazis because the Nobel Society had declared that the Nobel House in Oslo was Swedish property. The palace was therefore a refuge from the German army, as Sweden was not at war with Germany.[33] Although the Foundation members there continued to oversee the work of the Nobel Foundation, no prizes were awarded. In 1944 the Nobel Foundation announced that the proposals had been received, including the three members who had escaped abroad, and that the Nobel Peace Prize would continue to be awarded as usual.[30] Prize for Economic Sciences In 1968, the Swedish Central Bank, in celebration of its 300th anniversary, donated a large sum to the Nobel Foundation to establish a prize in Nobel's name. The following year, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded. The Swedish National Academy of Sciences is responsible for selecting the laureates. The first economics prize winners were Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Fritsch. They have ""created and successfully implemented operating models for economic activity,"" noted the Nobel Committee.[34][35] Although not a Nobel Prize, it is identified with other Nobel Prizes. Laureates are announced at the same time as other Nobel laureates are announced. The prize in economics is awarded at the Swedish Nobel Prize ceremony.[36] After the addition of this prize, the Nobel Foundation Committee met and decided not to award any new prizes.[37] Award System The award system is the same for all Nobel Prizes; The main difference is who recommends them individually.[38] Nominations Nomination forms are sent to about 3,000 individuals by the Nobel Committee, usually in September a year before the prizes are awarded. Inquiries for the Nobel Peace Prize are addressed to governments, members of the International Court of Justice, professors and college presidents, former Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of nomination forms is January 31 of the award year. The Nobel Prize Committee will nominate around 300 potential winners from these forms and additional names. The Selection Nobel Prize Committee then produces a report reflecting the advice of experts in relevant fields. This, along with a list of initial candidates, will be submitted to awarding agencies. It meets the selection of laureates in each category by a majority vote. A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected for each award. Apart from the Peace Prize, which can be given to organizations, awards can only be given to individuals. If the Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded, the money will be divided among scientific prizes. This has happened 19 times so far. Award Ceremony All Nobel Prizes, except the Nobel Peace Prize, are presented annually on Nobel's memorial day, December 10, in Stockholm, Sweden. The speech of the prize-winners is usually held on the eve of the event. On the same December 10th, the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony and Laureate Speech will be held in Oslo, Norway. Since Norway and Sweden were a single commonwealth at the time of Alfred Nobel's will, the Peace Prize is awarded in Norway and other prizes in Sweden. The event and the festivities surrounding it have recently become a global phenomenon. Nobel Prize and Tamils ​​Three Tamils ​​have won the Nobel Prize so far. These proud people W. Rama (1930), Subramanian Chandrasekhar (1983), Venkatraman Ramakrishnan (2009).

"The Amazon River (Sri Lankan case: Amazon River, commonly abbreviated Amazon (US: /ˈæməzɒn/ or UK: /ˈæməzən/; Spanish and Portuguese: Amazonas)) is a river in the South American continent. It is one of the two longest rivers in the world, the other being the Nile River. .The Amazon is the largest river in the world, and according to some authors, it is the largest river in the world with a length of 6400 km .Its total volume is greater than the volume of fresh water of the next eight major rivers. The course of this river has changed many times. Originally flowing towards the west, this river flows towards the east due to the growth of the Andes Mountains. The Amazon River is not crossed by a bridge anywhere. This is not because of its width, but because modern engineers can build a bridge across it. However, as most of the river flows through tropical rainforests and there are few cities there is no need for a bridge. Although the Amazon River is the largest in the world by various measures, it is only slightly shorter than the Nile in terms of length, according to most geographers. However, some scientists from Brazil and Peru refuse to accept this. The river discharges approximately 209,000 cubic meters per second—approximately 6,591 cubic kilometers per year, more than the next seven largest rivers combined—and the Amazon accounts for 20% of the world's river discharge.[1] The Amazon basin is the world's largest drainage basin, covering an area of ​​approximately 7,050,000 square kilometers (2,720,000 sq mi). Countries where the Amazon flows Although its tributaries originate in Peru and Ecuador, most of its riverbed is located in Brazil. Amazon has more than six thousand affiliates. Out of these 17 rivers have a length of more than 1000 km. Watershed The Amazon drainage basin is the largest in the world. It accounts for approximately 40 percent of the area of ​​South America. A catchment area of ​​this is found in the inner Andean highlands. The area is close to the Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River drains a lot of water into the Atlantic Ocean. During the rainy season the flow was up to 300,000 cubic meters per second and during the period 1973-1990 it was approximately 209,000 cubic meters. The Amazon basin is connected to the basin of the Orinoco, another major river in South America, by the Caziquier Canal. So it is called a natural water connection. Although the term canal refers to the Casiquiuer, it is a tributary of the upper Orino River. It runs south to join the Rio Negro, a tributary of the Amazon. ORIGIN The Amazon River is a large multi-tributary river system in Peru and Ecuador. Many flow directly into rivers such as the Maranon and Ugayali. Several rivers like the Marana, Pastaza, Nuguere, etc. flow into the main Amazon River. It was established in 2001-2007 that the Amazon is formed in the glacial lake of the snow-capped Navato Misimi peak in the Andean mountain range of Peru. It is west of Lake Titicaca and southeast of Lima. Water from the Navado Misimi flows into the Cupiradas Carcusanta and Apaceda Rivers, which join the Rio Apurimac, a tributary of the Ugayali River. The Ugayali joins the Marañon to form the main Amazon River. This location is considered by most geologists to be the origin of the primary Amazon. The river here is called Solimos dos Aguas in Brazil. After a thousand miles the dark colored Rio Negro joins the muddy Amazon. For six miles the two run in unbroken succession. Floods Not all Amazon tributaries flood at the same time. Most of them start flooding in November and last till June. The Rio Negro begins to flood in February or March and recedes by June. The Medirera floods and recedes two months before other Amazon tributaries. The average depth of the river during monsoon is 40 feet. The main river is approximately one to six miles wide. Larger ocean-going cells can reach as far as Manaus. Smaller 3000 ton or 9000 ton cells with the lower part of the cell up to 18 feet above the water level can travel up to 3600 km in the river. Estuary There is a difference of opinion among experts regarding the width of its estuary due to the geography of the estuary. The Para River is counted along with the Amazon. Sometimes the Para River is considered a separate tributary of the Tocantins River. The estuary of the Para River is larger. The Para and Amazon rivers are connected by various canals. Between these lies Marajó Island. Its area is as big as Switzerland. Wildlife One-third of the world's species live in the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon basin and rainforest cover more than 5.4 million square km (2.1 million sq mi). More than 3,000 species of fish have been found in the Amazon River. The Amazon River Dolphin lives in the Amazon and Orinoco River basins. It is the largest of the river dolphin species. It can grow up to 100 feet. Birnka is the most common type of fish found here. They live in groups. These can attack animals like cows and deer. Humans have also been attacked. However, some species of pirangas attack humans. The red-bellied branca is particularly virulent in humans. Anaconda snakes are found along the shores of the Amazon basin. It is one of the largest snake species. They mostly live in water. Only its nose is above the water level. Amazon rainforest Main article: Amazon rainforest The Amazon rainforest begins east of the Andes mountain range. It is the world's largest rainforest and ecologically important. It is capable of consuming a large amount of carbon-dioxide emitted in the world. Protecting these rainforests is a major issue these days. The very humid Amazon Basin is a bastion of these rainforests. In this region, the Amazon River and its hundreds of tributaries flow very slowly and then flow into the ocean. This biologically rich rainforest is home to 25 lakh species of insects, thousands of plant species and approximately two thousand birds and mammals. A fifth of the world's bird species live in these forests. The Amazon rainforest is located mostly in Brazil, making it the second largest forested area (4,776,980 sq km) after Russia.

"Socrates (470/469 BC – 399 BC, February 15) [1] was a philosopher from Athens. No clear evidence is available as to when he was born. He is considered one of the most important icons of the Western philosophical tradition. His disciple Plato [2] was also a famous philosopher. Socrates is hailed as the Greek philosopher and the world's first philosopher. He asked the religious people, ""Who is God?"" His best is that Socrates was the first rationalist to ask the question. Socrates is famous for his contribution to the field of ethics as depicted through Plato's dialogues. Philosopher Socrates is known for his philosophical ideas of Socratic Irony and Socratic Method. The latter concept is commonly used as a tool in broad discussion, which is also a form of pedagogy, in which questions are asked not only to elicit individual responses to a series of questions, but also to encourage basic insight. Plato's Socrates contributed important and stable theories related to the theory of light. And his ideology and approach provided a strong foundation for subsequent Western philosophy. Socrates Riddle No works by Socrates were found. Thus information about him and his philosophies rests on secondary sources. Moreover, a close comparison between the contents of these sources exposes some inconsistencies, thus raising concerns about the possibility of knowing deeper truths about the real Socrates. This doubt is known as Socrates' conundrum [3] or Socrates' question [4][5]. One who wants to understand Socrates and his thoughts must first read Plato's works. These are important sources for the life and philosophy of Socrates[6] as are the works of Xenophon[7]. Among these are reports of frank dialogues involving Socrates[8][9]. Apart from the Xenophon, the ancient sources available for discovering facts about Socrates' life are mostly philosophical and dramatic texts. There is no direct contemporary history of Socrates. Two factors emerge from all sources relating to Socrates among all the opinions that have resulted in differences in available sources. While he may have been ugly, Socrates seems to have had a brilliant intellect [10][11]. Birth and Early Life of Socrates No evidence is available as to when Socrates was born. 2450 years ago i.e. BC. Socrates lived in the fifth century. He was born in the Greek city of Athens. His father was a sculptor. His mother is a midwife. At that time when no religion appeared in the world, he became proficient in the origin of human knowledge and logic through his own efforts. Socrates is hailed as the Greek philosopher and the world's first philosopher. Questioning Skills Socrates had a habit of asking questions as a boy. Socrates' habit was to ask questions about anything and find out the truth about it. Socrates examined everything like justice, reason, soul, God, society, government and custom. Socrates spent a great deal of time meeting people in public and conversing with them. But when others ask Socrates a question, Socrates does not directly answer it. Socrates would ask people question after question, focusing on a particular problem, asking them to answer, and asking the people who raised the problem to understand the reason. Socrates, who through his questioning made us realize the cause of the problem, also asked questions to solve the problem. The public was enlightened by such actions; They understood the problem. They also knew the reason. They also realized what needs to be done to overcome it. As a result, the Athenians believed that Socrates would provide clarity to all their problems. Socrates' writings and speeches made people think; It also motivates them to take action This questioning style of Socrates' student Socrates impressed the youth of Athens. Among the youth, Socrates was always present. Socrates' lodgings were always surrounded by a crowd of young people. His habit of asking questions was also transmitted to the young people. Not only did Socrates think about all the superstitions that had been practiced in Greek society for ages, but the young people also started to change. Similarly, Plato was inspired by Socrates' principles and joined Socrates. Later in the day, he also became a world famous philosopher. The government of Athens found out that the blame on Socrates began to change the youth. When Socrates was surrounded by a crowd of young people, it irritated some people. Socrates talked to the youth every day, which angered the Greek rulers. There were serious allegations against him. Socrates was sued by the politician Anytus, the artist Melitus, and the orator Lycon. This was due to their hatred of Socrates. Anidas, Lycaon, and Melitus accused Socrates of inciting the youth, inciting religious opposition, of engaging the youth in wrong ways for his own glory, and thereby endangering the Athenian government. The case came to trial in court after countless allegations of capital punishment. Then Melidus accused Socrates. He corrupts the youth, blasphemes the gods the Greeks worshiped, creates a new god of his own, explores the heavens and the earth (because the Greeks at that time worshiped nature as their god). He says that the moon is soil and the sun is stone. Introduces new religious doctrines. Socrates is very evil. He said that he should be sentenced to death. Socrates replied, 'I don't want to put my opponents in court and cross-examine them. My just enemies are injustice and ignorance. I refuse to acknowledge that I am lord of stone and earth. If researching about God and His creation is atheism, fearing where they will refuse to acknowledge God is more atheism than that. After this came the moment of judgment in the court. Two boxes were kept, Death and Forgiveness. 501 members of the Judiciary begin voting. 220 voted to pardon Socrates and 281 voted to sentence him to death. The judges declared Socrates guilty and ordered Socrates to declare what punishment he should be given. that he has not committed any crime; Socrates argued that his mother had done good for the country by her actions, and for that the court should have awarded her praise and reward instead of punishment. But if this Court decides to impose a penalty, it should be a fine; Socrates declared in court that his friends were ready to pay the fine to the government. The judges expected Socrates to apologize for his actions. But instead his arguments in court irritated the judges. So that Socrates should be poisoned and killed in BC. The judges ordered on 15th February 339. The court ruled that the sentence would be executed after 30 days due to some cause of death, and until then, Socrates' legs should be chained. Then the day of execution came. Socrates, who bought the poison cup, said, ""What should I do next?"" said. He said, “You must drink the poison in the cup. You should be walking around the prison after drinking. ""You should lie down when your legs are weak,"" said the jailer. Socrates finished drinking a cup of poison with a smile on his face. Seeing it, all the friends burst into tears. ""Why do you shed tears like women?"" Socrates asked with a smile and started walking. After walking for a while, he lay down on the ground. The poisoner squeezed Socrates' legs and said, ""Do you see me squeezing your legs?"" He said. ""No"" said Socrates. After a while his eyes closed. Socrates' method His method of philosophical inquiry, known as the Socratic method or the elenchos method, is his most important contribution to Western thought. He often used this method to test (examine) important points of virtue. For this, Socrates is regarded as the father and fountainhead of Virtue or Virtue Philosophy and thus of general philosophy.

"Latin America (Latin America, Spanish: América Latina or Latinoamérica, Portuguese: América Latina, French: Amérique latine, Italian: Latijns-Amerika) refers to the regions of the Americas where Romance languages ​​are prevalent. Spanish, Portuguese and French are widely spoken here[3][4]. Its total area is approximately 21,069,500 square kilometers. It accounts for 3.9 percent of the total Earth's surface area and 14.1 percent of the land area. It has a population of 59 crore as of 2013[5]. And its gross domestic product is 7368 billion[6]. Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela are part of Latin America. History Early history of colonialism The oldest signs of human habitation in Latin America are found in southern Chile. These are around 14000 years old. The first settlement after this was the Las Vegas culture[7]. It occurred in Ecuador between 8000 and 4600 years ago. Subsequently, tribal settlements were established in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. Later, many civilization groups emerged in the American regions of the land. Among them were the Aztecs, Taltecs, Caribs, Tubi, Maya and Inca groups. The Aztecs were especially dominant in Latin American regions. Their rule ended with the arrival of the Spanish in America. European colonization Since Columbus reached the Americas in 1492, European colonial domination of Latin America began. A Spanish force led by Hernán Gutés besieged and destroyed Aztec cities in North America. Similarly, an army led by Francisco Pizarro conquered and destroyed the Inca Empire in South America. This brought North and South West America under the control of the Spanish Empire. In the creation of further settlements, the border line between the two colonies was determined in 1494, following a dispute between Spain and Portugal. With this, the northern and western coasts of Latin America were brought under the Spanish Empire and the eastern coast under Portugal. Following them, Britain, France, and Holland, which were to be replaced, invaded America and established their colonies there. By the end of the sixteenth century, all of the Americas from Alaska to Chile had been converted into European colonies. Destruction of tribes Native American culture was crushed by successive colonizations and European culture spread. Roman Catholicism is the undeclared state religion. The Catholic Church was very powerful in terms of administrative and economic power. Through this, the religious rights of the American tribes were denied and they were forced to convert to Christianity. And large numbers of tribes died from plagues such as smallpox and measles brought by Europeans. The details of the number of such deaths are not available today. However, it is believed that 25% to 85% of the total tribal population may have died. The rest of the tribes were forced to work in the mines of the colonialists. Through the interbreeding that took place during this period, a new European-American mixed breed called the Mesutoso began to emerge. The Mezudos were the majority in Latin America in the late nineteenth century, when colonialism ended. Liberation struggle Following a slave revolt led by Toussaint Louverseur in Haiti in 1804, the country gained independence from France. Subsequently, slavery was abolished in that country and independence was established. This was the impetus for liberation struggles in other Latin American countries. Towards the end of the eighteenth century revolts against Spanish rule began to appear. Hispanics born in the mother country were categorized as upper caste, while Hispanics born in Latin America were classified as criollo or lower caste. This was the impetus for the liberation war there. Miguel Cosudilla, Simón Bolívar, and José San Martín rallied people in Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina respectively to fight for independence. Although the popular uprising was initially suppressed by the government troops, the popular struggle was further strengthened by the younger generation of generals such as Simón Bolívar and Jose San Martín. As a result of successive uprisings, by 1825 all Spanish colonial territories except Puerto Rico and Cuba had become independent. In 1822 a constitutional monarchy was established in independent Brazil. In the same year, the monarchy was established under the leadership of Augustin the Dubite, the military commander of Mexico. However, it was soon dissolved and the Republic of Mexico was born in 1823. Lineage of people Ethnic groups Latin America is a region with many ethnic origins. The distribution of these species varies from country to country. Native Americans, Asians, Africans, Mezudos (European-Native American mixed race), Mulattos (European-African mixed race), Europeans (especially Spanish and Portuguese), and Sambos (Native American-African mixed race) are most common in Latin America. . Language Spanish and Portuguese are both the most spoken languages ​​in Latin America. 60% of the total population speaks Spanish, 34% Portuguese, and 6% other languages ​​such as Quechua, Mayan, Guaraní, Aymara, Nagavalo, English, Italian, French, and Italian. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil. Spanish is the official language in all other Latin American countries except it. Spoken in French, Haiti and Guyana. Native American languages ​​are most widely spoken in Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Mexico. It is also spoken in significant numbers in Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Chile, and much less widely in other countries. Compared to other countries, Mexico has a large number of indigenous language speakers. Uruguay is the only Latin American country without an indigenous language case. religion Christianity is the majority religion in Latin America[8]. 70% of them are Roman Catholics. In Brazil, Panama and Venezuela, the Reformed Church has a steady growth. Apart from this, the tribal faith, Judaism, Islam etc. are practiced by a small number of people. Culture Latin American culture is a cultural blend of Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans. There is a lot of indigenous ways of culture and lifestyle and European influence in religion, art, painting etc. Music and dance are synonymous with African culture.

"An elephant is a herbivorous (leaf-eating) mammal. It is the largest of all land animals. It is also very long-lived (~70 years). It is the longest living land animal besides humans. Elephants are very strong. The beasts of prey and the highest in the food hierarchy of wild animals, the lion (Arima), the tiger, etc., are unapproachable in strength. Lions gang up and kill a tired or young elephant that might come alone. However, such incidents are very rare. Elephants live in families. Also, they have high memory capacity. Only three elephants remain in the world today. They are African bush elephants, African forest elephants and Asian elephants. There are significant differences between them. Generally, all elephants live up to about 70 years. A male elephant is called Kaliru. A female elephant is called Bd. A baby elephant is called a calf or cub. The sound made by an elephant is called bellowing. Elephant Species African elephants are larger in stature than Asian elephants. They have large ear lobes. Both male and female African elephants have tusks. However, ivory is rarely found in Asian female elephants. The back of African elephants curves slightly inwards behind the head and is flat without raised forehead ridges. These have two petals at the apex of the thallus. But the front feet have four or five claws and the hind feet have three claws. Asian elephants have slightly raised backs. There are two ridges on the forehead and small ear lobes. There is only one petal at the apex of the thallus (upper margin). The front feet have five claws and the hind feet have four claws. Food and Habitat Elephants are herbivores or herbivores. They like to eat bamboo and sugarcane. They spend 16 hours a day gathering food. Also, their digestive capacity is very slow. Therefore, 40 percent of these foods are digested. Hence, they tend to consume a lot of food. Well-grown elephants consume about 140 to 270 kg of food per day. Physique Male elephants are typically 3 meters tall and weigh 6000 kilograms. Elephant skin is very thick. There will be a thickness of about 3 cm. However, it will be slow. Thus, mosquitoes etc. will also bite. An elephant has four strong legs. Despite its bulky body, the elephant can climb and descend hills and steep places efficiently. The proverb ""the foot of an elephant glides"" is a reference to the elephant's ability to walk in long ups and downs. Trunk The special feature of an elephant is its trunk. It is best seen only in elephants. Although a few animals have a slightly elongated frontal nose (like the proboscis monkey), there are no animals with long trunk-like limbs. The trunk is made up of a total of 40,000 muscles. It is flexible in all directions. At the tip of the trunk are the nostrils through which the elephant breathes, and tiny, highly sensitive fingertips.[1] The trunk can lift anything from a small stick to a large tree. They usually help in picking up food and drinking water. The elephant repels attacks from hostile animals with its trunk. Because the neck is short the prominence of the trunk is great. Tusk Elephants have two tusks. These are called elephant lines. This elephant coat is present only in male elephants (Kalurukku) in Asiatic Indian elephants and not in female elephants (Pitukku). But African wild elephants, both male and female, have a stripe (both male and female). The elephants living in Sumatra and Borneo, the elephants of Sri Lanka, are bisexual (Kaliru, Pd) and often have an elephant line. An elephant's tusk is an extension of an elephant's molars. Hence these are also called elephant's tusks or tusks (tusks and tusks mean teeth). Tusks can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet). And they can weigh up to 90 kilograms. These tusks are also used for trade. In March 2015, Ethiopia burned six tons of ivory taken from several elephants.[2] Leather Elephant skin is very thick. Thick skin is found in most parts of the body. The skin is about two and a half centimeters thick. However, the skin around its mouth and inside the ear is thin. Asian elephants generally have more hair on their skin than African elephants. Elephants usually smear mud or dirt all over their bodies. This is an important characteristic of elephant society. It helps to protect the skin of the elephant from the sun's heat and radiation. Although the elephant's skin is thick, it is very sensitive. This is why elephants spit mud or dirt after bathing. Legs They have strong legs to support the elephant's large body. They don't need much muscle power to stand because of their straight legs and wide feet. So they can stand for a long time without resting. African elephants often do not sit unless they are sick or injured. But Asian elephants rest often. The elephant has got a broad round foot (foot). The African elephant has three tusks (claws) on its hind legs and four on its front legs. The Asian elephant has four tusks on the hind legs and five on the front legs. Elephants can swim and climb well. These cannot be jumped. Ears Elephants have very large broad lobed ears. They play an important role in maintaining the elephant's body temperature. Elephant's ears are full of blood vessels. The ambient air cools down as the heated blood flows into the ears. Then it goes into the body and lowers the temperature. Due to blood circulation, this process is continuous and the temperature is kept under control. This is why elephants are always seen moving their ears. The upper margin of a grown elephant's ear is folded outward in the Asian elephant, and curled inward in the African elephant.[3] Cognition The elephant's brain is the largest of all land animals. It weighs a little over five kilograms. Elephants have good memory. After elephants and dolphins, elephants are considered to be the most intelligent animals. Elephants are said to be second to humans in intelligence. Elephant brains are also superior in structure and technique. They also learn to use tools. Elephants are generally compassionate.[4] Sensory Sense Elephants have excellent hearing and sense of smell. The elephant's eye is slightly myopic. Thus, an elephant relies on its keen sense of hearing and subtle sense of smell rather than its sight.[5] Their trunks are also sensitive. Not only their ears but also their trunks are capable of sensing vibrations. Their feet are capable of sensing very low frequency sound waves. Social Life The social life of greens is different from the life of pits. Embryos live with their mother's group until they reach puberty, then mostly alone. But the Bds live as a well-knit family of mother, sister and daughter. Adolescence is also observed during the breeding season. Self-awareness Elephants are self-aware. It is established by glass testing. Elephants recognize themselves when placed in front of a mirror. This ability has so far only been found in baboons, some monkeys, and dolphins. A study conducted among domesticated elephants in Zimbabwe suggests that elephants have the ability to understand a person's pointing.[6] A breeding elephant has a gestation period of 22 months. This is the longest gestation period in mammals. They usually give birth to only one calf. Twins are very rare. A newborn baby elephant weighs between 90 – 115 kilograms. Before, during, and after calving, the elephant is greatly assisted by the presence of other adult elephants. From birth, the calf is raised by the herd. Threats Poaching A major threat to elephants is poaching. Elephants are hunted for their tusks. Large, long-lived and slow-breeding elephants, over-hunting has a major impact. They are large and cannot be hidden easily. Each elephant takes years to grow and breed. Each elephant needs an average of 140 kilograms (300 pounds) of leaves per day. Due to the destruction of large animals like tigers and lions, small herbivores competing for elephants' food are multiplying and destroying plants, making it difficult for elephants to get food. Elephants are rarely killed for food by animals other than humans. Habitat Shrinkage Another important threat is the destruction of elephant habitats. Humans are destroying elephant habitats for agricultural expansion. This creates conflicts between the interests of humans and the interests of elephants. For example, elephants enter new agricultural settlements, destroying crops and endangering lives of people. An average of 150 elephants and 100 humans die in Sri Lanka every year due to such conflicts. Deforestation also reduces the habitat of elephants. Habitat loss is said to be the primary reason for the extinction of Asian elephants. Elephants require large areas of forest to survive. Because elephants enter an area in droves and destroy trees and plant vines. Then they go somewhere else. Thus the destroyed forests go to new places and re-grow and come back to the same place and get food. As habitats shrink, food runs out very quickly.[7] Humans and Elephants As elephants are killed legally and against the law by humans, there are unintended consequences for elephants' physiology. Ivory poachers in Africa hunt elephants with large tusks, leaving the remaining elephants with small tusks or no tusks. Newly born cubs are also more likely to be born with these, leading to the addition of tuskless genes in new generations, leading to the birth of large numbers of tuskless elephants. The number of such elephants has increased from 1% in 1930 to 30% in some areas. Edentulism was once a rare genetic mutation and is now becoming a common hereditary trait. Mortality Elephants can die of heart failure, heart attack, and cerebral hemorrhage.[8] Elephant in Sangam Literature In Tamil Sangam literature, the elephant is mentioned in more than 170 names.

"In physics, the density of a substance refers to how much mass or density the substance has in a given volume. For example, one cubic centimeter of gold has a mass of 19.32 grams. But the same density of silver per cubic centimeter is only 10.49 grams. So the ""density"" of gold is greater than the density of silver. The density is given by the following equation. r = m V {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}} SI Units: ρ = (Rho or Rho) the density of the material (unit: kg/m-3, kg·m-3} m = mass or mass of object (unit: kg, kg) V = volume (volume) of the object (unit: m3) Density is how many grams per centimeter while mass or density is in grams and density is in units of cubic centimeters (cubic hundredths of a meter).

This symbol is derived from the Latin name for silver, Argentum. Its atomic number is 47, And it has 60 atoms in its nucleus and its atomic mass is 107.86 amu. History Silver has been used for thousands of years. It was generally considered to be the second most valuable layer after gold. Silver was used as money by the Romans, and silver was used to prevent disease and decay. Isotopes Naturally occurring silver has two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, 109Ag. The 107Ag isotope is slightly more abundant in nature. Rarely are there more naturally occurring isotopes on the periodic table than this. Its atomic weight is 107.8682(2) atomic mass units[1][2]. This quantity becomes very important in silver compounds. This quantity is considered important especially in unweighted analysis of alides. Both isotopes are produced by the Esu-process in galaxies and the R-process in ultraluminous galaxies[3]. A total of 28 radioactive isotopes have been described for silver. Of these, the 105Ag isotope is the most stable with a half-life of 41.29 days. 111Ag isotope has a half-life of 7.45 days and 112Ag 3.13 hours. Furthermore, the element silver has acquired numerous nuclear modifiers. Of these, 108mAg has a half-life of 418 years, 110mAg has a half-life of 249.79 days, and 106mAg has a half-life of 8.28 days. All other radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than an hour. Most of these have half-lives of less than 3 minutes [4]. Silver isotopes range from relative atomic mass 92.950 93Ag to atomic mass 129.950 130Ag. Those before the more stable 107Ag isotope are formed primarily by electron capture decay and those after it by beta decay [5]. The first decay products of the 107Ag isotope thus formed are palladium (element 46) and the second decay products are cadmium (element 48) isotopes. The palladium isotope 107 Pd is formed by beta decay of the isotope 107Ag. Its half-life is 6.5 million years. These palladium-silver isotope ratios are found in sufficient quantities only in iron meteorites. Radioactive decay of 107Ag was detected in the Santa Clara meteorite in 1978[6]. Properties Physical Properties Silver is a soft metal and is a valuable metal used as money or jewelry It is often mixed with gold or some other metal to harden them. It has a very shiny bluish white color It is an excellent conductor of electricity. Silver, the English name for silver, is one of the only words taken from the English language.It is so valuable that silver coins and bars are bought and sold in shops around the world. This metal is a very malleable metal. It is a well-known, malleable, and malleable metal as many have seen vessels made of silver such as mugs, plates, and bowls. Chemical Properties It is a very reactive metal It is not highly soluble in acids, although nitric acid dissolves it to form silver nitrate. It does not react with potassium dichromate or strong oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate. It does not corrode easily. It reacts only in the presence of hydrogen sulphide with air to form a black film called silver oxide. +1 and +2 Compounds of Silver: Compounds of silver are predominantly +1. A few compounds are in the +2 state but these are highly toxic and are very strong oxidizing agents. Silver compounds can be brownish black, yellow, gray, or colorless. Silver compounds are usually disinfectants. Silver (|) compounds Silver (|) compounds are excellent oxidizing agents. They are very expensive. They Pale yellow silver bromide, yellow silver carbonate, yellow White silver chloride, yellowish brown silver (|) fluoride, Colorless silver iodide, yellow silver iodide, colorless silver nitrate, brown or black silver oxide, black silver sulphide, Silver (||) Compounds Silver (||) compounds are also powerful oxidizing agents and are rare. Silver (||) fluoride is a white or gray very strong oxidizing agent. The element silver combines with elements like copper, gold, and zinc to form metallic alloys. Occurrence and Extraction Silver is found on Earth's surface at 0.08 parts per million. It is almost the same size as mercury. Silver is mostly found in sulphide ores. Acantite and archendite are important silver minerals. Silver occurs naturally as an alloy with gold and as an alloy with arsenic, sulphur, antimony or chlorine. Ores of silver include arsentite, chlorargyrite and pyrarchyrite. Uses as an Element Uses Silver is used by thousands of people around the world as money, jewelry and many other things. It is called a white metal even though it appears gray in color. It is used to make silverware. It is used as an alloy to make artificial teeth and to fill gaps in teeth.Also silver is used as a reaction catalyst. Its Uses as Compounds Silver compounds are many disinfectants. It is used to kill bacteria and have some other uses. It is used as silver oxide in electrical storage batteries.They are used in photographic fibers. They are used to reduce odor in clothing. Some silver compounds are used in creams that help heal burns. Alone and as a by-product, it occurs in nature alone and from the minerals arsentite and chlorargyrite. Silver is the most electrical and thermally conductive element of all (elemental rain). Silver is a by-product of the extraction of elements such as copper, gold, lead, and zinc from minerals. Silver does not pose a major hazard to humans, although silver compounds are toxic, causing the victim's skin to turn blue. Silver reserves and extraction in the world Silver is actually more useful than gold. And every year since 1990, more has been used than mined, so the world's silver reserves are rapidly decreasing each year. Companies that use it get artificially low prices from companies that sell silver. This is called implicit underselling. Once all the world's silver reserves are depleted, the price of silver will skyrocket as investors start asking for their share of silver again. Silver prices were up to US$18 per ounce in June 2010. The price of silver increased to USD 28 per ounce in December 2010. 99.9% pure elemental silver is commercially available. In 2014, Mexico was the world's largest producer of silver, producing 5,000 tons of silver. It was followed by China with 4060 tonnes and Peru with 3780 tonnes [7].

"Isaac Newton (December 25, 1642 – March 20, 1727)[5] was an English mathematician, scientist, and philosopher. Newton did a lot of research in the fields of science, mathematics, mechanics and gravity. He was one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the Scientific Revolution. In 1687 he published Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which included explanations of gravity. Through his laws of motion, he spawned the field of classical mechanics. Along with Wilhelm Leibniz, Gottfried contributed to the development of the field of differential calculus. It was in Newton's Principia that the laws of motion, general gravitation, that dominated the cosmologist's view of physics for the next three centuries were formulated. It explained that the motions of objects on Earth and the motions of objects in space such as planets can be explained on the basis of the same principles. Newton built the first practical telescope and developed a theory of color based on the observation that a triple-glass splits white light into a spectrum of many colored lights. He also studied the speed of sound. Apart from his studies in micromathematics, as a mathematician he also contributed to studies of exponential series. Young Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day (December-25) 1642 in Woolsthorpe, near Colsterworth, Lincolnshire, England, to an average farming family. His father died three months before his birth. After two years, the mother moved in with her new husband, leaving Newton in the care of his grandmother. Education Newton attended Grantham Grammar School. Initially he did not concentrate well in his studies. But once he made fun of a boy older than him who made fun of him, he gained confidence and started studying well. Newton had an interest in science from an early age, and at an early age he built a clock that worked in water. He was forced to drop out of school when he was fourteen due to family poverty. In 1661, his uncle, aware of Newton's desire for education, admitted him to the prestigious Trinity College, Cambridge. The teaching of the college at that time was based on Aristotle. But he also wanted to learn the concepts of modern philosophers of the time like Newton, Descartes, Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler. In 1665, he discovered the Binomial Theorem and began to develop a new mathematical theory, later known as micromathematics. After he graduated in 1665, the university was closed due to the Great Plague. He spent the next two years at home studying micromathematics, optics, and gravity. Newton graduated with honors in 1665. There are not so many references to his university days. But within two years of his graduation, his scientific brain began to function at an exponential rate. He invented various elements of modern mathematics. Generalized binomial theorem, infinitesimal calculus and other sections of modern mathematics were invented by him. He devised methods for finding the area of ​​curved objects and the volume of solid objects. Career In 1667, at the age of 25, Newton was appointed professor of physics at Trinity College. He was awarded an honorary degree at Trinity College. He spent the next few years full-time in various researches. He studied the nature of light and focused on developing telescopes. In one year he also built a telescope. Through it he could see the moons of Jupiter Gol. Today's modern telescopes are based on Newton's first telescope. In 1669, Newton became professor of accounting at Trinity College. He was subsequently inducted into the prestigious Royal Society. Inventions He was the first to explain the laws of nature that govern geospatial and space motions. He was associated with the Scientific Revolution and the development of the heliocentric theory. Newton was also instrumental in providing the mathematical foundations for Kepler's laws of planetary motion. He expanded the above rules by arguing that the orbits of comets like comets could be not only elliptical but also parabolic and hyperparabolic. He discovered the effects of light falling on a triangle called a prism. He explained in the method that when the light ray of Katiravan passes through a prism, it splits into seven colors. He also demonstrated that Newton's disc, which had many colors, turned white when rotated. Geshopan was the first to explain that white light is a combination of many colored lights. He closed one eye and looked at the sun with the other eye to research colors. Suddenly the colors started changing. But Newton suffered damage to that eye. Because of that he had to spend days in the dark removing spots that floated in front of his eyes. The emission theory of light was formulated by Newton. The theory is that what we see as light is particles emitted from a distant luminous object rushing through space at a speed of one hundred and nine hundred thousand miles per second. He is also noted for arguing that light is made of cloth. See: wave-cloth duality He postulated that the force of attraction between two cloths is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Discovery of the Law of Gravitation Newton was under an apple tree when an apple fell on his head, which sparked his thinking and led to the idea of ​​gravity in space. This is thought to be an exaggeration of his own story of observing an apple fall from a tree from the porch of Woolsthorpe Manor. Newton's story is also believed to have been made up by him at a later date. In 1667, he published his findings in De Analysi per Aequationes Numeri Terminorum Infinitas (De Analysi per Aequationes Numeri Terminorum Infinitas) and later De methodis serierum et fluxionum (Methods of Series and Fluxions). Newton and Leibniz developed separate mathematical theories and used different symbols. Although Newton had developed his methods before Leibniz, the latter's symbols and ""classification method"" were considered advanced and generally accepted. Although Newton was one of the most accomplished scientists of his time, his last 25 years were marred by problems with Leibniz. He accused Leibniz of stealing his discoveries. , persistence were the pillars and he continued his researches with confidence whenever his theories were fiercely opposed. In 1669, he was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. His position exempted him from the obligation to attend church to remain a fellow of the college, and avoided conflict with the orthodox church due to his anti-Christian views. Theories of Force All objects are attracted to each other; That gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. For every reaction, there is an equal reaction from the opposite direction. To move a stationary object, an external force is essential. Recognizing that Newton's books contained a wealth of knowledge, his friend Hayley encouraged Newton to publish them. As a result, the book ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" was published in 1687. Also known as ""Principia"", the book is considered to be the best scientific book ever published. For two years from 1692 to 1694, Newton was seriously ill. He had nervous problems and insomnia. Rumors spread that Newton had lost his mind. But later recovered well and engaged in university work. Texts Method of Fluxions (1671) Opticks (1704) Arithmetica Universalis (1707) Distinctions In 1703 Newton was elected President of the Royal Society. It is noteworthy that he was elected president every year for the next 25 years. In 1705, the Queen of England (Queen Anne) honored Newton with the title of 'Sir' when he visited the University of Cambridge. Isaac Newton says the following about his achievement despite his great achievement in the field of physics. Whatever I am to this world, I am a boy playing on the beach, I see the soft pebble and the beautiful conch, but the vast ocean is not before my eyes."" ""Sir Isaac Newton"", who is still considered to be the best scientist in England, fell ill and died of natural causes on March 20, 1727. He was buried in the famous ""Westminster Abbey"" in London. The best and priceless gem of mankind is inscribed on his tombstone. While many have paid tribute to Newton, Pope's is the most profound.

"Egypt is a republic in North Africa. Cairo is the capital of the country. It is the 15th most populous country in the world. Bordered by Libya to the west, Sudan to the south, and the Kazakh coast and Israel to the east, Egypt covers an area of ​​approximately 1,001,450 square km. Egypt is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea on the northern shore and the Red Sea on the eastern shore. Egypt's Sinai Peninsula is located in Southwest Asia, making it a bi-continental country. The Nile River flows as the river of life in Egypt. Most of the land is desert except for agricultural land along the banks of the Nile. Egypt is one of the most populous countries in Africa and the Middle East. Most of the country's 82.2 million[2] people live on the 40,000 square kilometers (15,000 sq mi) of land along the Nile. These areas are rich in agricultural land and include major cities such as Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor. Fewer people live in the vast Sahara desert regions. About half of Egypt's population lives in urban areas. Independence was granted to the country in 1922 and declared in 1953. The world famous pyramids were built thousands of years ago by the ancient kings of Egypt. Monuments in Egypt such as the Giza Pyramid Complex and the Great Isufingsu date back to the Ancient Egyptian Civilization. Ancient ruins at Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings outside Luxor have attracted much attention from archaeologists. Egypt's economy is one of the most diversified in the Middle East. In this country, tourism, agriculture, industry and service sector have almost the same level of production. History Prehistoric Period There is evidence of prehistoric rock carvings in areas along the Nile and in desert oases. Hunter-gatherer and fisher cultures emerged in the 10th millennium BC. Due to climate change or overgrazing, or both, grasslands began to turn into deserts around 8000 BC, forming the Sahara Desert. Early ethnic groups migrated along the banks of the Nile and developed a stable agricultural economy and centralized society.[3] Around 6000 BC, Neolithic civilization emerged along the banks of the Nile.[4] During the Neolithic period, several predynastic cultures developed separately in Upper and Lower Egypt. The Baterian culture and the successive Naqqadab cultures are considered precursors to dynastic Egypt. Merimda, the oldest site in Lower Egypt, predates the Bactrian culture by 700 years. It appears that the people of the contemporaneous Lower Egyptian cultures coexisted with their southern Egyptian neighbors for more than two thousand years. They had distinct cultures and were connected through trade. The earliest Egyptian hieroglyphs are found on pre-dynastic Third Nakadak pottery dating to around 3200 BC.[5] Ancient Egypt In 3150 BC, King Menesu united Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt to form the unified Kingdom of Egypt. This was followed by a succession of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. Egyptian culture flourished in this area for a long time and remained a distinctly Egyptian culture in terms of religion, arts, language, and customs. The first two dynastic reigns of unified Egypt laid the foundations for the Old Kingdom period, from 2700 to 2200 BC. During this period, many pyramids were built, including the Djoser Pyramid of the Third Dynasty and the Giza Pyramids of the Fourth Dynasty. The First Middle Ages is a period of political upheaval spanning 15 years. The influx of water from the Nile and the determination of the government brought new prosperity to the Middle Kingdom and the country. It reached a high point during the Third Kingdom around 2040 BC. The Second Disunity brought Egypt under the rule of the outsider Semitic Ixoses. In 1650 BC, the Ixosians conquered most of Lower Egypt and established a new capital at Avaris. Achumose I invaded from Upper Egypt and established the Eighteenth Dynasty. He moved the capital from Memphis to Thebes. The New Kingdom period from 1550 to 1070 BC begins with the reign of the Eighteenth Dynasty. During this period Egypt grew into a multinational power. It was an empire that extended as far south as Tombosus in Nubia and included parts of the Levant in the east. The most famous pharaohs such as Adshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti, Tutankhamun and Ramesses II ruled Egypt during this period. The first exposition of the principle of oneness with historical evidence is found in this period. It is called Athenaeum. The contacts with different countries helped to bring new nuclei to Egypt. Later, Libyans, Nubians and Assyrians invaded and conquered Egypt. However, the native people of Egypt drove them out and reclaimed their country. The reign of the pharaohs ended with the reign of the Thirtieth Dynasty. Egypt was conquered by the Persians in 343 BC. The last king, Nectanebo II, was defeated in battle and lost his kingdom. Politics 2011 Egyptian People's Revolution On 25 January 2011, widespread uprisings against the rule of President Ousni Mubarak erupted. Soon it turned into a massive anti-civic movement and people started participating in large numbers. Sensing that the situation was getting out of control, the Mubarak government imposed a curfew on 29 January. But the people continued to fight regardless. On 11 February 2011, Mubarak left Cairo and relinquished his presidency. On 01.02.2011, more than one million people gathered in the capital city of Cairo and the city of Alexandra, which is considered the second capital, and expressed their opposition to Mubarak. Also, people are holding protests in many international countries in support of these protesters. In response to the demands of the people of Egypt, Mubarak, who appeared on national television the day before yesterday, said that he was not going to resign or leave the country, but that he was ready for political restructuring. However, the protestors who refused to comply with Mubarak's renegotiation continued their struggle. On 01.02.2011, the army provided non-violent support and security to the large number of protestors who gathered. In this case, the Egyptian army issued an official announcement on 02.02.2011 and requested the demonstrators to go home and cooperate to maintain law and order in the country. However, the opposition parties refused to comply and said that they will not go home until Mubarak steps down. However, clashes broke out between the two sides after supporters of Egyptian President Osuni Mubarak also gathered in Cairo. Many were killed and injured. At the same time, it was announced that the current parliament in Egypt has been suspended. Also, the Egyptian President agreed to review the results of the elections that were finally held. Meanwhile, a curfew was imposed in some parts of Egypt to curb protests and violence. However, in spite of that, it is noteworthy that people used to stand in groups on the streets and perform the five daily prayers on the streets. Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman announced on 11 February that Mubarak had stepped down and handed over power to a high-ranking military council. Comments from other countries Egypt's protests have received good support from other countries and condemnation from rulers in non-democratic countries in Middle East Asia. Thousands of people from around the world protested in front of Egyptian embassies to show their support for the protest. Jordan's Islamist opposition movement, meanwhile, has said it does not expect Egypt-like protests to happen in its country, but has called for political reform in its country as well. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad called the events in Egypt ""like an epidemic"" and called on leaders to deal with them properly.

"A solar system or solar system is a system formed by the gravitational binding between a star and the surrounding matter. It is defined by the Universal Astronomical Union as consisting of eight planets orbiting the Sun and five asteroids. This system includes large planets orbiting directly around the halo, smaller asteroids and small haloes, and satellites orbiting indirectly around the halo. The radial system formed due to the gravitational contraction of a massive molecular cloud 4.6 billion years ago. The radiator itself carries most of the weight of the system. The next most massive planet is Jupiter. The four planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are known as terrestrial planets. These are usually formed of rocks and metals. The other four exoplanets are more massive than the terrestrial planets. Among them, the largest planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are known as warm giants because they contain mostly hydrogen and helium, while Uranus and Neptune are called cold giants because they contain high-melting-point materials such as methane and ammonia. All move around Katiravan in separate orbital paths. The radial system also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, consists mostly of metals and elements like the inner planets, in which the asteroid Ceres is located. The icy Kuiper Belt lies in Neptune's orbit. It contains the asteroids Pluto, Aumia, MacMac and Aries. Apart from these two areas, various small items also travel unhindered. Satellites orbit six planets, at least four asteroids and many smaller objects. These are also called moons. Each of the exoplanets is surrounded by a planetary ring of dust and debris. The star system is located in Orion's arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION For thousands of years mankind did not understand or accept the radiation system. They believed that the earth was stationary and at the center of the universe. They believed that the earth belonged to a different category than the divine objects traveling through the visible air. Both the Indian mathematician and astronomer Areopatta and the Greek philosopher Aristotle reordered the cosmos [5] as research speculation. A scholar named Arichutarkasu hypothesized a system centered on Katiravana. However, it was Nicolaus Copernicus who mathematically declared that the Sun is at the center of the Sun system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei discovered that Jupiter had a globule and four moons orbiting it. Following up on his discoveries, Christian Aixens found a moon called Titan orbiting Saturn and a ring of planets around Saturn. In 1705 Edmund Ely realized that a comet returns to the same object every 74-75 years. This was the first evidence that objects other than planets exist in the solar system. In 1838, Friedrich Bessel was the first to find a reliable distance between a star and another star through parallax error. The subsequent development of observational astronomy and unmanned spacecraft enabled detailed studies of the solar system. System An astronomical unit is the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Kathiravan Kathiravan is a galaxy in the center of the Kathirava system. Its mass (332,900 Earth masses) accounts for 99.86 percent of the total mass of the solar system. It emits huge amounts of energy by fusing its internal hydrogen atoms with helium. That energy is mostly radiated into space through electromagnetic radiation. Katiravan is a G-type main sequence galaxy. With an absolute magnitude of +4.83, Kathiravan is more luminous than about 85% of the galaxies in the Milky Way. Most of those constellations are constellations. Kathiravan belongs to a metal-rich type of galaxy. The inner part of the solar system consists of four exoplanets or planetary bodies that are densely packed with rocks. Two of them have separate moons. They do not have planetary rings. They mostly contain high melting point metals like sand salts on the outside and metals like iron and nickel in the core. Of the four planets, Venus, Earth and Mars are surrounded by rigid spheres. These are characterized by impressive volcanic ridges and architecturally elegant surfaces. It has rifts and volcanoes. The name subplanet should not be confused with the name inferior planet. Inferior planets are Mercury and Venus, which are closer to the Sun than Earth. Mercury Mercury is the closest planet to the Milky Way and the smallest of the planets in the Milky Way. It is at a distance of 0.4 AU from Katiravan. It has no natural satellites. It is famous for its geological features. Hanging craters are located in pressurized volcanoes. They were probably formed by condensation that occurred during the formation of the ocean [6]. Mercury's atmosphere is negligible. The atoms in it explode on the surface when struck by the radiant wind [7]. It is rich in ferrous metal in the core. Its thin 'mist' has not yet been explained. Tentative theories suggest that its outer layers have been completely stripped away by the impact, or that the energy of the young star has prevented it from accreting.[8][9] Venus Venus is a planet similar in size to Earth. It is at a distance of 0.7 AU from the radius. Like Earth, it has a thick mantle of sandy soil (silicate) around an iron core. It has an atmosphere nine times denser and drier than Earth's. It has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet. Its surface temperature can easily reach 400 °C. This is due to its atmosphere being rich in Pingudil [10]. Current geological activities have not yielded any conclusive evidence of geological activity there. It has no magnetic field to prevent its atmosphere from draining away. Hence its atmosphere is continuously replenished by volcanic emissions [11]. Earth is the largest and densest of the Earth (1 Ma). It is only in this that geological activities continue. Only one planet in the universe has living organisms.[12][12][12][12][12][12][12][12][12][8][7] It is the only terrestrial planet to have a liquid hydrosphere. This feature is unique to this one. And the 'Ndathattu' mechanism found in Earth adds to its uniqueness. Earth's atmosphere is different from the atmospheres of other planets. Such differences arise because oxygen contains 21 percent of the oxygen that organisms need to survive [13]. It has only one natural satellite, the Moon. The moon itself is known as the largest of the satellites of the terrestrial planets in the solar system. Mars Mars (1.5 Ma) is a smaller planet than both Earth and Venus. Its atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide. It also features sprawling volcanoes like 'Olympus Mans' and rift valleys like 'Vallis Marinaris'. They highlight its geographical activities.[14] Its red color is due to the iron oxides [15] it contains. Mars has two small natural satellites. They are called 'Timos' and 'Phobos'.[16][17] Outer Galactic System The outer Galactic System is home to gas giants and their satellites. Many short-lived comets (including the constellations called 'centaurs') orbit. They are filled with rapidly evaporating water, ammonia, and methane because they are located at great distances outwards from the sun. But rocks in the inner core remain solid when cold. Outer Planets There are four outer planets or giant planets in the solar system. Together they orbit Katiravan's circular path with 99 percent accuracy. Jupiter and Saturn have maximum hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune have the most ice. Astronomers therefore classify these separately as 'ice monsters'.[18] All four planets have rings, although only Saturn's rings are easily visible from Earth. Jupiter Jupiter (5.2 Ma) is a planet with 318 times the mass of Earth. That is 2.5 times more than the total mass of other planets. It is formed by both hydra and ileum. Its powerful internal heat has given rise to several permanent features known as the atmosphere, the Milky Way, and the 'Great Red Spot'. Jupiter has sixty-three known moons. Four of its largest moons, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, resemble terrestrial planets. Similar features can be seen in both volcanism and internal heating.[19] The 'Kanimedu' moon is larger than Mercury in the radial system. Saturn Saturn (9.5 Va) has similar features to Jupiter, known for its rings, in its spheroid and magnetosphere. Saturn has 60 percent of Jupiter's volume. But it is third in terms of mass. Saturn is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water. It has 60 known satellites. Among them, the moons 'Titan' and 'Enceladus' have been found to have geological activity. More ice though! [20] Titan, the second largest moon in the solar system, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere. Uranus Uranus (19.6 Ma) is the softest of the 14 exoplanets. A unique feature is that Kathiravan, more than all the planets, orbits on its side in its circular orbit. On the way to Sunday, there is a ninety-degree tilt on the axis - that is, to carry it along. It has a much darker core than other gas monsters. Uranus has 27 known moons and emits very little heat as radiation[21]. The largest moon, Titan, is geologically active. Although Neptune is smaller than Uranus, Neptune (30 Ma) has seventeen times the mass of Earth and is more dense. Its endothermic radiation is greater than that of Jupiter and Saturn.[22] Neptune has fourteen known moons. Among them is the large 'Triton' with geological activity. Also hot springs contain liquid nitrogen [23]. Triton is the only moon with a retrograde orbit. Neptune has many asteroids in its orbit. Called Neptune droids, they have acoustic vibrations in perfect one-to-one ratio The region beyond Neptune The region beyond Neptune's orbital path contains the Kuiper Belt and various asteroids, including Pluto. Sometimes it is also called the third part of the radial system. Kuiper Belt The Kuiper belt is a region of icy material. It lies between 30 AU and 50 AU from Katiravan (30AU-50AU). It is made up of small particles left over after the formation of the nuclear system. Asteroids such as Pluto, Haumea, and Magmac are located in this region. Everything here is made up of water and frozen, flammable methane and ammonia.

"Christopher Columbus (1451–1506) was an Italian explorer, merchant and colonist. He was the first European to cross the Atlantic to America (with the Spanish flag) in 1492. He is believed to be from the Republic of Genoa, Italy.[1][2][3][4] Columbus made four voyages across the ocean to Atlantis during the reign of the Catholic emperors of the Spanish Empire. These voyages and his efforts to establish a permanent settlement on the island of La Española marked the beginning of Spanish settlement in the Americas, known as the New World. The Western imperialist tendency to find new trade routes and establish settlements and the economic competition among European kingdoms led Columbus to propose a circumnavigation of the world to India by traveling west to reach East India. With the support of the Spanish king, Columbus traveled west in 1492 and discovered the New World. He landed on an island in the Bahamas that he later named San Salvador. In three more voyages, Columbus discovered the Greater and Lesser Antilles, Venezuela, and the Caribbean coast of Central America and claimed them for the Spanish Empire. Columbus was the first European to reach the Americas; As early as the 11th century, a Norse group led by Leap Eriksson had landed in North America.[5]) However, it was his voyages that established Europe's first permanent contact with the Americas; This was followed by centuries of European exile, conquest and colonialism. His discovery therefore became an event that had a major impact on the history of the modern Western world.[1] Not accepting that he had reached a new continent that had not yet been discovered by Europeans, Columbus called the people who lived here Indios (Spanish for ""Indians"").[6][7][8] In 1500 he was deposed and arrested as governor of La Españaola due to a dispute with the Spanish emperor over the appointment of administrators to the colonies in the Americas. Later, after long litigation, the rights claimed by Columbus and his successors were granted to them. Historical Significance of Columbus Columbus tried to find a new route to Asia, especially India, and believed that India was what he finally reached. Columbus is considered to be the discoverer of America. Because of his intense involvement, Europe became aware of America. Also, his discovery is responsible for the connection of various continents today. Indeed, Columbus was not the first man to reach the Americas. Because he discovered that people were already living there. Nor was the first European. Because the Vikings traveled to North America from Northern Europe in the 11th century. However, Columbus' voyage was the basis for European settlement of the Americas. That was the main reason for connecting Eurasia and Africa with the Americas. Youth Columbus was born in the Italian port city of Genoa in 1451.[9] His father was Do Minico Colombo, a wool merchant. Mother Susanna Pontanarosa. Columbus had three brothers and one sister. In 1471, Columbus joined a ship owned by Esubenola financiers. He worked for a year on a ship sailing around the area of ​​Chios-Giosu (an island in the Aegean Sea). Returned to the country for a few days He then worked again in the Keosup area for another year.[10] During this period Aegaen was under the control of the Turks (who had captured Constantinople on May 29, 1453). In 1476 Columbus made a trading voyage across the Atlantic. The ship was attacked by French privateers off Cape of St. Vincent. Columbus's ship caught fire and he swam six miles to shore. Columbus lived in Lisbon in 1477. Portugal became a center for maritime activities with ships bound for England, Ireland, Iceland, Madeira, the Azores, and Africa. Columbus's brother Bartholomew was engaged in a cartographic business in Lisbon. Meanwhile, these two siblings became cartographers and book keepers. Columbus became a merchant mariner on Portuguese ships. He went to Iceland in 1477, to Madeira in 1478 to buy sugar, to the West African coast in 1482 and 1485 and to the Guinean coast of São Jorge da Maina, a Portuguese trading post.[1] Columbus married (in 1479) a Portuguese woman named Philippa Berecitello a Monizu. They had a son, Diego. Philippa died in 1485. Columbus later married (in 1488) a woman named Beatriz Enriquez.[11] They had a son named Ferdinand. Home country of Columbus? Columbus's native country is still unknown, but he is generally thought to have been from Genoa, Italy. The history of Columbus before 1470 is not well known. There are those who say that he kept the details of his motherland a secret in order to preserve some mystery in his life. Not only was Columbus able to write in flawless Spanish, but also the letters he wrote to the Italians were in Spanish. Even after the rise of nationalism, the truth about Columbus's mother country was debatable; The celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the discovery of Columbus took place in 1892; Up to that point there was no dispute about Columbus's motherland. The fact that he was from Genoa was a point of pride for Italian Americans. In New York City, anti-Hispanic and Italian community groups created statues of Columbus and installed them in prominent locations such as Columbus Circle and Central Park. Some Pasuk historians claim that Columbus was from Pasuk. Still others believe that he was a Spanish Jew who converted to Christianity, and that he may have concealed details of his motherland, intending to follow the same path as many Spanish Jews who secretly practiced Judaism. Others believe that he was from the island of Corsica, which was under Genoese rule and known for its anti-national activities, and thus may have hid his identity. Some say he was from Catalonia or Greece or Portugal. Origins of Thought In 1480, Columbus devised a plan to sail west across the Atlantic to the Indies (pun intended South and East (Asia)). He believed that this was a faster route than going through South and East (Africa). He seems to have had a hard time getting help for this project (because Europeans at the time believed the Earth was flat). But the navigators and guides of that time knew that the earth was round. A problem with this is that Columbus was unsure how far to the Indies. Many Europeans believed that Ptolemy's concept of land mass (including Eurasia and Africa) consisted of 180 degrees of land and the remaining 180 degrees of water. (Actually it is 120 acres of land, the rest is unknown). Columbus adopted D'Ailly's measurements of 225 fathoms of land and 135 fathoms of water. In particular, he took the Columbus 1 piece a little less than what is generally agreed upon. Finally, Columbus's map measured the Roman mile (5000 feet) rather than the nautical mile (6,082.66 feet at the equator). Columbus determined that Sappan was 2,700 miles from the Canary Islands. In reality the distance is 13,000 miles, and most European navigators and explorers doubted that the Indies were so far away. Voyages Between 1492 and 1503, Columbus made four voyages from Espanola to the Americas. All these four expeditions were hosted by the Kingdom of Kasut. These marked the beginning of the European Age of Discovery and the colonization of the Americas. These are therefore significant events in Western history.[12] Despite the evidence to the contrary, Columbus was always convinced that the lands he discovered belonged to Asia described by Marco Polo and other European travelers.[12] This refusal was one of the reasons he chose to name the new continents America after the Florentine explorer Americo Vespucci.[13] First voyage Columbus first presented his plan to the Portuguese royal council in 1485. But the king's experts believed that Columbus' route was bigger than Columbus thought. So they rejected it. Columbus then sought the court of Spain. But after several days of persuasion, he obtained their consent in 1492. The Spanish king and queen (Pertinent of Aragon, Isabella of Castile) had just captured Granada, the last Muslim stronghold. They said they would bear the cost of the trip. Columbus had already planned to raise half of the cost from private sources. Columbus was crowned Commander of the Seas, promised to be the governor of the newly discovered islands, and the government agreed to pay him a large share of the revenue. On August 3 of that year, Columbus set sail from Palos in three ships, the Santa Maria, the Niña, and the Pinta.[14] First he reached the Canary Islands. He stayed there for a month. Then he embarked on a great journey. He cheated his sailors by recording in his notebooks less than the distance he had traveled. Although it is still disputed which island he reached first, it is certain that he must have reached an island in the Bahamas. He landed on October 12, 1492. He encountered Native American tribes there. They are Tien or Arawak, very peaceful and friendly. In an October 14, 1492 note to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain, Columbus wrote the following about Tiagot;no. ""If the King pleases, they may all be brought to Castile; or made hostages in their own island. I leave fifty of them in your charge. You may do with them what you please."" Columbus was on his first voyage to Cuba and La España (October 28).The Santa Maria ran aground, forcing him to abandon it. Columbus established a settlement called La Navidad there and left 39 people with him. On January 4, 1493, he sailed back home, but a storm forced him to land in Portugal. He was arrested and released there because the relationship between Portugal and Castile was very bad at that time. Then on 15th March he reached Esupania. There he handed over the gold he had brought and the American tribes he had brought to the court. There he explained about tobacco, pineapple and pineapple, which were unknown till then. There he was received as a knight. News of his discovery spread around the world. Second Voyage He embarked on his second voyage (1493–1496) on 24 September 1493. Diano set out in 17 ships with 1200 men and supplies to subjugate the Aborigines and colonize the islands. This time he went further south than before. First to Dominica, and later Heading north, he discovered and named islands in the Lesser Antilles: Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, and Nevis. He landed on the islands and claimed them as part of Spain, like the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. He then went to La Ezupaniola, where he learned that those he had left behind had been killed in a fight with the natives. In the Isabela Islands on the north coast of La Española (where he first found gold), he established settlements. set up But here he did not make as much gold as he thought. Later he discovered that he was finding gold in the interior of Isabella Island. He built a small fort there. Traveled along the southern coast of Cuba and later learned that it was a peninsula, not an island. Then he discovered Jamaica. During his second journey he was advised by Ferdinand and Isabella to be friendly with the inhabitants. But Columbus on his second voyage sent a letter to the king asking for the right to enslave the inhabitants. Because he felt that the inhabitants of Garib were rogues. Although his request was refused, Columbus made 1,600 Arawak hostages in February, 1495. 550 men were sent by ship to Eusbania. 200 of them died on board (probably from disease). Half of those who reached Spain were ill. But those who came to Esupania were again sent back by ship. This enslavement of American citizens led to conflicts between the Spanish and the natives. Gold was the most important goal of Columbus' voyage. For that he persuaded the inhabitants of the Chicao Islands in Eighty to a plan. He threatened them that each of them should bring a certain amount of gold. He also threatened to cut off the hands of those who did not bring it. Even so, he could not get that much gold. He often emphasized the need for slavery in his letters to the Spanish king. But they were also rejected by the king. They wanted the royal family to be future members of the American Catholic Church. In particular, Columbus used the encomienda, a plan of the Spanish to hire American citizens if they converted them to Christianity, with a selfish point of view. This program led to the enslavement of American citizens. Sometimes Indians worked themselves to death. Sometimes they died from disease and malnutrition spread to them by the Europeans. There are different opinions about the pre-Columbian population. Bartholomew de las Casas conducted a census in 1496. It suggests that there were 3,000,000 dinos. A Spanish census taken in 1514 indicates that there were 22,000 dianos. A census in 1542 shows that there were only 200 people. Columbus left Hispaniola for Europe on March 10, 1496, appointing his siblings as officers of these settlements. His siblings and other Spaniards carried out Columbus' plan, the encomienda, throughout the Americas. Columbus was appointed governor of the islands he discovered. He also undertook various voyages in the Atlantic Ocean. Although he was a great seafarer, he was considered a poor administrator. So he was removed from the governorship in 1500. Third Voyage and Arrest In 1498, Columbus set out for the New World for the third time, accompanied by the young Bartholomew de las Casas (who later provided Columbus' notes). This time he discovered the Trinidad Islands on 31 July. He also discovered the land of South America. There he also saw the Orinoco River. He first said that these landmasses were the New Continent, then changed them to parts of Asia. The Spanish colonists were deceived by Columbus's exaggerated claims about the New World. Columbus had to settle disputes between the colonists and the Native Americans. He even executed Spaniards who did not listen to him. Many who returned to Spain therefore accused Columbus of slander. The king and queen sent a royal administrator named Francisco de Popatilla in 1500. He came and arrested Columbus and his brothers and sent them to Spain. Columbus refused to remove his handcuffs until he returned to Spain, at which point he wrote a detailed letter to the King of Spain. Although he was released in Spain, his governorship was not restored. And painfully, the Portuguese won the race for the Indies: Vasco da Gama returned from a voyage to India in September 1499 (traveling east through Africa). Last Voyage and Last Phase of Life Columbus made his last voyage in 1502-1504 (leaving Spain on May 9, 1502). He took his youngest son Ferdinand with him on this trip. Traveled from Belize to Panama in what is now Central America. In 1502 he encountered a cargo ship off the coast of what is now Honduras. This was the first encounter of the Mesoamerica civilization of the Spanish with the Amerindians. Then Columbus had to spend a year in Jamaica. He then sent two men in canoes to Hispaniola for help. In this case, he earned the respect of the American children by predicting the lunar eclipse very accurately. Finally He got help. He then returned to Spain in 1504. Columbus used to say that he was sailing to convert non-Christians to Christianity. In his old age he became very spiritual. He even claimed to hear the voice of God. He came dressed as a Franciscan, claiming to be on a crusade to reclaim Jerusalem. He used to call his inventions heaven and they were God's plan. During his last days, Columbus asked the Spanish government to give him ten percent of the profits from the new islands. But the Spanish king rejected this. Columbus died on May 20, 1506. Even then he was convinced that what he had discovered was the east coast of Asia. His journey continued even after his death. First in Valladolid, then in Seville, and then by his son Diego, then Governor of Hispaniola, whose body was brought to Santa Domingo at his request. Brought in 1542. In 1795 it was moved to Havana due to the French conquest. After the 1898 war, when Cuba became an independent country, his body was brought back to Spain and placed in the Cathedral of Seville. But many still believe his body is in Santa Domingo. Later Life Although Columbus made conversion a goal of his voyages, he became very religious in his later days. With the help of his son Diego and friend Casabar Corrizio, Columbus published two books: the Book of Privileges (1502), which described the rights the Spanish government owed to himself and his successors, and the Book of Prophecies (1505), which considered the achievements of his voyages as biblical prophecies.[12][17] He asked the Spanish king to give him 10% of all profits from the new lands; But the king rejected this demand saying that the agreement was terminated after his removal from the governorship. Even after Columbus's death, his heirs sued the king. The case was too long. These cases are called Colombian lawsuits (pleitos colombinos). In ill health he encountered a severe storm on the return leg of his last voyage; 41 Inferior Columbus is now about arthritis. In the years that followed he suffered from influenza and other illnesses. The severity of gout also increases. As a result, he had to stay in bed for several months. It was these ailments that led to his death in fourteen years. Based on Columbus' lifestyle and symptoms, modern doctors believe that what happened to him was not arthritis but Reiter's syndrome.[18][19] Reiter's syndrome is a joint disease caused by intestinal infections; It can also come from sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia or gonorrhea. Maru, a rheumatologist and professor at the Texas Medical School, said he may have contracted food poisoning somewhere during his voyages. Frank C. Arnett considers.[18] Columbus died in Valladolid, Spain on May 20, 1506, in his 54th year. Columbus' body was first interred in Valladolid. It was later transferred to a chapel in La Cartuja, Seville, by the will of his son Diego, who was later governor of La Españaola. Transferred to colonial Santo Domingo (modern Dominican Republic) in 1542. In 1795, La Española was taken over by France and moved back to Havana, Cuba. When Cuba was liberated after the Spanish-American War in 1898, all three were taken to Spain and placed on an ornate plinth in the Cathedral of Seville [21]. A lead casket marked ""Don Christopher Columbus"" was found in Santo Domingo in 1877; It contained bone fragments and gunpowder. D. of the body in Sevia in June 2003 to resolve the confusion that the wrong bodies were thus transferred to Avana. N. A. Elements Columbus' younger brother, son d. N. were compared with A components. Initially, there appeared to be no bones that could correlate with Columbus's age and build;[22] T.N. A was also hard to come by; Only minor components of filamentous deoxy-ribonucleic acid were found. The deoxy-ribonucleic acid components of these filaments were identical to those of columbus's sibling; Both were confirmed to be born of the same mother.[23] Based on this evidence and other anthropological and historical analyses, the researchers concluded that the remains in Seville were those of Columbus.[24] Officials in Santo Domingo refused to allow the remains to be exhumed for examination; Thus it was not possible to confirm that the remains were parts of Columbus's body.[24][25] In Santo Domingo this tomb is located at the ""Lighthouse of Columbus"" (Faro a Colón). Conflicting Perceptions of Columbus Beyond Columbus' actions and achievements, he is considered culturally significant; He has become an icon and an epoch. Speculations about him portray him from one angle as a historical hero and from another angle as an enemy of humanity. Depending on one's view of the arrival of Europeans in the new lands and the subsequent spread of Christian and Roman Catholic beliefs, Columbus is portrayed both positively and negatively. Columbus - An Incomparable Man By 1892, the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America, the trend to celebrate Columbus reached its peak. Statues of him have been erected in the United States and Latin America. The argument that, unlike his contemporaries, Columbus was the only one who believed that the world was round was repeatedly asserted, and this argument was used to highlight that Columbus was the most progressive and the greatest scholar. Columbus, who defied tradition and traveled west to reach the East, was celebrated as a testament to American creativity. In particular, the Catholic, Italian-American, and Hispanic communities living in the United States were active in spreading the fame of Columbus. Oppressed by American hegemony, these communities pointed to the achievements of Columbus as an example that Mediterranean Catholics could also contribute to the United States. Columbus - Enemy of Mankind Columbus was a conflicted man. Some, especially Native Americans, see him as the direct or indirect cause of Europe's exploitation of the Americas and the enslavement of the West Indies. Although the religious leader Bartholomew de las Casas had written about the atrocities Columbus committed, after the 1960s there was a widespread tendency to see him as a symbol of the evils of European imperialism – enslavement, genocide, cultural destruction. Some consider his atrocities as viceroy (regent) and governor sufficient reason to charge him with genocide. In recent times, propaganda about Columbus's achievements and Columbus Day celebrations have come under heavy criticism. In 1992, there was strong opposition to the 500th anniversary celebrations of Columbus' first voyage. Subsequently, in October 2002, Venezuelan President Cuo Chávez signed a resolution renaming Columbus Day ""Day of Internal Resistance"". The commemoration of Columbus' landing in the Americas in 1492 is celebrated on October 12 in all American countries except Canada and Spain. In Spain it is celebrated as Fiesta Nacional de Espana y Día de la Hispaniat. Many Latin American countries celebrate it as Día de la Raza. In the United States, it is Columbus Day and is celebrated on the second Monday of October every year. The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago marked the four hundredth anniversary of Columbus's landing.[26] Over 27 million people visited the six-month fair. The United States Postal Service also participated in the games and released a commemorative stamp set of 16 stamps; These marked different stages of the voyages of Columbus, Queen Isabella, and others. These ranged in value from one cent to $5. These commemorative stamps were very popular and sold in great numbers. A total of two billion stamps were sold in six months; The two-cent ""Arrival of Columbus"" stamp accounted for 72%.[27] In 1992, a second such stamp set was issued to celebrate the 500th centenary. Although these were copies of the first stamps, only the date was changed in the right corner. Along with the United States, Italy, Portugal, and Spain also issued these notes in their currencies.[28] Legacy Remains Widespread in American and European literature is the idea that Columbus ""discovered America,"" although the actual first discoverers were locals who had lived here for a long time. Not even a European since Columbus; The Vikings were the first Europeans to arrive. But it was Columbus who popularized America in Europe. By bringing the new land to Western attention, he established a lasting connection between the two major landmasses of the Earth and the people who lived there. Historian Martin Dugard has stated that ""Columbus's glory is not that he was the first to reach America, but that he was the first to stay there"".[30] Although historians have generally assumed that the land discovered by Columbus was part of Asia until the end,[31] Kirkpatrick Sale notes that Columbus found a new continent in his Book of Privileges.[32] Additionally, records of the third voyage mention ""pariah land"", a continent ""as yet unseen"".[33] While other documents of Columbus mentioned reaching Chia; In a letter to Pope Alexander VI in 1502 he referred to Cuba as the eastern seaboard of Asia.[34] He also called the new continent of South America an earthly paradise at the end of the Orient.[33] So, it is not clear what his real views were. Americo Vespucci, who traveled to America after Columbus' first voyage, was the first to suggest that this land was not Asia but a new continent unknown to Eurasians. German cartographer Martin Waltzmüller came to this conclusion through the travelogues of Americo Vespucci, published in 1502-04. In his map of the world published in 1507, the year after Columbus's death, Waltzmüller called the new continent America; It comes from Vespucci's Latin name for ""America"". For many years, the British celebrated Venetian John Cabot as the first explorer, not Columbus. But Cabot did not gain national recognition in the emerging United States. The cult of Columbus grew in America from the time of colonization. The name Columbia for America appeared in British parliamentary debates in 1738.[36] After the American Revolution, the idea that Columbus was the discoverer of the New World spread throughout America. Columbus is named after the federal capital of the United States (District of Columbia), two state capitals (Ohio, South Carolina), and the Columbia River. The forerunner of present-day Colombia was named Gran Colombia outside the United States in 1819. Many cities, towns, counties, roads and shopping complexes are named after him. He was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1866. The 400th anniversary of his arrival in America was celebrated in 1892 as the culmination of such worship.

"White tiger is a type of tiger with rare genes. This gene is responsible for the white color of white tigers with their stripes. White tigers also breed with yellow tigers. This causes their fur to develop a reddish-yellow color. The only exception is that if the red-and-yellow tiger is already a hybrid, there is a 50% chance that each cub will be either a rare white tiger or a red-and-yellow tiger. When tigers with two different ovules breed, there is a 25% chance that their offspring will be white tigers. But there are also chances of being red and yellow hybrid tigers. In 1970, a pair of yellow tigers named Shashi and Ravi gave birth to 13 cubs at the Alipore Zoo; Three of them are white tiger cubs.[4] If two white tigers breed, 100 percent of their cubs will be identical white tigers. Breeding between members of the same family increases homogeneity. White tigers are much larger both at birth and at maturity compared to yellow tigers that do not have white genes.[5] Apart from their different color scheme, being larger in size is also an advantage for them. This makes them look terrible. In the 1960s, the director of the New Delhi Zoo, Kailash Shankala, said, ""Even if the white gene is not necessary, it is necessary to retain the gene to some extent among its population"".[6] Currently, hundreds of white tigers are captured worldwide. There are about 100 tigers in India. Their numbers are also increasing. It is unclear whether the rare genes for the white tiger came only from Bengal tigers or from other Siberian ancestors as well. Because of this unique coloration of white tigers, they are becoming very popular in zoos and other entertainment centers. Siegfert & Roy are famous for breeding two white tigers and training them to perform tricks. Ron Holliday, Joy Holliday and Chuck Lijja made an HBO documentary about a trio of tigers performing tricks. When they performed this show with a white tiger, two individuals were killed. White Tigers in the Wild An article appeared in the Journal Of The Bombay Natural History, November 15, 1909. The article mentioned that a white tigress was shot dead in the Mulin sub-division forest of Thenkanal district in Orissa. Prior to this announcement, in May 1909, in the Indian Forester, Katilaka officer Mr. Published by Bavis Singh. It was reported that the white tigress had been shot in an attempt to kill a buffalo and was in ""good condition with no signs of illness"". Col. F.T. Pollock, writing in Wild Game in Burma and Assam, says, ""I have seen the skin of a tiger in Edwin Wards, Wimpole Street. And Mr. Shadwal, Sub-Inspector of the Gosyah and Jinteh Hills, also has two completely white skins."" In his book Animal Games in India (1907), Mr. Ledecker wrote about five different skins of white tigers.""[7] The first white tiger in Europe was a white tiger exhibited in 1820 at London's Etchiteur Change. In A Book on Indian Animals, S.H. Prater writes that ""all-white or partially white tigers are not commonly found in some of the open dry forests of central India"".[8] It is just a myth that white tigers cannot survive in the wild. India plans to reintroduce captive-bred white tigers into the forest in the Special Zone near Rewa.[9] In his book Wild Animals in Central India, A.A. Udunbar Brander writes, ""White tigresses are seldom seen. In the Rewa Government, at the junction of the Mandala and Bilaspur Districts, near Amarganthak, these animals usually breed. When I was last at Mandala in 1919, there was one white tigress and two or three full-grown white tiger cubs. A male white tiger was captured and imprisoned by the Rewa Government in 1915. An account of the animal written by Mr. Scott, who served in the Indian Police, was published in Volume 27 of the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society.[10] Among other notes in the Journal Of The Bombay Natural History: ""A white tigress in a cage at Rewa was caught in the jungles near Sohagpur in December 1915. It was then about two years old. Two other white tigresses related to that tigress were in South Rewa. But the mother was not a white tigress. It was believed that about 10 or 12 years ago, a white tiger was killed by a Sikh near Sahdol, B.N.Ry. The one in Bilam Dunkari Forest was said to be a sibling of the one in the jail. These white tigers seem to be roaming near the central districts.""[11][12] Reports made by Pollock in the 1900s indicate evidence of white tigers in the Jinteh Hills of Burma and Meghalaya. Between 1892 and 1922, white tigers were shot and killed in Poona, Upper Assam, Orissa, Balispur and Cooch Bihar. In the 1920s and 1930s, white tigers were shot and killed in various areas. Fifteen tigers were also shot dead in Bihar during the same period. In 1943, Victor H. Sahalen wrote extensively about white tigers in northern China.[13] However, white tigers are not pale creatures. White tigers have also been found in northern China and Korea.[14][15] Jim Corbett photographed a white tigress in the wild with two yellow cubs. The film is based on the 1957 book written by Jim Corbett. White tigers can also survive in the wild; And this is another proof that reproduction is possible. On the website of Bandhavgarh National Park, pictures of white tigers have been published. The website mentions, ""The forests of Bandhavgarh were the forests of white tigers in earlier years"". Today, there are 46 to 52 yellow tigers in Bandhavgarh. This is the highest number for any national park in India.[16] White Siberian Tigers By the middle of the twentieth century, the wild Siberian tiger population had become almost extinct. Even today, the natural birth of a white Bengal tiger is a very rare event in the wild. Estimates suggest that out of every 10,000 wild tigers born, only about one in 1 is likely to be a white tiger. The white tiger is not considered to be a subspecies of tigers, but rather a mutation of the existing subspecies of tigers. Due to the popularity of white tigers, it attracts visitors to the zoo. It is also believed to help raise awareness about tigers and their plight. Unlined white tigers and golden striped tigers can even eliminate the lines on a white tiger if they are genetically complementary. This makes it look like a completely white animal. In 1820, one such tiger was put on public display at the Exeter Challenge in England. Georges Couvier notes that ""the lines of a white tiger are sometimes not reflected by light, but only at certain angles of light. At other times they are invisible"".[17] Naturalist Richard Ledecker reports that ""a white tiger, light in color and with its usual lines faintly visible in some parts, was exhibited to the public in the old menagerie of Exeter Change about 1820"".[18] One of four tiger cubs at the Cincinnati Zoo, Bhim and Sumitra, were born without lines. White cubs with lines were sold to zoos around the world. Untamed white tigers can also be found in zoos as far away as the Czech Republic, Spain and Mexico. Arena magicians Shekferret & Roy were the first to attempt to tame untamed tigers; They purchased white Bengal tigers (Sumura, Mantra, Mirage, and Akbar-Kabul) from the Cincinnati Zoo and an unraced Siberian tiger named Apollo from Gautalajara, Mexico (Vishnu and Jahan).[19] In 2004, a blue-eyed, unlined white tiger was born at a wildlife camp in Alicante, Spain. Its parents are ordinary yellow Bengal tigers. The cub was named Artico (literally, ""Artic""). Lineless white tigers were considered infertile until Chiengferit, a daughter of Bhim and Sumitha, and Sithara, Rai's lineless white tigress, gave birth. From the white tigers also emerged unusual pale-reddish tigers. These were called ""Tigers with Golden Stripes"". Since these are rare, there is a possibility that they are yellow tigers with genes from unlined white tigers. Some of the white tigers in India are very pale and between white and yellow. HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS Fifty years before 1960, Rewa's hunters' diaries contain references to 9 white tigers. According to the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 17 white tigers were shot between 1907 and 1933. By 1959, 35 white tigers were captured from the wild by E.P. Gee has counted. Many more were unaccounted for in Assam. He had a tea garden there. However, Gee noted that Assam was considered an ideal habitat for black tigers due to its dense forests. Some white tigers in the wild also have red stripes. These were called ""Red Tigers"". In the early 1900s two white tigers were shot dead in a tea plantation in Assam. Arthur Luke, writing in ""The Tigers of Itrinkanu"" (1954), mentions white tigers. In some areas, these tigers also form a heritage for the area. In China, the god of the west is worshiped as Baihu (Pyoko in Japan and Byok-ho in Korea). In South Korea, a white tiger is emblazoned on the flag as a symbol of Daejeok - the white tiger represents ferocity, the opposite dragon represents goodness. In India, a white tiger was believed to be an incarnation of the Hindu god Mr, and anyone who killed it would die within a year. In Java the white tiger was thought to be associated with departed Hindu kings, spirits and souls. It was also a seal of protection in the seventeenth century court. White tigers with dark stripes have been recorded in Indian forests during the Mughal Empire (1556 – 1605). A 1590 painting by Akbar shows four tigers hunting near Gwalior. Two of them are white tigers.[12] You can see this sketch on the website, . About 17 incidents of white tigers were recorded between 1907 and 1933 in different parts of India. On January 22, 1939, the Prime Minister of Nepal shot and killed a white tiger at Partha Camp in Terai, Nepal. The last known wild white tiger was shot in 1958. And it is believed that the mutated creature that evolved from it may exist in the wild.[9] Since then there have been rumors of white tigers in the wilds of India. But nothing is convincing. A photograph by Jim Corbett (1946)[20] shows two yellow tigresses and a white tigress. It showed that white tigers lived and bred in the wild. This image was used in a National Geographic documentary, ""Man-eaters of India"" (1984). It was taken from Courbet's life and the foundation of his 1957 book of the same title. In 1965, Marjorie Merriweather Post had an old asana made from the skin of a white tiger. It was at his Hillwood Ranch in Washington DC. It is currently functioning as a museum. A color photograph of this object was published in the November 5, 1965 issue of Life magazine.[21] In the October 1975 issue of National Geographic magazine, a photo of a stuffed white tiger was published by the Minister of Defense of the United Arab Emirates in his office.[22] Actor Cesar Romero also owned the skin of a white tiger. White tigers feature heavily in mass culture literature, video games, television, and children's storybooks. An example of this is Sweden's Kent Rock band. The band featured a white tiger on the cover of their 2002 album Vapen & Ammunition. White Tiger was also featured in the song ""Humans"", filmed by the famous American synth-rock band The Killers. White Tiger is also the name of an American glam metal band from the 1980s. Arvind Adika's novel 'White Tiger' won the Booker Prize in 2008. It is also written that the main character refers to himself as the White Tiger. He is given that nickname in the story because he was exceptional as a child and was more energetic than others. Zoo Tycoon and Warcraft universe are games that refer to white tigers. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the Japanese Super Sentai series both make use of the White Tiger. The Power Rangers series was based on these. The White Ranger from Power Rangers: Wild Force and his antagonist, the Sentai, also have the powers of the White Tiger. A white tiger trained at the Bowmanville Zoo in Ontario, Canada was used to star in the Animorphs television series.

"A plant or plant is a large group of organisms that includes trees, plants, vines, grasses, etc. These organisms are called stationary as they do not move from one place to another. It is estimated that there are about 350,000 plant species. Among these, up to 287,655 species have been identified. Commonly known trees, plants, vines, grasses etc. are not plants but ferns, algae (Algae in English) etc. are also plants. Among the plants identified are approximately 258,650 species of flowering plants. 18,000 bryophytes. Uses Plants are what make all the land on this earth even in water and allow other creatures to live in this world. Plant sizes also range from very small aquatic algae to sequoia trees that can reach over 100 meters (330 feet) in height. We use only a few of these for food, clothing, medicine and shelter. Important among them are rice, wheat, cotton, maize, tobacco etc. Many countries' economies and even governments depend on it. More importantly, it is not an exaggeration to say that plants are the foundation of the industrial world when we see that the gasoline, kerosene, and diesel that we use now are obtained from the green plants that lived billions of years ago. And over billions of years, as plants exposed to more oxygen in the air, animals evolved and higher species began to appear. The most fundamental role of plants in human life can be realized when we see that plants can protect against soil erosion, soil erosion, stabilize soil fertility, rainfall and healthy climate. Plants are the basis of all life in the world. Definition The Greek scholar Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) divided all living things into two major categories: plants (phytes) and animals (phytes). According to Linnaeus' system in the 18th century, these were two kingdoms, Vegetabilia and Animalia. The kingdom Vegetabilia was later called Plantae. Over time many species that were initially suppressed in the Plantae kingdom became known to be unrelated. Fungi and several species of algae (algae) were transferred to different kingdoms. However, they are still considered plants in many situations. concepts Plants are referred to by one of the following three concepts. They are: Land Plants: These are also known as Embryophyta, Metaphyta etc. Green Plants: Also known as Viridiphyta, Chlorophinata etc. This includes the land plants mentioned earlier. They also include Charophyta and Chlorophyta. Archaeplastida: Also known as Plastida, Primoplanta, it includes all green plants and also includes Rhodophyta and Glucophyta. Plant Classification According to biological classification, early taxonomists gave more priority to external physical characteristics of plants. Later scholars (notably Linnaeus) placed more emphasis on the floral characteristics of plants. Because the characteristics of the flower are constant and permanent without change. Also, flowering plants were divided into two types, monocots and dicots. The early various classifications were divided into three systems. Synthetic method – (eg) Linnaeus method – described with 7300 specimens. Natural Method - (eg) Bentham-Cooker Classification Genetic Method - (eg) Adolf Engler(1844-1930) and Karl Brandl(1849-1893) both stated. Experimental taxonomy – came up in 1943 by Camp and Gill Nomenclature Nomenclature for plants is governed by the following systems. International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, According to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (IPG III system - Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III system) of 2009, these are classified into eight groups. They are as follows;- Amborella Nymphaeales (Nymphaeales) Autropian (Austrobaileyales) Appetizers (Chloranthales) Magnoliidae Monocotyledonae Ceratophyllum Eudicotyledonae (Eudicotyledonae) Diversity Plant Cell Plant cells are cells that contain a nucleus. One of the highlights is the presence of greens required for photosynthesis. They contain many specialized structures not found in animal cells. Kalachuvar, Pachaiavurumani and Periya Punvettidam are the highlights of the botanical gardens.

"Mexico (Spanish: México, ""México"") is a federal republic on the North American continent. Formally it is known as the United Mexican States.[1] The United States of America forms its northern border. To the south and west is the Pacific Ocean. On the southeast border are the countries of Guatemala and Belize and the Caribbean Sea. On the eastern border lies Mexico City.[2] With an area of ​​approximately two million square kilometers (over 760,000 square miles)[3], Mexico is the fifth largest country in the Americas by area and the 13th largest independent country in the world. With a population of 113 million[4] it is the 11th most populous country in the world and the most Spanish-speaking country in the world. Its capital is Mexico City. 31 states join the federal system of Mexico. Besides these, the capital is a federal district. Many cultures matured in pre-Columbian Mexico, culminating in the Olmec, Tholtec, Teotihuacan, Sapotec, Maya, and Azutec civilizations. In 1521, Spain conquered parts of Mexico and established settlements from its base at Mexico-Tenochtitlan. These areas were administered as viceroyalties of the new Esuppain. After the colony's independence was accepted in 1821, these territories became Mexico. In the post-independence period, Mexico faced economic instability, the Mexican-American War, the loss of territories to the United States, civil war, the creation of two empires, and a local dictatorship. Dictatorship spawned the Mexican Revolution of 1910. This was followed by the constitution of 1917 and the present political system. In the elections held in July 2000, the Ethical party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, won the presidency for the first time. Enrique Peña Nieto of that party took office as the President of Mexico.[5] Mexico has one of the largest economies in the world, and is a regional superpower and a middle power. Also, Mexico is the first member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in Latin America. It has been a member of this organization since 1994. Mexico is projected as an upper-middle income country by the World Bank. It is a newly industrialized country and an emerging dynamic country. Mexico has the 13th largest nominal GDP and the 11th largest purchasing power parity. The country's economy is strongly linked to the economies of its North American Free Trade Agreement partners, particularly the United States. Mexico ranks sixth in the world and first in the Americas in terms of the total number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. There are a total of 31 World Heritage Sites here. In 2007, Mexico had the 10th largest foreign tourist arrivals in the world. 21.4 million passengers arrived that year. Since 2006, Mexico has been in the middle of a drug war. Due to this, up to 60,000 people have died. When the region, originally called New Spain, gained independence from Spain, they decided to name the new country after its capital, Mexico City. Mexico City was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Aztec capital Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Although the name is derived from the Nawathil language, the meaning of the word is not clear. ""Mēxihco"" (Mēxihco) in Nahuatl refers to the heartland of the Aztec Empire, the Valley of Mexico, its people, and the surrounding areas. It was a section of the new Essbein before independence. The word is generally considered a toponym for a valley. It was later used as an ethnonym for the Asuttek triad. It could have been the other way around. The suffix -ko is a transpositional element in Nahuatl language. Its combination makes a word a toponym. The name of the country has also changed depending on the system of government. For two periods (1821–1823, 1863–1867) it was known as the ""Mexican Empire"" (Imperio Mexicano - Imperio Mexicano). The name ""United Mexican States"" (Estados Unidos Mexicanos) was used in all three federal constitutions (1824, 1857, 1917). In the Constitution of 1836 it was named the ""Republic of Mexico"". Geography Mexico is located in the southern part of North America between latitudes 14° and 33°N and longitudes 86° and 119°E. Almost all of Mexico's landmass lies on the North American continent. Only parts of the Baja California Archipelago are on the Pacific continent and on the Cocos continent. Geographically, some geologists include the region east of the Teguantapec Isthmus within Central America.[6] Geographically, all of Mexico is considered to be part of North America, along with Canada and the United States.[7] With a total area of ​​1,972,550 square kilometers (761,606 sq mi), Mexico is the 14th largest country in the world by area. In addition, the country covers an area of ​​approximately 6,000 square kilometers (2,317 sq mi) and includes several islands located in the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of California. Based on the distance between the two most distant points on Mexico's landmass, the length of Mexico is more than 3,219 kilometers (2,000 mi). Mexico shares a 3,141 kilometers (1,952 mi) long common border with the United States to its north. To the south it shares an 871 km (541 mi) long border with Guatemala and a 251 km (156 mi) long border with Belize. Mexico has two mountain ranges from north to south, the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra Madre Occidental. It is a series of rocky mountains starting from northern North America. Across the country from east to north is the Sierra Nevada volcanic range in its middle. A fourth mountain range, the Sierra Madre del Sur, runs from Michoacán to Oaxaca.[8] So for the most part, the northern and central parts of Mexico are high elevations. The highest elevations are found in the Trans-Mexico volcanic region. Among these, Pico de Orizaba (5,799 m, 18,701 ft), Popocattabeth (5,462 m, 17,920 ft), Isudaxivath (5,286 m, 17,343 ft) and Nevado de Toluca (4,577 m, 15,016 ft) are important. In the valleys located between these four yarams, three important urban areas are located. These are Toluca, Peru, Mexico City, and Puebla.[8] Administrative Divisions Gulf of Mexico Pacific Ocean Central America United States of America Mexico City AG Baja California Baja California On Campeche Chiapas Chihuahua Coahuila Colima Durango Guanajuato Guerrero HD Jalisco EM Michoacan MO Nayarit Nuevo León Oaxaca Puebla Queretaro Quintana Roo saint Louis Potosi Sinaloa Sonora Tabasco Tamaulipas TL Veracruz Yucatan Zacatecas ""United Mexican States"" means a confederation of 31 independent and sovereign states. The union thus constituted has limited jurisdiction over the Federal Districts of Mexico and other jurisdictions. Each state has its own constitution, state congress, and judiciary. The state governor is directly elected by the people through elections every six years. Members of the State Council are also elected by the people every three years.[9] A federal district is a special political division administered by a central government. It does not belong to any state. It has limited local government powers.[10] States are divided into municipalities. It is the smallest of all political divisions. It is governed by a popularly elected mayor or municipal head.[11] Citations Category:North American countries Category:Member States of the United Nations ",What is the area of ​​Mexico?,Two million square kilometers,431
"Computer software or software is a general term used primarily for computer programs and data that can be read and written by computers and stored numerically, such as other types of information. Today the term also includes data not normally associated with a computer, such as film reels, tapes, and recordings.[1] The term is coined to contrast with the older term hardware (i.e. physical devices); Software, as opposed to hardware, refers to the intangible, meaning ""untouchable"".[2] Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, i.e. application software. Examples: Application software, such as word processors that do useful work for users. A software-programmable enclosure for electronically programmable memory devices such as firmware, embedded motherboards, or other types of integrated hardware conductors. The core program controls and coordinates distributed systems. System software consists of computing resources and operating platforms that provide convenience to users. Software testing is a field of development and programming. Software testing includes several methods of testing and declaring a software product suitable before it is released for use by an individual or group. Testing software is a general term or container term for all applications and application software that function concurrently with testing a software module, but are not necessarily optional for contributing functional purposes. Similarly, a test program is not a static script but a working environment for the application software or its components. Video games (excluding hardware) Websites Overview Software includes the various forms and roles that digitally stored data can have and run on a computer (or similar system), regardless of whether the data is used as a code or other object descriptor for the CPU, or whether it represents some other type of information. Software thus encompasses a wide range of products that can be developed using various techniques such as conventional programming languages, scripting languages, microcoding or FPGA. This type of software includes web pages created in languages ​​and design languages ​​like HTML, PHP, Perl, JSP, ASP.NET, XML, and desktop applications like OpenOffice and Microsoft Word written in languages ​​like C, C++, Java, C# or Smalltalk. includes Application software usually runs on embedded operating platforms such as Linux or Microsoft Windows. Software (or firmware) is used in video games and in the design components of the logic systems of vehicles, televisions, and other consumer electronic devices. Computer software is so-called to distinguish it from computer hardware (hardware), which includes the built-in interfaces and peripherals required to store and execute (or execute) the software. Minimal implementation code includes machine language instructions for individual implementations. A machine language contains groups of binary values ​​that specify executable instructions that change the state of the computer from a previous state. Programming dictates a sequence of instructions to change the state of the computer in a particular sequence. It is usually written in high-level programming languages ​​(such as natural languages) that are easier for humans to use and more useful than machine languages. High-level languages ​​are compiled or interpreted into machine language target code. Software can also be written in assembly language, specifically the mnemonic expression of machine language that uses the natural language alphabet. Assembly language must be compiled into object code via a compiler. The term ""software"" was first used in this context by John W. Turkey in 1958.[3] In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all computer programs. The theory underlying most modern software was first proposed by Alan Turing in 1935 in his paper Computable Numbers with Applications to Numsteidungsproblem (decisional mathematics).[4] Types of Software Practical computer systems divide software systems into three main categories: system software, programming software, and application software, although this distinction remains arbitrary and ambiguous. System Software System software helps operate the computer hardware and the computer system. It includes the following links: Device drivers Operating platform servers benefits Window Systems The purpose of system software is to reduce the burden on the applications programmer since the details of the particular computer being used remain complex, including accessories such as communication devices, printing devices, device readers, displays, and keyboards, and the allocation of memory and processor to computing resources in a safe and stable manner. Examples – Windows XP, Linux, and Mac OS X. Programming software Programming software usually provides tools to assist the programmer in writing computer programs and software that uses different programming languages ​​in a more convenient way. These tools include: compilers Teabaggers Interpreters Linkers Text editors An integrated development environment (IDE) is a single application that attempts to handle all of these functions. Application software Application software enables users to accomplish one or more specific (directly related to computer development) tasks. Typical applications include: Industrial Automation Business software Video games Microwave Chemistry and Solid State Physics Software Communications (ie the Website and all Content); Databases Educational software (these are now gaining popularity in India) Medical software Military software Molecular modeling software Image editing Video editing Spreadsheet Counterfeit software Word processing Decision making software 3D graphics software Accounting software Payroll software There are application software for a wide range of topics and influence them. Construction of Software Topics Users view these differently than programmers. In modern general-purpose computers (as opposed to embedded systems, analog computers, and supercomputers), users see three layers of software: platform, application, and user software that perform different tasks: . Platform Software: A platform includes software, device drivers, an operating platform, and typically a graphical user interface, which collectively enables the user to interact with the computer and its peripherals (connected devices). The site software comes bundled with the computer. You have the ability to change site software as you normally would on a PC. Application Software: When thinking of software, most users think of application software or applications. Typical examples are office suites and video games. Application software is always purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes apps come bundled with a computer, but that doesn't change the fact that they work as individual apps. Applications are usually programs that are separate from the operating system, although they are designed for specific platforms. Most users think of binaries, databases, and other ""system software"" as applications. User-written software: An end-user developer designs systems to meet the user's specific needs. User software includes spreadsheet templates, word processors [Platform software: A platform includes software, device drivers, an operating system, and typically a graphical user interface, all of which allow the user to interact with the computer and its peripherals (integrated device). The Site Software comes bundled with the system. You are given the ability to replace the site software on a PC. Email splitters are also a type of user software. Users develop this software themselves and oversee how advanced it is. Depending on how well user-written software is integrated into automated application packages, many users may not know the difference between native packages and those added by collaborators. Documentation Most software has software documentation so that the end user understands what a program does and how to use it. Software without clear documentation can be difficult to use – especially when it's highly specialized and complex software like Photoshop or AutoCAD. There may also be developer documentation, which may be notes and/or separate documents detailing how these programs work and how they can be improved. The fact that a library is an executable is not always complete enough for direct implementation. Software libraries contain functions and sets of functions that can be integrated with other applications. Many standard software libraries and applications, including operating platforms, are distributed within their own libraries. Software standards are needed because software is designed in different programming languages, operating platforms, and operating environments so that different software can understand each other and exchange information. For example, if an email is sent from Microsoft Outlook it should be read by Yahoo!Mail and vice versa. Implementation Computer software is uploaded ""into the computer's storage"" (hard disk, memory, or RAM). Once the software is loaded the computer acquires the ability to execute the software. It carries instructions from the application software through the system software to the hardware that finally receives the machine code. Each instruction causes the computer to perform an action—including moving data, performing calculations, or changing the flow of control of instructions. Data movement is the transfer of data from one location in memory to another. Sometimes it is also associated with transferring data from memory to registers to make data access on the CPU more efficient. Moving data can be costly, especially for large volumes. Therefore, this is sometimes avoided by using ""pointers"" instead of data. Calculations also include simple operations such as incrementing the value of variable data elements. More complex computations may involve multiple functions and data elements interacting in an integrated manner. Quality and Reliability Software quality is important, especially for business and system software such as Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. A software bug (if it contains a bug) can destroy and corrupt one's work and do unexpected things. Mistakes and errors are called ""bugs"". Many bugs are discovered and cleared (debugged) through software testing. However, software testing rarely—if ever—clears every page; Some programmers say that ""every program is incomplete without at least one page"" (Lupersky's rule). All major companies, such as Microsoft, Novell, and Sun Microsystems, have software testing departments with the specific goal of testing. Software is tested through unit testing, regression testing, and other methods, which can be done manually or, more commonly, automatically, as the code being tested can be large. NASA, for example, has very strict software testing procedures for many operating platforms and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations are interoperable and identified through command programs called software. This allows many users working at NASA to evaluate operational systems as a whole. Programs that include command software combine hardware engineering and system functions to make implementation much easier. License A license to software gives the user the right to use that software in the licensed environment. Some software comes with a license when purchased from a store or comes with an OEM license when it comes with hardware. Other software comes with a free software license that gives the recipient rights to develop and distribute the software. Software also comes in the form of freeware or shareware. Copyrights Software may be proprietary; However, there are conflicting views in the software industry regarding software patents. The paradox of software patents is that a particular process or technique contained in a piece of software cannot be imitated by others and is considered intellectual property and patent infringement depending on its severity. Design and Implementation The design and implementation of software depends on the complexity of the software. For example, the design and development of Microsoft Word software is much more time-consuming than Microsoft Notepad because the functions involved in each are different. Software is typically designed and developed (coding/writing/programming) in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IMAX, and Microsoft Visual Studio, which can facilitate this process and program compilation. As mentioned in various sections, software is built on existing software and application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide embedded software such as GTK+, JavaBeans, or Swing. Libraries (APIs) are categorized for different purposes. For example, the JavaBeans library is used to design enterprise applications, the Windows Forms library is used to design a graphical user interface (GUI) like Microsoft Word, and the Windows Communication Foundation is used to create Web services. Intrinsic computer programming concepts such as QuickChart, HashTable, Array, and Binary Tree can be useful for developing software. When a program is designed it relies on the API. For example if a user is designing a Microsoft Windows desktop application he can use the .NET Windows Forms library to create that desktop application and he will call its API as follows form1.Close() and form1.Show() [5] to open and close the application and it should have Also writes additional functions. Without these APIs the programmer would have to write these APIs automatically. Companies such as Sun Microsystems, Novell, and Microsoft provide their own APIs, so many applications are written using proprietary software libraries that contain many APIs within themselves. Software with special economic characteristics has a form, creation, and distribution that differs from other economic goods.[6][7] Being called a software developer, programmer, software engineer, software developer or code monkey all mean the same thing. Organizations and Organizations Software has its own industry called the software industry and it is made up of various companies and individuals who develop software and as a result has provided many software companies and programmers in the world. Such software companies and individuals specialize in specific fields as software is increasingly being used in various fields such as finance, search, mathematics, aerospace, sports and mining. For example, electronic arts mainly produce video games. Selling software is also a lucrative industry. For example, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, was the world's richest man in 2009 due to sales of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office software programs. Similarly, Larry Ellison became rich through his Oracle database software. There are also non-profit software organizations such as the Free Software Movement, QNU, and Mozilla Firefox. There are software standards organizations such as W3C, IETF, and others such as XML, HTML, MySQL, or File Transfer Protocol. Some of the well known software companies are Microsoft, Oracle, Novell, SAP, Symantec, Adobe Systems and Corel.

"An elephant is a herbivorous (leaf-eating) mammal. It is the largest of all land animals. It is also very long-lived (~70 years). It is the longest living land animal besides humans. Elephants are very strong. The beasts of prey and the highest in the food hierarchy of wild animals, the lion (Arima), the tiger, etc., are unapproachable in strength. Lions gang up and kill a tired or young elephant that might come alone. However, such incidents are very rare. Elephants live in families. Also, they have high memory capacity. Only three elephants remain in the world today. They are African bush elephants, African forest elephants and Asian elephants. There are significant differences between them. Generally, all elephants live up to about 70 years. A male elephant is called Kaliru. A female elephant is called Bd. A baby elephant is called a calf or cub. The sound made by an elephant is called bellowing. Elephant Species African elephants are larger in stature than Asian elephants. They have large ear lobes. Both male and female African elephants have tusks. However, ivory is rarely found in Asian female elephants. The back of African elephants curves slightly inwards behind the head and is flat without raised forehead ridges. These have two petals at the apex of the thallus. But the front feet have four or five claws and the hind feet have three claws. Asian elephants have slightly raised backs. There are two ridges on the forehead and small ear lobes. There is only one petal at the apex of the thallus (upper margin). The front feet have five claws and the hind feet have four claws. Food and Habitat Elephants are herbivores or herbivores. They like to eat bamboo and sugarcane. They spend 16 hours a day gathering food. Also, their digestive capacity is very slow. Therefore, 40 percent of these foods are digested. Hence, they tend to consume a lot of food. Well-grown elephants consume about 140 to 270 kg of food per day. Physique Male elephants are typically 3 meters tall and weigh 6000 kilograms. Elephant skin is very thick. There will be a thickness of about 3 cm. However, it will be slow. Thus, mosquitoes etc. will also bite. An elephant has four strong legs. Despite its bulky body, the elephant can climb and descend hills and steep places efficiently. The proverb ""the foot of an elephant glides"" is a reference to the elephant's ability to walk in long ups and downs. Trunk The special feature of an elephant is its trunk. It is best seen only in elephants. Although a few animals have a slightly elongated frontal nose (like the proboscis monkey), there are no animals with long trunk-like limbs. The trunk is made up of a total of 40,000 muscles. It is flexible in all directions. At the tip of the trunk are the nostrils through which the elephant breathes, and tiny, highly sensitive fingertips.[1] The trunk can lift anything from a small stick to a large tree. They usually help in picking up food and drinking water. The elephant repels attacks from hostile animals with its trunk. Because the neck is short the prominence of the trunk is great. Tusk Elephants have two tusks. These are called elephant lines. This elephant coat is present only in male elephants (Kalurukku) in Asiatic Indian elephants and not in female elephants (Pitukku). But African wild elephants, both male and female, have a stripe (both male and female). The elephants living in Sumatra and Borneo, the elephants of Sri Lanka, are bisexual (Kaliru, Pd) and often have an elephant line. An elephant's tusk is an extension of an elephant's molars. Hence these are also called elephant's tusks or tusks (tusks and tusks mean teeth). Tusks can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet). And they can weigh up to 90 kilograms. These tusks are also used for trade. In March 2015, Ethiopia burned six tons of ivory taken from several elephants.[2] Leather Elephant skin is very thick. Thick skin is found in most parts of the body. The skin is about two and a half centimeters thick. However, the skin around its mouth and inside the ear is thin. Asian elephants generally have more hair on their skin than African elephants. Elephants usually smear mud or dirt all over their bodies. This is an important characteristic of elephant society. It helps to protect the skin of the elephant from the sun's heat and radiation. Although the elephant's skin is thick, it is very sensitive. This is why elephants spit mud or dirt after bathing. Legs They have strong legs to support the elephant's large body. They don't need much muscle power to stand because of their straight legs and wide feet. So they can stand for a long time without resting. African elephants often do not sit unless they are sick or injured. But Asian elephants rest often. The elephant has got a broad round foot (foot). The African elephant has three tusks (claws) on its hind legs and four on its front legs. The Asian elephant has four tusks on the hind legs and five on the front legs. Elephants can swim and climb well. These cannot be jumped. Ears Elephants have very large broad lobed ears. They play an important role in maintaining the elephant's body temperature. Elephant's ears are full of blood vessels. The ambient air cools down as the heated blood flows into the ears. Then it goes into the body and lowers the temperature. Due to blood circulation, this process is continuous and the temperature is kept under control. This is why elephants are always seen moving their ears. The upper margin of a grown elephant's ear is folded outward in the Asian elephant, and curled inward in the African elephant.[3] Cognition The elephant's brain is the largest of all land animals. It weighs a little over five kilograms. Elephants have good memory. After elephants and dolphins, elephants are considered to be the most intelligent animals. Elephants are said to be second to humans in intelligence. Elephant brains are also superior in structure and technique. They also learn to use tools. Elephants are generally compassionate.[4] Sensory Sense Elephants have excellent hearing and sense of smell. The elephant's eye is slightly myopic. Thus, an elephant relies on its keen sense of hearing and subtle sense of smell rather than its sight.[5] Their trunks are also sensitive. Not only their ears but also their trunks are capable of sensing vibrations. Their feet are capable of sensing very low frequency sound waves. Social Life The social life of greens is different from the life of pits. Embryos live with their mother's group until they reach puberty, then mostly alone. But the Bds live as a well-knit family of mother, sister and daughter. Adolescence is also observed during the breeding season. Self-awareness Elephants are self-aware. It is established by glass testing. Elephants recognize themselves when placed in front of a mirror. This ability has so far only been found in baboons, some monkeys, and dolphins. A study conducted among domesticated elephants in Zimbabwe suggests that elephants have the ability to understand a person's pointing.[6] A breeding elephant has a gestation period of 22 months. This is the longest gestation period in mammals. They usually give birth to only one calf. Twins are very rare. A newborn baby elephant weighs between 90 – 115 kilograms. Before, during, and after calving, the elephant is greatly assisted by the presence of other adult elephants. From birth, the calf is raised by the herd. Threats Poaching A major threat to elephants is poaching. Elephants are hunted for their tusks. Large, long-lived and slow-breeding elephants, over-hunting has a major impact. They are large and cannot be hidden easily. Each elephant takes years to grow and breed. Each elephant needs an average of 140 kilograms (300 pounds) of leaves per day. Due to the destruction of large animals like tigers and lions, small herbivores competing for elephants' food are multiplying and destroying plants, making it difficult for elephants to get food. Elephants are rarely killed for food by animals other than humans. Habitat Shrinkage Another important threat is the destruction of elephant habitats. Humans are destroying elephant habitats for agricultural expansion. This creates conflicts between the interests of humans and the interests of elephants. For example, elephants enter new agricultural settlements, destroying crops and endangering lives of people. An average of 150 elephants and 100 humans die in Sri Lanka every year due to such conflicts. Deforestation also reduces the habitat of elephants. Habitat loss is said to be the primary reason for the extinction of Asian elephants. Elephants require large areas of forest to survive. Because elephants enter an area in droves and destroy trees and plant vines. Then they go somewhere else. Thus the destroyed forests go to new places and re-grow and come back to the same place and get food. As habitats shrink, food runs out very quickly.[7] Humans and Elephants As elephants are killed legally and against the law by humans, there are unintended consequences for elephants' physiology. Ivory poachers in Africa hunt elephants with large tusks, leaving the remaining elephants with small tusks or no tusks. Newly born cubs are also more likely to be born with these, leading to the addition of tuskless genes in new generations, leading to the birth of large numbers of tuskless elephants. The number of such elephants has increased from 1% in 1930 to 30% in some areas. Edentulism was once a rare genetic mutation and is now becoming a common hereditary trait. Mortality Elephants can die of heart failure, heart attack, and cerebral hemorrhage.[8] Elephant in Sangam Literature In Tamil Sangam literature, the elephant is mentioned in more than 170 names. See in detail. Some of them are as follows; 1. Elephant, 2. Velam, 3. Kaliru, 4. Pliru, 5. Kalapam, 6. Matangam, 7. Kaima, 8. Umbal - , 9. Varanam, 10. Anjanavati, 11. Athi, 12.

"An automated teller machine or automated teller machine is a computerized machine that allows the customer to perform certain tasks such as depositing, withdrawing, and checking accounts. This tool mechanized and automated many of the tasks that were normally done by the teller in the bank. Generally, the customer will do their work by inserting an account card into the machine. This machine came into widespread use in the United Kingdom from 1967. ATM John Shepherd Barron (June 23 1925 – May 20 2010) from Scotland was the first to invent an automatic teller machine (ATM). The Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal for a husband to send his wife's ATM card.[1] Evidence Category: Instruments Category:Banking Category:Automation Category:Computer Science ",Who invented the automatic teller machine?,John Shepherd Barron,603
"An encyclopedia[1] is a collection of knowledge in written form. Encyclopaedias may be multidisciplinary, specialized to a particular field, or to a particular geographic area or ethnicity.[2] The information in the encyclopedia is organized alphabetically and by department. Alphabetical encyclopedias are the most commonly used.[3] Social Leadership Denis Diderot, who published an encyclopedia in French in the late 18th century, said the following about the encyclopedia: The purpose of an encyclopedia is to store and compile the vast knowledge of the world for the benefit of the people and to hand it down to the generations that follow us. This will prevent the work of previous centuries from becoming useless to future generations and will help our younger generation to be well educated and live happily. Also, before we die, this will be the charity we do for the mankind that will live in the future.—Diderot[4] Nature Today's encyclopedias evolved from 18th-century encyclopedias. Alphabets usually give words and their meanings. Also, sometimes the backgrounds of the words and other related information are included to a lesser extent. Even when the meaning of the term is given, users are not provided with information about its complete definition, specificity, scope of application, and how the term relates to the wider field of knowledge. Keeping the above requirements in mind, encyclopedias take up each topic and try to provide in-depth information about it and compile all the available knowledge in the field. Encyclopaedias also include maps, charts, appendices, and infographics. In the past, encyclopedias and encyclopedias were written by experts in the fields they covered. Four main elements define an encyclopedia. They are: Content, Boundary, Regulating Method, Formative Method. Encyclopedias can be generic. These contain articles on topics within each discipline (eg: Encyclopaedia Britannica). Encyclopaedias tend to focus only on topics that fall within a specific field. These are medical encyclopedias, philosophical encyclopedias and jurisprudential encyclopedias. The depth and breadth of the constructs covered will depend on the nature of their users. Encyclopaedias must be organized in a formal order if they are to be a valid source of evidence. In the past, printed encyclopedias were organized in one of two main ways. These are alphabetical system, hierarchical system of categories. The first method is the most commonly used method today. Especially public encyclopedias are organized in this way. Today's electronic media provide facilities for organizing content in multiple ways at the same time. Also, electronic media provide facilities such as search facilities and connectivity facilities that were never seen before. Nowadays, the development of multimedia and information technology has had a huge impact on the collection, verification, integration and disclosure of various types of information. Examples of new forms of encyclopedias are Everything2, Encarta, H2G2, Wikipedia, etc., which are designed for easy access to information. Some of the works labeled as akaramudhis actually resemble encyclopedias. Specially, there are special alphabets for specific fields like this. For example, Dictionary of the Middle Ages in English, Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Black's Law Dictionary. History Naturalis Historia (Naturalis Historia), a Latin work written by Pliny the Elder, a Roman statesman who lived in the first century AD, is the oldest encyclopedic work available today. He compiled a book with 37 chapters on natural history, art and architecture, medicine, geography, geology, etc. He states in his preface that he has compiled 20,000 notes from 2,000 different works written by 100 authors, including many from his own research. It was published in 77 AD. This particular structure is large and elaborate. It may have been a complete collection of all the sciences and arts related to nature. Pliny said: My topic is the natural world or life. A very underrated field. It is regrettable to use vulgar words or foreign barbarous words. Also, the path to this is not already paved by writers or anyone willing to go down this path. None of us has attempted this, nor has a single Greek dealt with all the branches of this subject alone. Although there were many similar older works, this is the only book that survived the Dark Ages. It was very popular during Roman times. Many stages of this were developed and spread throughout Europe. It was published in 1469 as one of the first classical period books to be printed. Since then it has been known as a reference book for information about the Roman period. Especially, it is known for fur art, fur technology, fur engineering, etc.; It was also a much sought after book for information related to fields like medicine, mineralogy, zoology, botany, geology etc. Early Middle Ages Saint Isidore of Seville, a great scholar, produced the first medieval encyclopedia, Etymologiae - 630 AD. In this he compiled information related to all the fields of knowledge, old and new, of his time. It consisted of 448 sections in 20 blocks. This collection is valuable not only for its uniqueness but also for the quotations from other authors and excerpts from their works. If he had not compiled this, information about many rare books would not be available today. The Encyclopaedia of Bartholomew Anglicanus in 1240 was the most widely read encyclopedia of the Middle Ages. However, in the later Middle Ages, around 1260, the encyclopedia by Vincent was said to contain 3 million words. The early Islamic and Persian anthologies of Muslim knowledge included many elaborate works and saw major developments in the fields known today as scientific method, historical method, and citation. By 960 AD, the Brethren of Purity from Pasura were engaged in the creation of the Brethren of Purity Encyclopaedia. Among these, Abu Bakr al-Razi's Encyclopaedia of Science, 270 books by Mu'tazilite al-Kindi, and Ibn China's Medical Encyclopaedia are notable. China The Four Great Books of Song, an encyclopedic work compiled during the beginning of the Song Dynasty in the 11th century, is a massive intellectual work of the time. The last of these contains 9.4 million Chinese characters in 1000 volumes. Many encyclopedic authors can be found throughout Chinese history. Among them were the scholar and statesman Shen Guo (1031–1095); Wang Chen (1290–1333), statesman, inventor, and agronomist; Notables include Chong Yinxiang (1587–1666). Yongle, a Chinese emperor of the Ming Dynasty, compiled an art encyclopedia called the Yongle Encyclopedia. Compiled in 1408, it is one of the largest encyclopedias in the world. It contains 11,000 handwritten volumes and 370 million Chinese characters. 17th – 19th centuries The modern idea of ​​a general purpose and widely used encyclopedia predates the 18th century encyclopedias. However, Chambers' Cyclopaedia or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (1728), Diderot and D'Alembert's Encyclopédie (1751), Encyclopaedia Britannica, Conversations-Lexikon were the first encyclopedias in the form of today. They were structured, with broad headings and in-depth explanations. The encyclopedia of the French Renaissance was based on the premise that it did not need to cover everything known to man, but only what was necessary. As what is necessary is decided on the basis of several criteria, encyclopedias of different sizes have emerged. The metrics were mostly based on morals. Encyclopaedists faced several problems with this approach. Such problems included how to decide what not to include, how to organize knowledge that could not be contained within the framework, how to handle newly discovered knowledge, and the impact it might have on the previous system. Sir Thomas Browne, a physician and philosopher from England, published an encyclopedia called Pseudodoxia Epidemica in 1646. He organized his encyclopedia in a hierarchical system known as the ""gradation of works"", which was widely used in the Renaissance. Accordingly, the topics were arranged from bottom to top in the order of Mineral, Vegetable, Animal, Man, Planets, Cosmos. Brown's collection saw five editions. Each edition was revised and new information was added. The last edition appeared in 1672. Found in the homes of educated Europeans in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, it was translated into many languages. It was John Harris who introduced the most familiar alphabetical arrangement system today. His work, published in 1704, was entitled Lexicon Technicum, or an English Alphabet of Arts and Sciences: Explaining the Arts, Not Only the Words Related to the Arts. (Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves). As mentioned in the title, the book contained not only terms related to arts and sciences but also explanations of arts and sciences. Sir Isaac Newton's only published work on chemistry is in the 1710 edition. It prioritized science as leadership. Its contents covered what was understood as ""science"" in the 18th century, as well as topics in the arts and fine arts. For example, there were up to 1200 pages on disciplinary topics like law, business, music etc. It can be considered more of an encyclopedia than an encyclopedia.

"The basic unit of time is the second or second, as determined by the International System of Units (SI). Its code and short code are as follows: Code: (English: s; Tamil: વ or સ્યાન or સ્ડ) Short code: (Abbreviated code: English: s; Tamil: વ).[1][2] Minutes are obtained when the hour is first divided into sixty divisions. The first division of the hour gives the minutes and the second division of the hour into sixty divisions gives the seconds or seconds. The second division is called 'Second' in English.[3] Cesium (atomic mass: 133) has a period of 9 192 631 770 periods of radiation when it transitions between two microscopic levels in atomic physics. This is called the second or second in the SI unit.[1][4] A second (or second) is the basic unit used to measure time.[5] 60 seconds = 1 minute (hour).[6] Definition History Early Civilizations: Early civilizations divided the day into smaller segments and gave separate names to the elements. But no one has formally used the word second or second for the fraction of a given time. BC In 2000 the Egyptians divided a day equally into twelve hours of day and twelve hours of night. Hence the degree of length of hours in days and nights also differed according to seasonal variations. The Hellenistic astronomers Hipparchus (c. 150 BC) and Ptolemy (c. 150) divided the hour into sixty parts (the number system under sexagesimal fractions). They used a mean hour (1/24 day), simple fractions of an hour (1/4, 2/3, etc.), and a time angle (1/360 day, or the equivalent of four modern minutes).[7] ] BC After 300 AD the Babylonians calculated a day using the following system of fractions of sixty. Each subsequent subsection is divided by sixty. That is, 1/60, 1/60, 1/60 is calculated as a power of sixty. Its accuracy is equal to 2 microseconds.[8] The Babylonians did not use hours. But a double duration of 120 modern minutes was used. A duration—estimated at four long minutes. A barleycorn lasts 3 1/3 modern seconds (modern Hebrew's calendar arc),[9] but is not subdivided into smaller units under the fractions of sixty. Based on subdivisions of the lunar cycle: Circa 1000, the Persian scholar al-Biruni used the Arabic system of second or second. He divides the time between the two avayadhas into weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and third and fourth afternoon Sundays.[10] In 1267, the medieval scientist Roger Bacon, in a Latin account, divided between the third and fourth full moons into hours (horae-horae), minutes (minuta-minuta), seconds (secunda-secunda), thirds (tertia-tertia). and defined the fourth (quarta-quarta) in a specific calendar.[11] Modern seconds or seconds are divided using decimal numbers as follows - the third code word (1⁄60th of a second) Other languages ​​also use the word seconds or seconds. Example: Polish (turcja-tercja) and Turkish (salise-salise). Based on mechanical clocks: In the late 16th century, the earliest clocks used to show seconds appeared. After the invention of mechanical clocks it became easy to measure seconds or seconds accurately. This is against the intended time shown by the sundial. In the Fremersdorf collection, a clock depicting Orpheus, a push clock with a second hand with a spiral bow, attracted the most attention. It started in 1560 and finished in 1570.[12]:417–418[13] In the third quarter of the 16th century, Taqi al-Din created a clock that showed every 1/5 minute.[14] In 1579, Jost Bürgi made a clock showing seconds for William of Hesse.[12]:105}} In 1581, Tycho Braghi made a restored clock. He used it in his astronomical observatories. They showed minutes and seconds. However, they are not accurate enough to predict seconds. In 1587, Tycho complained that his four clocks differed by four seconds more or less.[12]:104 In 1644, Marin Mersenne measured seconds using a pendulum 39.1 inches long (0.994). It worked with projected gravitational acceleration. He accurately calculated that the pendulum takes one second to move forward and one second to move backward.[15] In 1670, London clockmaker William Clement combined this second pendulum with Christian Icon's original pendulum clock.[16] From 1670 to 1680, Clement made several improvements to his clocks. In 1832, Carl Friedrich Gauss proposed the second as the basic unit of time in his millimeter-milligram-second standardized system of units. In 1862, the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) agreed that ""on scientific grounds, all calendars should use the second, the mean base unit of solar time"".[17] On the basis of part of a year: NPTs were described in Newcomb's Solar Motion Chart (1895), based on Earth's motion. Based on astronomical observations between 1750 and 1892, a formula for estimating the value of the sun's motion was developed.[18] In particular, the tables used for most of the 20th century were based on Newcomb's solar movement. (1900 to 1983). Also, Ernest William Brown's lunar tables were used from 1923 to 1983. Based on the Cesium Microwave Atomic Clock: After several years of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, England, and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Astronomy Station confirmed the relationship between the cesium atom's microwave transition frequency and astronomical period. .[19] In this, W. W. V. (WWV) used a common visual measurement method based on signals received from a radio station.[20] They found and confirmed that the astronomical period (ET), the second or second, the frequency of the selected cesium atom had the same magnitude of 9,192,631,770 ± 20 cycles.[19] (The SI second was already adopted. The SI second was slightly shorter than the second value of the mean solar period.[21][22]) Relativistically, the SI second value is defined as the exact time of the Earth's motion and rotation.[23] A proposed optical atomic clock based on: Ludlow et al Quote: Optical atomic clocks pose a challenge to atomic clocks operating in the microwave region today.[24] The National Research Council of Canada indicates that 2.5 × 10-11 is ""relatively uncertain"". Instead of an atomic clock based on an iodine (atomic weight 127) molecule, he advocated the use of a strontium (atomic weight 88) ion trap.[25] Uncertainties rival the NIST-F1 cesium atomic clock in the microwave region, which is estimated to average sixteen parts of a day to the power of ten in terms of frequency.[26][27] A second is defined as follows according to the exact position. A second is defined in terms of micro-energy differences caused by the magnetic field in the nucleus of a cesium-133 atom when it is in its ground state. A second is the duration of 192 631 770 oscillations between two very fine energy gaps in the ground state of a cesium-133 atom at a stationary temperature of 0 K (Kelvin). There are 3600 seconds in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So one second is equal to 24 seconds.

The title of the novel suggests many things, the murdered man's body is found in the Tenon Wing of the Lowry, laid out naked like Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting Vitruvian Man, with a hidden message written on the body and a pentagon drawn on his stomach with his own blood. The novel sparked widespread interest in speculation over the ages about the Holy Grail and Magdalene's role in Christian history. Christian sects condemned and banned the book as an attack on the Roman Catholic Church. It has also been criticized for its historical and scientific inaccuracies. The book is a bestseller with over 80 million copies sold worldwide and has been translated into 44 languages. Blending the genres of detective, horror and paradoxical fiction, it is Brown's second novel to be published as Robert Langdon, his first being the 2000 novel Angels & Demons. In November 2004, Random House released a special illustrated edition with 160 illustrations. In 2006, a film adaptation was also released by Sony's Columbia Pictures. Synopsis The book follows the efforts of Robert Langdon, a professor of religious symbolism at Harvard University, to find the killer of Jacques Souvenir, a famous museum curator at the Louvre Museum in Paris. A hidden void was also found near his body. Chanier's granddaughter, Sophie Nieuw and Langdon, discover impossible puzzles and discover the hidden codes hidden in Leonardo da Vinci's artworks. Solving the mystery requires solving a series of challenging trivia puzzles, including anagrams and number puzzles. The overall solution is found to be most closely related to the Holy Grail and the mystery society known as the Priory of Zion and the Knights Templars. A Roman Catholic movement called Opus Dei also comes into the story. Details The story begins with the (unbeknownst to anyone at the time) murder of Jacques Chanier, the Priory of Sion's main abbot, murdered by Silas (a replacement known only as The Teacher) and the location of the ""Keystone"", a theme that guides the Holy Grail. The police call in Robert Langdon, who has arrived in Paris to accompany him to the scene of the murder, to help trace the marks left by Chanier on and near his body. The lead detective, Biju Bach, suspects Langdon to be the main culprit of the murder. As a police detective, Sophie Nieveau confides in Langdon when he arrives at the scene of a murder. Jacques Chaunier was Nieveau's grandfather. On a surprise trip to their home in Normandy, Nieuwe, on vacation from boarding school, discovers that he is involved in a pagan sex ritual known as hieros camos. Till then both are united. (What he feels is mentioned and mentioned several times throughout the story, but no one is told what he saw until he tells Robert near the end of the story). Langdon and Niveu discover a hidden void near Chanier's body. These secrets lead to a second set of secrets. Discovering her grandfather's secrets, Nivue sees a painting with a secret key, and behind the key is the address and symbols of the Priory of Zion. Working together, Langdon and Niveu outwit the police and escape the scene to discover the secret of the key. Unlocks the safe deposit box in the Paris branch of the depository bank in Zurich. The first eight digits of Chanier's bank account number represent a 10-digit Fibonacci number: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 Inside the safe deposit box they find a keystone to a large cryptex, a scroll discovered by Leonardo da Vinci to transmit secret messages. To open it you need to arrange the matching of rotating tools in the right order. If the cryptex is forced open, a tube of vinegar inside breaks and leaks out, destroying the message written on the papyrus. The rosewood box containing the large cryptex also contained a match containing the cryptex's secrets, set in a backwards font similar to what was written in Leonardo's notes. Chanier's terms at gunpoint to Silas were a blatant lie, namely that the keystone was buried in the shrine of St. Sulpice and that it was near the four-pointed tower closest to the ancient ""rose-line"" (the old prime meridian that passed through Paris before Greenwich was reorganized). The message near the four-pointed tower was said to be a reference to the Book of Job (38:11a), which means, ""Just this come, do not pass."" (KJV) As Silas reads this, he feels deceived. Still being chased by the police, Langdon and Niiyu take the keystone and go to Sir Lee Deiping (an expert on the Holy Grail and Langdon's friend). Flying in Deeping's private plane, they discover how to open the cryptex, but the larger cryptex contains a second, smaller cryptex, which reveals a second puzzle containing its relevance. The riddle tells us to find the constellation on the tomb of ""a Pope's guard intervening"", which does not represent a historical medieval warrior, but the tomb of Sir Isaac Newton, buried in Westminster Abbey, which is credited with landing by Alexander Pope (A. Pope). It is later revealed that the teacher who sent Silas to kill Deeping Jacques Sr. had information regarding the identities of the leaders of the Priory of Zion, and that he had hired Silas to spy on their offices and kill them. Remy is his coordinator. It was Deeping who contacted Bishop Aringarosa to find the Grail while hiding his identity and helped finance the project. Aringarosa has no intention of giving up the Grail, but uses Opus Dei's solution to find it. Deeping believes that the Priory of Zion has broken its commitment to reveal the secret of the Grail to the world at the appointed time. He plans to steal the documents of the Grail and reveal them to the world himself. He is the one who informs Silas that Langdon and Sophie Nieuwe are at his house. He didn't take the keystone from them because he didn't want to reveal his identity. He asks Sylas to pick up the keystone to keep in his house, but he himself puts Sylas' interest on hold as he needs Langdon and Sophie's help to find the cryptex code. In the aftermath, the police arrive to search the house, finding Langton using the tracking device he stole while escaping from the bank. Deeping takes Nieuwe and Langdon to London's Temple Church, knowing there is no way forward, and attempts to steal the keystone from Remy, thereby not revealing his true role to Langdon and Nieuwe. To destroy all traces of his activities, Deeping kills Remy by giving Remy a powder of peanuts mixed with cognac, a French drug, knowing that he has a severe allergy to peanuts. So Remy dies of shock to the backup mutant. Deeping informs the police that Silas is missing from Opus Dei's London headquarters, concealing his identity. Suspicious of his quarrel with Deeping at Westminster Abbey, Langdon secretly disassembles the second cryptex and removes its contents before Deeping destroys the former. While begging in vain to tell him about the contents of the second cryptex and the second location of the Grail, Deeping was arrested and taken away. After Bishop Aringarosa confides his mistake and learns that Niveu and Langdon are innocent, Besu backs. Fake cancels the warrants for Nieuw and Langdon's arrest. Aringarosa is inadvertently shot by Silas while on the run from the police outside Opus Dei's London headquarters. Realizing the grave mistake of impersonating him, Aringarosa tells Besu Fake to give the bonds in his box to the families of the murdered leaders of the Priory of Sion. Silas dies from his mortal wounds. Although the Grail was once buried in the ground under the Star of David (the two intersecting triangles of the ""knife"" and the bowl,"" i.e., male and female symbols), the final message on the second keystone does not refer to Roslyn Chapel. Roslyn Chapel's docent is Sophie's long-lost brother. Sophie was told that as a child she was killed in a car accident with her parents and grandmother. Roslyn Chappell's caretaker is Marie Chavell, Sophie's long-lost grandmother, Jacques Chanier's wife. She was the woman who had sex with Jacques Chanier. Sophie is also said to be a descendant of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid all traces of him to protect against possible threats to his life. Even though all four leaders of the Priory of Zion are dead, the secret is still preserved because there are contingency plans that keep the movement and its secrecy intact. The real meaning of the final message is that the Grail is now buried behind the small pyramid (ie, the masculine symbol ""blade""), directly below Lowry's inverted glass pyramid (ie, the ""bowl""), a feminine symbol, which Langdon and Sophie first escaped from Besu Fake by breaking. It is "" Close to the ""Rose Line"", equivalent to ""Roslin"". Langdon discovers the final puzzle to the riddle of the last pages of the book, but does not seek to tell anyone. See La Pyramide Inversée for further discussion. Characters These are the primary characters who can drive the plot. Some names contain confusions, anagrams, or even hidden secrets: Robert Langdon Jacques Saunier Sophie Nieuw Pesu Fake Silas Manuel Oringarosa Andriy Vernutt Lee Deeping Remy Legalutec Jerome Collett Marie Chaval Saint-Clair Pamela is bad Le Dibing explains to Sophie Nieuw in the novel The Secret of the Holy Grail that in Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the ""Last Supper"" it is Mary Magdalene, not the apostle John, who is to the right of Jesus. In the novel, Magdalena, the wife of Jesus Christ, was pregnant with his child when Jesus was crucified. Lee Teabing says that the absence of the chalice in Leonardo's drawing was attributed to Mary Magdalene and that he knew that the Holy Grail was indeed the child carried by Mary containing the blood of Jesus. Lee Teabing further elaborates on this, saying that this matter supports the letter form ""V"", meaning that the symbol ""V"" between Jesus and Mary represents the sacred feminine. The apostle John is missing from the map only to be referred to by Jesus' beloved disciple, John, to mark Mary Magdalene. The book notes that the use of colors for their clothing is also reversed: Jesus wears a red robe with royal blue trim; John/Mary wears a royal blue robe with a red hem — symbolizing the union of the two halves of the marriage. According to the novel, the Priory of Zion holds the secrets of the Holy Grail: The Holy Grail is not a physical cup, it is Mary Magdalene who carries Christ's bloodline. The Old French pronunciation of the Holy Grail is San Grail, which means it sounds like Sang Real, which means ""royal blood"" in Old French. The Grail Pedestal contains documents to test bloodline, including the actual bones of Mary Magdalene. The Grail pedestal of Mary Magdalene is kept in a secret crypt at the Priory of Sion, possibly even behind the Rosslyn Chapel. The church has hidden the truth about Mary Magdalene and Jesus' bloodline for 2000 years. This is because they fear the power of the Holy Feminine because it would contradict the primacy of St. Peter as an apostle. Mary Magdalene was of the royal line (through the tribe of Benjamin in the Jewish dynasty) and was the wife of Jesus in the line of David. That she was an adulterer was a slanderous claim invented by the Church to cover up their true relationship. She was pregnant at the time of the crucifixion. After his crucifixion, he went to Gaul and took refuge with the Jews of Marseilles. He had a daughter Sarah. It was the offspring of Jesus and Mary Magdalene that became the Merovingian Empire of France. The only secret contained in those documents was that it existed when Jerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099 (see Empire of Jerusalem). The Tanpriary of Zion and the Knights Templar were appointed to keep the secret. The connection between Leonardo da Vinci's work and the secret of the Grail is given in the novel as follows: Leonardo was a member of the Priory of Sion, so he knew the secret of the Grail. The secret is revealed in The Last Supper, which can be seen from the fact that no cups are placed on the table. The figure seated next to Christ is not a man but a woman, his wife Mary Magdalene. Many of the creations of the work came from a later transformation and were meant to rebuke her feminine qualities. The Mona Lisa's changing form represents the holy union between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. The pairing of masculine and feminine universal powers was a major threat to the growing dominance of the Church. The name Mona Lisa itself is an anagram of ""Amon Lisa"", a reference to the ancient Egyptian patriarchs (Amun and Isis). Various writers also doubt the possibility of Jesus being the Father. He had at least three children, a daughter named Tamar, born before the crucifixion, and Jesus had two sons (both Jesus Justus and Josephus, according to the New Testament, were born after the resurrection. Although their names also appear in the common culture of conspiracy writers, twenty years earlier, when the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail were written, These names are not mentioned. He is also the first of the ""Fisher King"", the grandfather of the Josephs, the royal family at the center of The Da Vinci Code. Although the Grail's romances seem to record very few offspring, the fathers continued to have children in their 40s. Reception Brown's novel became a huge success in 2004, surpassed only by JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.[1] Book Sense won the 2004 Book of the Year Award in the Adult Novel category. It spawned many favorable reviews and similar pamphlets in The New York Times, Beebe, and The Washington Post. In addition, The Da Vinci Code inspired many similar novels, including Raymond Corrie's The Last Templar and Steve Perry's The Templar Legacy. In a 2008 survey of 15,000 Australian readers, it came fourth on a list of the 101 greatest books ever written.[2] The book was not generally well received by critics, although it received numerous positive reviews for its literary value and the way it portrayed history. It has been heavily criticized for its writing and historical accuracy in The New Yorker,[3] The New York Times,[4] and Salon.com,[5] and others. Criticism The book was criticized when it was first published for its inaccurate description of central concepts of Christianity, history of the Catholic Church, references to European art, history and art. The book received mostly positive reviews from the Catholic and other Christian communities. Many critics suggested that Brown should have done more research before publishing this book. On February 22, 2004, the New York Times published an article by author Laura Miller entitled ""The Last Word: The Da Vinci Khan"".[4] Da Vinci was criticized at various points by Summer Miller, who called the book ""based on a wretched hoax"", ""stupidly graded"" and ""fake"", and that the book relied heavily on [[Pierre Blandard's[]] fables (Prior before Blandard wrote it). (There is no such thing as Of Zion) who was arrested in 1953 after being accused of committing similar frauds. Critics charged that Brown's writing was a fictionalized history. For example, Marcia Ford wrote: Regardless of whether you agree with Brown's conclusions, it's clear that his history is largely fanciful, which means he and his publisher have violated a long-held if unspoken agreement with the reader: Fiction that purports to present historical facts should be researched as carefully as a nonfiction book would be.[6] By Richard Abens: The most flagrant aspect… is not that Dan Brown disagrees with Christianity but that he utterly warps it in order to disagree with it … to the point of completely rewriting a vast number of historical events. And making the matter worse has been Brown's willingness to pass off his distortions as ‘facts' with which innumerable scholars and historians agree.[6] ""The Priory of Sion — a European secret society — formed in 1099 was a real movement,"" Dan Brown notes in the book. The Priory of Sion is Mr. It's a hoax created by Pierre Plantard in 1956. Although its author insists that the ""artwork, architecture, documents ... and secret rituals"" mentioned in the novel are all accurate, the book has met with opposition from all the respective fields of scholarship. Numerous books were published explaining why it was difficult to justify the accuracy of any reference, while at the same time there were two lawsuits alleging plagiarism in The Da Vinci Code. In February 2006, the first case of copyright infringement was filed in a British court by the authors of the book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, in which the fictional depiction of Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus of Nazareth and the mother of his child appeared in the work of Dan Brown. A second case was filed in August of the same year in the United States by Jack Dunn, author of The Vatican Boys, and has yet to be adjudicated. As a third author, Lewis Perdue's two novels, The Da Vinci Legacy, first published in 1983, and Daughter of God, first published in 2000, have been plagiarized by Brown. He tried to block the distribution of this book and film. However, Judge George Daniels of the United States District Court of New York reprimanded Perdue in 2005, noting that ""no reasonable average observer would agree that The Da Vinci Code is similar to Daughter of the Wild"" and that there are only a few casually similar elements or unguarded ideas in general.[7] Perdue appealed the first decision to the US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed Mr. Perdue's arguments as ""improper"".[8] Dan Brown explains the truth and corrects many of the contradictions himself through his website: any ancient stories discussed by fictional characters are not reported on ""The Fact"" page. The onus is on the reader to interpret the ideas"".[9] It states that ""these real elements are explained and discussed by fictional characters"", ""I believe that some of the theories expounded by these characters are excellent"" and ""I find it important to ignore the mystery behind The Da Vinci Code while it is well documented. It is also said that there is"". It is also clear why confusion continues as to what is actually given in the book. Brown's initial claims about the accuracy of his book's historical information were somewhat harsh. In 2003, while promoting his novel, he was asked in interviews which parts of the story in his novel actually happened. To which he replied ""Of course all of them"". In a 2003 interview with CNN's Martin Savage, he was asked how much truth there was in its historical background. To which he said, ""99% true ... the background is all true."" When Elizabeth Vargas was asked on an ABC News special what would have happened if the book had been written differently as a non-fiction book, she replied, ""I don't think so"".[10] Brown has avoided interviews more recently, and has been circumspect in some of his public statements about the accuracy of his claims. He never retreated from any of his previous comments, except for departmental criticisms against his claims about the accuracy of the novel. In 2005, UK TV personality Tony Robinson edited and proselytized a counter-narrative with Don Brown's key arguments, along with those of Boycont, Leigh, and Lincoln, under the title ""The Real Da Vinci Code"", screened on Channel 4 British TV. The show aired with lengthy interviews with many of the main characters in The Da Vinci Code, which Brown presented as ""the real truth"". Arnaud de Sade's son, Gérard de Sade, specifically attributed the existence of the Priory de Sion together with his father and Plantard to the doctrine of the lineage of Jesus - at which point Arnaud de Sion noted, ""Frankly, it's a flip"". At the event, serious doubt was cast on the connection between Roslyn Chapel and the Grail and the myth of the presence of Mary Magdalene in France. Portrayal of Early Christianity Da Vinci Summers The Roman Emperor Constantine suppressed Gnosticism for portraying Jesus as a pure man. A discussion of the novel follows.[11] Constantine wanted to make Christianity the sole religion of the Roman Empire. He thought that Christianity would suit the pagans only if they were shown as an incarnation of a god like the pagan leaders. According to the Gnostic Gospels Jesus was only a fully human prophet, not an incarnation of God. So to change the image of Jesus, Constantine destroyed the Gnostic Gospels and disseminated the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which depict Jesus as divine or semi-divine. Indeed, Gnosticism did not portray Jesus as fully human.[12] Some Gnostic writings show Jesus conversing with his disciples in fully human form, including the Gospel of Mary, an example, but the common Gnostic conception of Jesus is not clearly given. Many Gnostic writings present Christ as pure divinity and claim that the human body is a complete illusion (see Tostism).[13] Some Gnostic sects viewed Christ as such because they considered the spirit to be an evil force, and therefore believed that a divine force could not be embodied in a human body.[14] The Da Vinci Code also depicts the resolution of the Nicene Creed, whereby the full human and divine views of Christ were considered a close loop, while many writers opposed it.[15][16] Literary Criticism The novel received widespread criticism in literary circles for its lack of artistic or literary merit, and for its stereotypical portrayal of British and French characters. Salman Rushdie said during a speech, ""Don't even get me started on 'The Da Vinci Summer', a bad novel that gives bad novels a bad name"".[17] Stephen Fry has described Brown's writings as ""total sewage"" and ""the rotten sap of depravity"". On June 14, 2006, during a live broadcast chat, he made it clear that ""I hate all these books about the Holy Grail and the Masons and the conspiracy and the total collapse of the Catholic Church. I mean, there's a lot of interesting and wonderful things in art and history. It's tempting to think about the worst of the past."" [18] To feel foolishly exalted is to act as the dullest worst of mankind.[18] In a 2005 lecture at the University of Maine, bestselling author Stephen King put Dan Brown's book ""Jokes for the John"" on equal footing, describing such literature as ""the intellectual equivalent of craft macaroni and cheese"".[19] The New York Times reviewed the film based on the book and called it ""Don Brown's best-selling novel about how not to write an English word"".[20] Described as ""unspeakable trash"" and ""distorted style"".[3] Linguist Geoffrey Pullum at LanguageLogg and others have written several critical posts about Dan Brown's writing, calling him one of the ""worst essayists in literary history"" and that Brown's ""writing is not only bad; it can be astonishing, confusing, thoughtless, almost ill-conceived."" . Roger Ebert described it as a ""boiler pot written with a bit of flair and style"" and described it as ""providing a compelling storyline"".[21] Parodies 2005 Adam Roberts parodied the book as The Wa Tincy God and Toby Clements as The Aussie Spumand Code. In late 2005, the Australian television series Gad & Kim was parodied in a television movie called Da Gad and Kim Code. 2006 Da Vinci's summer was parodied in the BBC show Dead Ringers under the name Da Ralph Harris Code. A popular South African political cartoonist, Shapiro published a collection of his cartoons titled Da Zuma Code, which parodies former Vice President Jacob Zuma. 2007 The book was parodied in the South Park episode ""Fundastic Easter Special"" and Robert Rankin's novel {2}The Da-da-di-da-da code. The characters of Lucy and Silas were parodied in Epic Movie. The first scene of the film is set in a parody of Sophie Nieuve in a museum, as Silas chases the orphaned Lucy at the beginning of The Da Vinci Code. Silas speaks in Latin throughout the film. Translations of his speech are incorrect due to parody (Edu Silas saying ""What do you brat?"" to Aslo is translated in the film as ""I'm Rick James, bitch!""). Szybir Jana Matejki (Jane Matejko's Cypher) is a Polish parody narrated by Dariusz Rykos. The series Co(s)mixna Butryna: Szybir Jana Matejko II (Ka[s]mic Door Frame: Zane Matejko's Cyber ​​II ) was released in 2008. Inspector Josef Swinty, who tries to solve humanity's greatest mystery, plays the main character as the Piast Empire-in-charge (Najwiecza Dazamnica Ludzkoski). The book was parodied in the American Tate episode Black Mystery Man. The paradoxical truth that Stan seeks is that Mary Todd Lincoln was created by Peanut Butter, not George Washington Carver. 2008 In 2008, ""The Number One Code"" was set as a fictional film trailer based on a recurring drawing in the scene when its second series parodied That Mitchell and Webb Look. In March 2008, Irish blogger Twentie Major[22] included parody elements in her first book, The Order of the Phoenix Park[23]. The novel forms part of a search for alternative religious history whose appeals and implications. Its primary source book is The Templar Revelation by Lynn Bignett and Clive Prince, and Margaret Starbird's books on the court case are listed. An earlier novel had already used the concept of a Jesus lineage: The Dreamer of the Vine, published in 1980 by Liz Greene (then Richard Levy's sister and friend of Michael Boykind). The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (apparently named among many in its 60th chapter) was noted by Dan Brown as not being the subject of his original research. Acknowledging the above books as sources of inspiration, Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code goes beyond the main premise of its plot, namely: the kings of Merovingian France were descended from Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. In reference to Richard Ley and Michael Boykent (the two authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail), Brown names the main Grail expert in her story ""Lee Deeping"" (an anagram of ""Boykent Ley""). Brown confirmed this during the court case. In response to a question about Lincoln being mentioned, he explained that he had no idea Lincoln had such an ailment and that it was mentioned randomly, as the character Lee Teibing was suffering from medical problems that left him with a severe limp. Michael Boykant and Richard Ley lost before the Court of Appeal before losing in the High Court on 12 July 2006.[24][25] In the wake of the case, the publicity went a long way towards boosting UK sales of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.[26] Some notable similarities also occurred in the 1996 video game Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars. Publication details The book was originally translated into more than 40 languages.[27] Alternative formats are also included, including audio cassette, CD, and e-book. Most recently, a trade paperback edition was released in March 2006 to accompany the film.

On March 28, 2006, Anchor Books published 5 million paperback copies of the book, and Broadway Books published 200,000 paperback copies of The Da Vinci Code Special Illustrated Edition. On May 19, the day of the film's release, an explanatory script for The Da Vinci Code: Behind the Scenes of the Main Screenplay by screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, with introductions by Ron Howard and Don Brown, was published by Doubleday and Broadway Books. It includes film stills, behind-the-scenes photos and the full script. There were 25,000 copies of the paperback edition and 200,000 copies of the paperback edition.[28] Riddles Book Jacket As part of the novel's promotional campaign, the US edition's book jacket will feature some artwork, as well as clues, and the reader who solves them will be awarded a prize via the author's website. After several thousand people found the codes, the winner was drawn in early 2004 and announced live on Good Morning America. The prize is a trip to Paris Five Hidden Riddles Revealed: The book on the book jacket has diagonal and vertical sub-dots written alternately, pink on dark red. Add a degree to the dash and you'll find the CIA headquarters in Northern Virginia, home to the mysterious statue of Kryptos. These sub-points were taken while deciphering the text of the second part of the statue (Part 4 is not yet resolved). Brown was asked why the sub-points were one degree apart. ""It was a planned mess,"" he replied. The book jacket has bold letters. Hidden within the book folds is a secret message. Message: No help for the widow's son (see Freemasonry). The words ""Only WW knows"" can be seen on the book cover. A torn part of the book cover bears the phrase upside down. This would also be a reference to Part 2 of The Cryptos Statue.[29] A circle with numbers, between the Doubleday logo and the barcode, reveals a secret message. These are chapter numbers in abbreviations arranged in a Caesar box format. It is written upside down on the cover of a puzzle book in the first cryptex. On his website and in person, he noted that clues to the theme of his next novel, The Last Symbol, lie in the riddles on the book jacket. It repeats themes from his earlier novels. For example, there was a hidden message in the Deception Point, which Brown claimed would solve The Da Vinci Code. A simplified Chinese version of The Da Vinci Code has a secret text on the envelope that can be easily deciphered. in it: ""13-3-2-1-1-8-5 Oh, Draconian Devil! Oh, lame man! Note. Find Robert Langdon."" It's the multi-coded clue in invisible ink near the corpse in the museum that kicks off the plot of the entire novel. All of these puzzles, listed below the pages, were found in the page titles of the mass market American paperback edition of The Da Vinci Code.

"Algebra or Algebra (Algebra, in Arabic al-jabr[1]) is an important branch of mathematics. Covers the areas of number theory, geometry, and analysis. Algebra in general is the study of mathematical forms and the laws that govern them.[2][3] Basic algebra is essential not only for mathematics, science and engineering but also for medicine and economics. The pioneers of algebra are al-Khwarizumi (780 – 850) and Omar Khayyam (1048–1131).[4] Algebra is the next step to arithmetic which is based on numbers alone. Arithmetic is taught first in mathematics. Therefore Arithmetic is really the epitome of mathematics. The main difference between Arithmetic and Algebra is that algebra deals with variables and constants for numbers of general form. Basic algebra consists of making abstract predictions using variables. Arithmetic deals with numbers and the basic operations performed with them. In basic algebra, instead of numbers, variables like x and y and constants like a and b are used to perform mathematical operations.[5] For example, E = m c 2 {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}} In the equation, E {\displaystyle E} and m {\displaystyle m} Characters are variables, c {\displaystyle c} is a constant. And as algebra goes higher and higher it expands and goes under various names. A mathematician who studies algebra is called an algebraist. Alphabetical representation method Arithmetic is a variety of calculations along with arithmetic calculations and many other definitions. In this you can copy the letters instead of the numbers and write the general pattern - pattern - formulas - sentence as the answer. Another special difference is that it involves computation involving hidden numbers - opposite numbers. Earlier we use Tamil letters instead of numbers and now we use English, Greek and Latin letters. The subject matter is the same. 5 + 5 + 5 = 3 x 5 (three times five) 5 + 5 + 5 = 3 x 5 (three times five). Since these are all in clear numbers, we can calculate this as 3 x 5 = 15. But in arithmetic it is considered as adding three times the same value number. Thus 5 + 5 + 5 can be written as a + a + a. This means that a number is added three times. To understand the answer, let's replace a in alphabetic arithmetic with a coconut and represent it arithmetically. Now we can write one coconut + one coconut + one coconut. The answer is three coconuts. In alphabetic mathematics, a coconut is written as a singular word with the word one removed. The answer three coconuts is also written as three coconuts as a singular word. Coconut comes as a singular word in both cases, so 1 is not written in front of the letter to distinguish them. For all other positions, the letter should be preceded by its number. No plural is shown for the subject. So one coconut + one coconut + one coconut means It can be written as coconut + coconut + coconut. = three coconuts. (answer) Now the answer for Arithmetic should be given in Alphabetical Math. To get from alphabetic math to arithmetic we changed a to coconut. Now to go the opposite way from Arithmetic to Alphabetic we have to convert coconut to a.) Three coconuts = three a's (coconut is reduplicated as a) = 3 a (three is transposed to 3) 3 a = 3 x a This is an intermediate position. This is the explanation. 3 a is the answer. Here the quality sign which is the multiplication sign is not written. Just as in three coconuts the sign is omitted, in alphabetic arithmetic the sign should be omitted between the number and the letter. . Three grades of coconuts are called three grades of coconuts, excluding Dharam - Dhara. Coconuts are not used to talk about three. In three coconuts, first the number three and then the word coconut should be written in alphabetical order, first the number and then the letter. It is incorrect to write 3a as a3 as the final answer. The interpolation can be predicted by writing a x 3 (a to the power of 3). Direction numbers. The next most important subject in arithmetic is vectors. It classifies numbers greater than and above the limit as positive integers. These are the 1, 2, 3, 4, .... etc. that we use and the decimals (ratio, fraction, decimal) in between. These can be written as normal without any prepositions or with the sign of saka in the upper half before the number. This ""+"" prefix indicates precision without specifying computation. The opposite is called anti-direction or hypo-direction. Accordingly, the lowest and lowest numbers are hidden numbers. 'Hidden numbers must be written with the prefix "" - "" sya.' If there is nothing before it then only the prefix "" - "" saya is sufficient. If this is preceded by a sign indicating a calculation, that number and its leading sign must be written in parentheses. The prefix is ​​written before the digit, in the upper half. If there is no sign, then it is an even number with a sign of the same sign. The value of a digit's block does not change when the successive sign and arithmetic sign preceding a digit are changed to its opposite sign. Puchiyam is not included in the vector. All human thoughts about numbers in history began with the study of the mutual relations between 1, 2, 3, ... The first class of derivatives belongs to the category algebra. Some theorems about numbers were found in the Greek texts of Euclid and the treatises of Diophantus. However, the first book on algebra was written in India by a mathematician named Aryabhata in the 5th century AD. This is known as algebra. Hisab al-dschabr wa-l-muqabala was written by al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century, adapting the 4th century treatises of Diophantus. Later in the 13th century an Arabic text entitled ""al-jabr"" was published claiming to be derived from this Persian text. This branch of mathematics was named Algebra after this. In the 17th century, its Latin translation appeared as Ludus algebrae et almucgrabalaeque. After this, algebraic studies progressed globally. Greek Algebra Algebra is a language. Algebra is a set of notational symbols and some rules for how they should be related to each other. But for this type of language to be used, the language must have a proper notation. That is where Greek mathematics failed. Everything to them is geometry. He had great talent in geometry. Even numbers are to them the magnitudes of a straight line. So the conventional algebraic concept of 'variable' did not agree with their ideas. ( x + y ) 2 , ( x − y ) 2 {\displaystyle (x+y)^{2},(x-y)^{2}} Opportunities for, x 2 − y 2 = ( x + y ) ( x − y ) {\displaystyle x^{2}-y^{2}=(x+y)(x-y)} Such absolute relations they knew through geometry. But they had neither the intention nor the means to create relationships through algebraic variables and deal with those relationships. There was another reason why their progress in algebra was so poor. That was their fear of infinities.Archimedes pi ( Pi {\displaystyle \pi } The method used to find the value of ) is called the method of exhaustion. Repeat and multiply the number of sides of a polygon by dividing its perimeter by the length of the diameter each time by π {\displaystyle \pi } It is the method of finding values ​​for . (circumference / diameter of circle) is the 'boundary' of (circumference / diameter of inscribed polygon) The concept of 'infinity' is concluded with the concept of 'infinity'. It seems that they did not leave this concept of 'boundary' within their boundaries because of the fear of infinity! Algebra in Ancient India Ancient India developed a place value scheme for writing numbers and laid the foundation for future mathematical notation. We can see the use of this ranking scheme in the book 'Yavanajatakam' written by Spujitvajar (3rd century). The book is a paraphrase of a prose treatise written in India in the second century on the lost Greek system of divination. A Bakhshali manuscript (70 pages) believed to have been written in the first few centuries of the Christian era was discovered in 1881 near Peshawar in present-day Pakistan. It has fluent use of the decimal place value system and a dot for rotation. Fractions, square roots, linear unitary equations, quadratic equations, compound series, multiplicative series—these take place. Also in this book, the basic mathematical rule which the Arabs took from India and named as 'Golden Rule' is described. This can be called the pay-benefit-desire rule. This is called Rule of Three in English. What this means is, If so much giving gives so much benefit, how much benefit will so much desire give? Rule to answer this: Give - Use - Desire Write these three in this order. Multiply the middle by the last and divide by the first. This is the answer! Both giving and desire are one and the same. Benefits may vary by unit. Indeterminate Equations are first found in writing in Indian mathematics in this Pakshali manuscript. Although the Greek Diophantus studied these equations in the 4th century, Indian mathematicians Brahmagupta (7th century), Bhaskar I (600 - 680), Bhaskar II (1114-1185) discovered and wrote many solutions to the mathematical equations. Bhaskara II's Chakravala system is still in use today. Major Contribution of European Countries In 1619, Descartes introduced fractional geometry, which transformed geometry into an algebraic function. The use and demand for algebra increased as it made it possible to establish geometric theorems with algebraic symbols without having to look at the shapes themselves. It was in this century that Newton's differential calculus was discovered. Accordingly the important discovery was made that the slope of a series of drafts can be classified by Acharpin. Thus, the properties of toothed drafts began to be analysed. As soon as the large and small values ​​of the functions needed in everyday practice in physics and engineering were studied with micromathematics, all calculations eventually came down to algebraic operations. All this led to the involvement of many mathematicians in algebra. Solving equations is the first problem that strikes one upon entering algebra. The goal of algebraic studies was to try to find an exact solution to each of the first algebraic equations. A great solution to this problem came only in the 19th century. But in these four centuries algebra has blossomed into a sky-scraping branch of intermediation from the pursuit of this problem. A list of the people behind this development cannot be written. Prominent (in chronological order): Cardano (1501–1576), (Italy) published solutions to quadratic and quadratic equations in 1545. Vieta (1540-1603), (France) π {\displaystyle \pi } who invented an infinite multiplication of He is hailed by some as the father of modern algebra, even though he introduced many new symbols that were not successful. Fermat (France) (1601-1665), pioneered many studies in number theory. A theorem bearing his name was a mantra that allowed number theory and algebra to grow like a banyan tree without anyone being able to establish whether it was true or false for three centuries. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) (England) is one of the three major contributors to the history of mathematics. In addition to his micromathematics, the theory of gravitation, his other inventions in algebra include: the binomial theorem; Studies on stratigraphy. Leibnitz (Germany) (1646-1716), from whom came the hydraulic system that is the basis of all modern computers. Father of modern day probability theory. He spontaneously invented micro-mathematics and introduced today's notation. Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) (Switzerland) was responsible for many theorems in statistics and probability theory. Bernoulli numbers are named after him. Euler (1707-1783), (Switzerland, Russia, Germany) There is no branch of mathematics without his contribution. He is responsible for many mathematical symbols such as dependence. Introduced factorial methods in number theory. He announced new methods for the solution of quadratic equations. He also developed many fields such as continued fractions and exponential series. He was the founder of the great theorem that would come later called the Prime Number Theorem and the quadratic inverse. Father of Golak doctrine. His book Algebra gives many possibilities for the solution of polynomial equations. Lagrangian (1736-1813), (Italian) Major contributions to number theory and probability theory. Gauss (1777-1855), (Germany) Major contribution to number theory. His is the fundamental theorem of algebra that every polynomial equation of a complex number must have at least one root. Cauchy (1789-1857), (France). Among his multifaceted contributions, the Theory of Substitutions, which is going to change algebra and the field of mathematics in the 20th century, should be mentioned here. In the early 20th century, it started microfield algebra as permutation family. Mathematical objects need not be numbers or functions. It has become a mathematical tradition since the twentieth century to create mathematical systems based on the relationships they have with each other, to develop theorems on that microscale, and to apply the same theorem to different applications in many different situations. Koshy was the seed of this in a way. Galva (1811-1832), (France) made a great achievement in mathematics within the age of twenty and created the mathematical branch called Galva's theory that mathematicians are still engaged in in the laboratory today. This gave the final solution to the five-step equation that had puzzled all mathematicians for centuries. Abel (1802-1829), Jacobi (1804-1851), Hamilton (1805-1865), Sylvester (1814-1897), Cayley (1821-1895) Other Faces of Algebra Another facet of algebra is number theory. Since the time of the Greeks, problems involving numbers have fascinated everyone involved in mathematics. From that time to the present, every advance that man has made in number theory has expanded the horizons of the field of mathematics, especially the field of algebra. Number theory has become one of the largest branches of mathematics nowadays, so refer to it in a separate article. Another facet of clan theory is one such major division. How it came to be, however, traces its roots to the great development of microfield algebra in the twentieth century. Quotations Supplements Eli Maor. e: The story of a number. 1994.

One of the southern states of India. It borders Tamil Nadu on the east and Karnataka on the north. To the west is the Arabian Sea. Malayalam is the primary language of Kerala. Tamil speakers are also seen more. Thiruvananthapuram is the capital of Kerala. Other notable cities are Kochi, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kottayam. Kerala has the highest literacy (literacy) rate among Indian states. Scholars claim that the name Kerala derives from the Tamil word ""seralam"" (mountain slope) or Chera country.[9][10] Today's Kerala was historically known as the ""Sera Nadu"". A 3rd century inscription of Emperor Ashoka mentions Kerala - ""Keralaputras"".[11] Also, in the map of the Roman merchant Pericles, he refers to present day Kerala as Cheraputra. The people of Kerala are known as Malayalis.[12] It means those who live in the hills (Western Ghats). Highlights On 5 April 1957, it was the first country in Asia to come to power under a democratic system, the first Communist Party to come to power. Adi Shankara (788-820 AD) was born at Kaladi Origin of Indian classical dance form ""Kathakali"". India's leading rubber producing state The Aromatic Garden of India Kalaripairai is the birthplace of martial arts India's first digital state[13] Among the Indians working in the Gulf countries, there are more people from Kerala state. So foreign exchange gets extra for Kerala.

History Kerala is a mythical country that emerged when Parasurama's ax split the ocean. Many Europeans like Portuguese, Dutch, British established their dominance in Kerala. By 1947 Kerala was divided into three princely states namely Travancore, Kochi and Malabar. According to the Malabar Reorganization Act 1956, Travancore, Cochin and Malabar regions were merged and present day Kerala emerged in November 1956. Economy Agriculture is the main industry. Cash crop cultivation is increasing more than food crop cultivation. Traditional industries such as handloom, rope and handicrafts are also doing well.

"Canals are divided into canals for irrigation and canals for shipping. Canals are man-made straits for transportation. Cuts connecting two seas, rivers, or lakes are cut with the aim of shortening the navigation distance. Suez Canal and Panama Canal are notable canals cut for shipping. HISTORY Cattle-driven cart transport capacity was within a certain limit. A mule can carry goods weighing up to 250 pounds (113kg) for days or weeks in a locked cart of up to 8 tons [1].[1] It is suitable for very small spaces and periods and requires roads for carriages. Instead, the canal was suitable for simple, cheap transportation in ancient times. The earliest known canals in ancient history were irrigation canals, which were built in ancient Mesopotamia around BC. Built 4000 years ago, now in the countries of Iraq and Syria. The Indus Valley Civilization, in ancient India, developed modern irrigation and storage systems, including reservoirs built at Kirnar.[2] Canals in Egypt At least during the reign of Pepy I Mary] (reign 2332–2283 BC) a canal was built across the Nile near Aswan.[3] In ancient Chinese history, major canals for river transport were developed in the period 481-221 BC. According to the ancient historian Siva Gyan, the longest canal was built at Hanga Kha. The canal intersects the regions of Chang, Zhang, Chen, Cai, Gao and Wei.[4] The longest canal in the world today, and one of the tallest canals, is the Grand Canal of China. Still in use today.[5] Greek engineers were the first to use aqueducts as early as the 3rd century BC to regulate the flow of water in the ancient Suez Canal.[6][7][8] Significance Historically canals have been of great importance to trade and development, and the growth of a civilization. By 1855 the Lehigh Canal was mining 1.2 million tons of clean-burning analamic coal; The canal, which was in operation for about a century, was discontinued in the 1930s by its developer. Some of the canals still in operation in our modern times have been a necessary driving force for the economy, and indeed urbanization and industrialization have necessitated canals. Transportation of bulk raw materials such as coal and ores is difficult without water transportation and relatively less expensive compared to other types of transportation. During the 17th and 20th centuries a cycle of increased mechanization resulted in industrial developments and new metals fueling such raw materials. As new fields of research led to new industries and economic progress, the need for canals was critical to any industrialized society to raise the standard of living. Surviving canals, including most ship canals, today primarily serve the freight and large shipping industries, while canals that once served inland waterways have since become abandoned, neglected, and drained. Whereas dams were used to control and store flood water and for pleasure boat traffic. Canal shipping first boomed in the United States in the mid-1850s, but canal traffic soon declined and was largely abandoned with the advent of cheaper rail transportation. By the early 1880s, canals were off the map as economically competitive with railroads. Over the next two decades, coal exports declined sharply with the introduction of oil-fired thermal generation, and the demand for coal declined. Later, after World War I, with the advent of the motor vehicle, freight traffic with small American embankments and multiple trains saw a steady decline in ten-mile stretches, flexibility and the ability to carry freight on steep inclines increased along road traffic, and road replaced freight rail that could not operate in the winter. Traffic increased. Construction of canals can be done in one or a combination of the following three ways, depending on available water and route available: Man-made Streams Canals can be created artificially even where natural streams do not exist. What if? Canals can be created by artificially deepening and strengthening their banks with stone and cement concrete mixtures. Water for the canal should be supplied from an external source such as streams or reservoirs. In the new waterways, barrages were built to raise and lower ships in the canals by sophisticated engineering works such as hoists or elevators. E.g. Canals that connect valleys on higher ground, such as the Canal du Midi, Canal de Prairie, and the Panama Canal. A canal can be constructed by scouring and deepening the existing lake bed sand. After the canal dredging is completed, the water in the lake is reduced and the canal is filled with water to serve as drainage for drainage of the surrounding area and for waterway transport. E.g. Lage Ward (nl). Build two parallel embankments in a lake, lay a new canal between the embankments, and then drain the rest of the lake water so that only the excess water is in the canal and the rest of the lake is drained. The North Sea Canal in the eastern and central parts was constructed in this manner. Canal and waterway construction A natural stream can be converted into a canal to create a controlled waterway that can be easily predicted. How is this possible? The flow of water is regulated by deepening and diverting and diverting the course of the stream. This allows cargo to be transported very easily by small boats and large ships. E.g. The coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania includes the Lehigh Canal on the Passo Savon, the Canal de Mines de Fer las Moselle, and the Eisen River. Lateral canals When the natural stream cannot be converted into a channel, an artificial channel parallel to the side is constructed to give way to the second stream. This is called the lateral canal. Natural streams sometimes have continuous curves, horseshoe-shaped curves and when they are unrepairable, lateral canals can be easily constructed to have a smooth flow path, and the natural stream will act as a source of water for the canal. E.g. These include the Sasapeake and Ohio Canal, the Lateral La Loire Canal, the Carron Latnal Canal, and the Juliana Canal. Irrigation canals are of three types namely river irrigation canals, supply canals, diversion canals, irrigation canals or canals.[9] Supply Channel (Supply Channel) Heads of supply channels are cut only at certain bends in rivers. When cut like that, only water from the river goes into the canal. Sand will be prevented from entering. And even during periods of low flow in the river, water flows into the canal unhindered. An example of this is the canal that carries water from the Vaigai River to North Lake. Surplus Channel or Surplus Channel Surplus Channel is a channel that discharges the surplus water of the lakes through Kalingal during floods. Their capacity is equal to the capacity of the lake drainage channel. Water inflow and outflow will be balanced to prevent flooding. Irrigation channel or distribution channel Water is distributed to the irrigated lands through these canals set up on the outside of the lake bed. These canals were built according to the size of the lands and were called Kannar, Vati and Pilaru. Floating Cities Canals are so closely associated with the city of Venice that many (canal) floating cities are named ""Venice of ..."" The city is built on marshy islands, with wooden frames used to support the buildings, and the city is man-made. The islands have a long history; By the 12th century, Venice was a powerful city. Amsterdam was built like Venice. It became a city in the 1300s. Many canals were built as a strong part of Amsterdam. The city expanded and houses were built along the canals. Other cities with extensive canal infrastructure include: Almamarr, Amerspoort, Bulwart, Breil, Delft, Den Bosch, Togum, Dordrecht, Nkuijn, Franker, Gouda, Haarlem, Harlingen, Leeuwarden, Leiden, Sneek, and Utrecht in the Netherlands; Praji and Gent's Blonders, Belgium; Birmingham in England; Saint Petersburg in Russia; Aveiro in Portugal; Hamburg and Berlin in Germany; Fort Lauderdale and Cape Coral, Florida, USA and Lahore, Pakistan. The Liverpool Seaport is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the heart of Liverpool, England, where infiltrating waterways and reservoirs have been developed, mainly for residential and recreational use.

"The Amazon River (Sri Lankan case: Amazon River, commonly abbreviated as Amazon ( or ; Spanish and Portuguese: Amazonas)) is a river in the South American continent. It is one of the two longest rivers in the world. The other is the Nile River. The Amazon River is the largest river in the world by volume of water. And according to some authors, it is the longest river in the world, larger than the Mississippi, the Nile, and the Yangtze combined more than The course of this river has changed many times. Originally flowing towards the west, this river flows towards the east due to the growth of the Andes Mountains. The Amazon River is not crossed by a bridge anywhere. This is not because of its width, but because modern engineers can build a bridge across it. However, as most of the river flows through tropical rainforests and there are few cities there is no need for a bridge. Although the Amazon River is the largest in the world by various measures, it is only slightly shorter than the Nile in terms of length, according to most geographers. However, some scientists from Brazil and Peru refuse to accept this. The river discharges approximately 209,000 cubic meters per second—approximately 6,591 cubic kilometers per year, more than the next seven largest rivers combined—and the Amazon accounts for 20% of the world's river discharge.[1] The Amazon basin is the world's largest drainage basin, covering an area of ​​approximately 7,050,000 square kilometers (2,720,000 sq mi). Countries where the Amazon flows Although its tributaries originate in Peru and Ecuador, most of its riverbed is located in Brazil. Amazon has more than six thousand affiliates. Out of these 17 rivers have a length of more than 1000 km. Watershed The Amazon drainage basin is the largest in the world. It accounts for approximately 40 percent of the area of ​​South America. A catchment area of ​​this is found in the inner Andean highlands. The area is close to the Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River drains a lot of water into the Atlantic Ocean. During the rainy season the flow was up to 300,000 cubic meters per second and during the period 1973-1990 it was approximately 209,000 cubic meters. The Amazon basin is connected to the basin of the Orinoco, another major river in South America, by the Caziquier Canal. So it is called a natural water connection. Although the term canal refers to the Casiquiuer, it is a tributary of the upper Orino River. It runs south to join the Rio Negro, a tributary of the Amazon. ORIGIN The Amazon River is a large multi-tributary river system in Peru and Ecuador. Many flow directly into rivers such as the Maranon and Ugayali. Several rivers like the Marana, Pastaza, Nuguere, etc. flow into the main Amazon River. It was established in 2001-2007 that the Amazon is formed in the glacial lake of the snow-capped Navato Misimi peak in the Andean mountain range of Peru. It is west of Lake Titicaca and southeast of Lima. Water from the Navado Misimi flows into the Cupiradas Carcusanta and Apaceda Rivers, which join the Rio Apurimac, a tributary of the Ugayali River. The Ugayali joins the Marañon to form the main Amazon River. This location is considered by most geologists to be the origin of the primary Amazon. The river here is called Solimos dos Aguas in Brazil. After a thousand miles the dark colored Rio Negro joins the muddy Amazon. For six miles the two run in unbroken succession. Floods Not all Amazon tributaries flood at the same time. Most of them start flooding in November and last till June. The Rio Negro begins to flood in February or March and recedes by June. The Medirera floods and recedes two months before other Amazon tributaries. The average depth of the river during monsoon is 40 feet. The main river is approximately one to six miles wide. Larger ocean-going cells can reach as far as Manaus. Smaller 3000 ton or 9000 ton cells with the lower part of the cell up to 18 feet above the water level can travel up to 3600 km in the river. Estuary There is a difference of opinion among experts regarding the width of its estuary due to the geography of the estuary. The Para River is counted along with the Amazon. Sometimes the Para River is considered a separate tributary of the Tocantins River. The estuary of the Para River is larger. The Para and Amazon rivers are connected by various canals. Between these lies Marajó Island. Its area is as big as Switzerland. Wildlife One-third of the world's species live in the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon basin and rainforest cover more than 5.4 million square km (2.1 million sq mi). More than 3,000 species of fish have been found in the Amazon River. The Amazon River Dolphin lives in the Amazon and Orinoco River basins. It is the largest of the river dolphin species. It can grow up to 100 feet. Birnka is the most common type of fish found here. They live in groups. These can attack animals like cows and deer. Humans have also been attacked. However, some species of pirangas attack humans. The red-bellied branca is particularly virulent in humans. Anaconda snakes are found along the shores of the Amazon basin. It is one of the largest snake species. They mostly live in water. Only its nose is above the water level. Amazon rainforest Main article: Amazon rainforest The Amazon rainforest begins east of the Andes mountain range. It is the world's largest rainforest and ecologically important. It is capable of consuming a large amount of carbon-dioxide emitted in the world. Protecting these rainforests is a major issue these days. The very humid Amazon Basin is a bastion of these rainforests. In this region, the Amazon River and its hundreds of tributaries flow very slowly and then flow into the ocean. This biologically rich rainforest is home to 25 lakh species of insects, thousands of plant species and approximately two thousand birds and mammals. A fifth of the world's bird species live in these forests. The Amazon rainforest is located mostly in Brazil, making it the second largest forested area (4,776,980 sq km) after Russia.

"Music is ordered, controlled, beautiful sound. The word music means to make music. Music is a blessing that makes man and other creatures sing. Music is also called Sravana art. Sangeet is the art of tones (sounds) that are pleasing to the ear. Music is known as natham in vernacular. Music today has many uses. Now music is spreading from the educated to the layman. Twenty percent of the videos viewed daily on the Internet are music videos[1]. History From many materials obtained through archeological studies, it is possible to infer what music was like in ancient times. In the Paleolithic era, humans drilled holes in bones and used them as flutes. The seven-holed flute, as well as some types of stringed instruments, have been found in archeology dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization.[2] India is known to have one of the oldest musical traditions[3].

Singing is music. Acting is drama. The play is referred to as Palanthamil Koothu. Koothu is a game played with feet according to Pannisai. A drama is a series of narrations that show a story event. During the Sangam era, the one who sang the song was called a song. The person who played the drama was called Porunar. Music Modes The world offers a variety of music modes. They are: Indian music European music Persian music Greek music Egyptian music Chinese music Arabic music Each of these has different features. Some of the best features have been exchanged between them. Indian Music India is a very big country. It has subsumed hundreds of races/tribes, languages ​​and cultures. Thus, the arts like music, dance, drama etc. which are expressions of these cultures are spread all over the country with various differences. Among these, music occupies a very important place. The musical forms of India have a very ancient history. groomed over the centuries and in a rich mature state. Known all over the world. Apart from these, many rural and local music traditions are being studied along with the social, economic and spiritual needs of the respective region. The following are some of the major musical traditions of India. Karunadama music Hindustani music Ghazal Qawwali Country music Palandamili music Karunataka music Karunataka music or Pannisai is a form of South Indian music. It is considered as one of the oldest music forms in the world. It originated in Tamil Nadu 2000 years ago.[5] In Tamil, these seven musical instruments were called 'Swaram', which were called the seven musical instruments: voice, tuttam, kaiklai, uzi, ili, vliri and taram. These seven swaras namely Shatjam, Rishapam, Gandharam, Madthimam, Panchamam, Taivatam and Nishadam are represented by the letters Sa - Ri - Ka - Ma - Pa - Ta - Ni. Rural music Rural music is a type of music composed by common people living in villages. These are also known as folk music and folk songs. ""Ilaiyaraaja is the one who spread soul-smelling rural music all over Tamil Nadu. Ilayaraja was the one who stood at the top of the musician's imagination and presented songs that were a combination of rural metu, rural musical instruments but instruments in western style."" Country music instruments are trumpets Trichinnam Kanjira Priest's handcuffs The chase dress Damattam Palanthamil Music Palanthamil music is the oldest musical heritage of the Tamil people. When it is referred to as Palandamisai, the musical style, characteristics and changes of the Tamil language before the European rule are mentioned here. Sangattamila is of three types namely Iyal, Music and Drama. The music in this is Tamil music. Music and the accompanying Kuthu began to develop and flourish before the people of Palanthamil came into close contact with other ethnic groups. Grammatical Tamil texts emerged explaining the artistic techniques of music and koothu. The period in which these books were written is known as the Trident period. This three-thousand-year period was approximately three thousand years ago. Therefore, we can be sure that Tamil music and music have been divine arts since three thousand years ago. Hindustani Music Hindustani music is a musical tradition prevalent in North India. Similar to Karunadaka music, rhythm and raga are important elements here. Vedic period till AD. Till the 13th century only one musical tradition was found throughout India. After the Mohammedan conquest of North India, Hindustani music was formed by the fusion of Persian and Arabic music. This music and Carnatic music originated from Samakhan. Similar to the changes in Indian culture after the Muslim conquest of northern India after Sarangadeva's reign in the 13th century, Indian music also underwent changes. Characteristics of Indian Music Indian music is based on melody. Western music is based on harmony. The raga system of Indian music, melams 40 with pakaichuras and melams 32 without pakaichuras are dealt with in Karunataka music today. But the forerunners of all these were Devar Panams. Devaram is the oldest form of music in the history of Indian music with raga rhythm. Devara pans were the source of innumerable ragas. At the time when Devar Bhatigams were sung, there was only one type of music all over India. At that time there was no division into Hindustani and Karnataka. So it can be said that Indian music is a base of music. Musical texts In the Tamil context, the ancient triads maintained and nurtured music. Many musical texts were composed. They were destroyed by time.Thus The hidden texts are Muthunarai, Muthukuru, Citasai, Parisai, Perunarai, Perunguruku, Pancha Bharatiyam, Bharatam, Agathiyam, Seiyatiyam, Characterization is also mentioned.

"Nicolaus Copernicus or Nicolaus Copernicus (/koʊˈpɜːrnɪkəs,kə-/;[2][3][4] Niklas Koppernigk; Polish: Mikołaj Kopernik;[5] German: Nikolaus Kopernikus; February 19, 1473 – May 24, 1543) was an astronomer. , Mathematician and Economist. He laid down a revolutionary principle centered on Katiravan and ushered in a new development in astronomy. He showed the world that the planets revolve around the sun, changing the principle that existed in Europe in the 15th century that other planets revolve around the earth. Ptolemy, the great astronomer of Greece, died in AD. In 140, he laid out the best system for explaining the geocentric principle. This policy, which was universally accepted at the time, has not changed over the centuries. Later, Aristotle, a Greek astronomer, discovered that everything, including the Earth, revolved around the Sun, but this theory was not accepted at the time as it was considered contrary to religious beliefs. Nicolaus Copernicus discovered that the planets revolve around the sun. He was born in Poland. Some also believe that he was a Pole of German descent. He was a polymath, mathematician, astronomer, jurist with a doctorate in law, physician, translator who knew four languages, paleontologist, artist[6], Catholic priest, governor, ambassador and economist who played a major role in the European Renaissance. Life summary Nicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473 in Thorn, Royal Prussia, Poland.[7][8] His father was a big businessman in Krakow. Mother Barbara Watsonrad Thorne, daughter of the city's richest man. Nicholas was the fourth son born to the couple. His father moved from Krakow to Thorn where he became a respected citizen. He was a wealthy copper trader and died when Nicholas was ten years old. Not much is known about his mother, Barbara Watsonrod. However, she is believed to have predeceased her husband. After their father's death, Nicholas and his three siblings (one brother, two sisters) were apparently raised by their maternal uncle. Till the end he never married and devoted his full attention to his studies. He was proficient in Latin, Italian, Polish, Italian and Greek. In 1491 Copernicus was admitted to the University of Krakow. It was here that he became familiar with astronomy. He developed an interest in astronomy with the help of his tutor, Albert Brutczewski (Albert Blahr). Four years later, after a further stay in Thorne, he went to Italy and studied law at the University of Bologna. His father-in-law, who funded his education, wanted Copernicus to become an archbishop. While studying there, he met the teacher Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara, who was a famous astronomer. Copernicus studied with him and became his disciple and assistant. Astronomical theories before the time of Copernicus Ptolemy Ptolemy's theory stated that the sun and the planets revolved around the earth in great circles. This is called different in English. Planets move in small circular orbits over these arcs. These smaller arcs were given as epicycles. Arisutattil Arisutattil explored and said that everything, including the earth, revolves around Katiravana. He accepted the principles of earth, water, air and fire. He said that between the Earth and the Moon there are the fixed planets Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars and Jupiter, which move in a fixed horizontal orbit centered on the Earth. Copernicus Principle Copernicus' heliocentric principle is simple. However, the influence of Greek thought was also present in his policy. According to Copernicus' principle, the great circle of the planets and the small circles are centered on the Sun. He introduced small circular arcs into his theory to explain the retrograde motion of the planets and their light differences. Not only that, he also mentioned that the stars are far away in the sky. Copernicus' principle of rotation Copernicus' principle of rotation consists of seven parts. There is no common center for the celestial sphere (especially the fallacy that the Earth is the center of everything). The center of the earth is not the center of the universe. It is the center of Earth's gravity and the center of the Moon's orbit. All the planets revolve around the Sun. The distance of the Sun from the Earth is imperceptibly small compared to the distance of the firmament where the most distant stars are from the Earth. Earth rotates on its axis daily. Distant stars appear to move due to the Earth's rotation, when in reality the stars are fixed in the fixed sky. The movement of the sun is not really the movement of the sun. Sensation of earth moving. The appearance of retrograde motion and the appearance of forward motion of the planets are not theirs. They are created by the movement of the earth. SCIENTIST ACCEPTANCE Copernicus' opinion was not taken seriously by the general public and astronomers of the time ""Earth is not the center of the universe. Earth is an ordinary planet like the planets orbiting the Sun."" Religionists and astronomers disagreed. Also his book On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies (On The Revolutions of The Heavenly Bodies) was in Latin, so most people could not read it. Due to this his book was not proud. It was only when Italian astronomers like Galileo Galilei (1564-1642 AD) and Bruno accepted Copernicus's principles and set out to establish them that the world's eyes fell on Copernicus' book. Its anti-religious principles were felt by religious people. 73 years after the publication of the book. B. The book was banned in 1616. The ban was not lifted until the end of the 18th century. A multifaceted achiever, Copernicus was a physician, a judge, a governor, an economist, a mathematician, and a Catholic priest. However, he did not hesitate to promulgate heliocentrism against religious principles. Death Copernicus died in 1543 after suffering a stroke and was in a coma. It is said that while he was in a trance, his book was printed and placed in his arms, and he immediately recovered from his trance, regained consciousness and died after looking at the book, his life's achievement.[9] Kudos Copernicium On 14 July 2009 they discovered the chemical element Copernicium in Cerumani. Then the element was discovered as the 112th element. Initially, it was given the provisional name Ununbium and later it was proposed that the planet be named Copernicium (Cn) in memory of Nicolaus Copernicus. IUBE then officially adopted the name on February 19, 2010.[10] 55 Kangri A 2014 The International Astronomical Union launched a project to give proper names to a handful of exoplanets and their orbits. In this scheme, elections were held to give many new names to Udus and outer planets.[11] In December 2015, the IAU announced that 55 of them, Kangri A, were named after Copernicus.[12] Calendar Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler are canonized on May 23 in the Episcopal Church's Calendar of Saints.[13] Book Svitlana Azarova has written and published a book about Copernicus called ""Mover of the Earth, Stopper of the Sun"".

"Mexico (Spanish: México, ""México"") is a federal republic on the North American continent. Formally it is known as the United Mexican States.[1] The United States of America forms its northern border. To the south and west is the Pacific Ocean. On the southeast border are the countries of Guatemala and Belize and the Caribbean Sea. On the eastern border lies Mexico City.[2] With an area of ​​approximately two million square kilometers (over 760,000 square miles)[3], Mexico is the fifth largest country in the Americas by area and the 13th largest independent country in the world. With a population of 113 million[4] it is the 11th most populous country in the world and the most Spanish-speaking country in the world. Its capital is Mexico City. 31 states join the federal system of Mexico. Besides these, the capital is a federal district. Many cultures matured in pre-Columbian Mexico, culminating in the Olmec, Tholtec, Teotihuacan, Sapotec, Maya, and Azutec civilizations. In 1521, Spain conquered parts of Mexico and established settlements from its base at Mexico-Tenochtitlan. These areas were administered as viceroyalties of the new Esuppain. After the colony's independence was accepted in 1821, these territories became Mexico. In the post-independence period, Mexico faced economic instability, the Mexican-American War, the loss of territories to the United States, civil war, the creation of two empires, and a local dictatorship. Dictatorship spawned the Mexican Revolution of 1910. This was followed by the constitution of 1917 and the present political system. In the elections held in July 2000, the Ethical party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, won the presidency for the first time. Enrique Peña Nieto of that party took office as the President of Mexico.[5] Mexico has one of the largest economies in the world, and is a regional superpower and a middle power. Also, Mexico is the first member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in Latin America. It has been a member of this organization since 1994. Mexico is projected as an upper-middle income country by the World Bank. It is a newly industrialized country and an emerging dynamic country. Mexico has the 13th largest nominal GDP and the 11th largest purchasing power parity. The country's economy is strongly linked to the economies of its North American Free Trade Agreement partners, particularly the United States. Mexico ranks sixth in the world and first in the Americas in terms of the total number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. There are a total of 31 World Heritage Sites here. In 2007, Mexico had the 10th largest foreign tourist arrivals in the world. 21.4 million passengers arrived that year. Since 2006, Mexico has been in the middle of a drug war. Due to this, up to 60,000 people have died. When the region, originally called New Spain, gained independence from Spain, they decided to name the new country after its capital, Mexico City. Mexico City was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Aztec capital Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Although the name is derived from the Nawathil language, the meaning of the word is not clear. ""Mēxihco"" (Mēxihco) in Nahuatl refers to the heartland of the Aztec Empire, the Valley of Mexico, its people, and the surrounding areas. It was a section of the new Essbein before independence. The word is generally considered a toponym for a valley. It was later used as an ethnonym for the Asuttek triad. It could have been the other way around. The suffix -ko is a transpositional element in Nahuatl language. Its combination makes a word a toponym. The name of the country has also changed depending on the system of government. For two periods (1821–1823, 1863–1867) it was known as the ""Mexican Empire"" (Imperio Mexicano - Imperio Mexicano). The name ""United Mexican States"" (Estados Unidos Mexicanos) was used in all three federal constitutions (1824, 1857, 1917). In the Constitution of 1836 it was named the ""Republic of Mexico"". Geography Mexico is located in the southern part of North America between latitudes 14° and 33°N and longitudes 86° and 119°E. Almost all of Mexico's landmass lies on the North American continent. Only parts of the Baja California Archipelago are on the Pacific continent and on the Cocos continent. Geographically, some geologists include the region east of the Teguantapec Isthmus within Central America.[6] Geographically, all of Mexico is considered to be part of North America, along with Canada and the United States.[7] With a total area of ​​1,972,550 square kilometers (761,606 sq mi), Mexico is the 14th largest country in the world by area. In addition, the country covers an area of ​​approximately 6,000 square kilometers (2,317 sq mi) and includes several islands located in the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of California. Based on the distance between the two most distant points on Mexico's landmass, the length of Mexico is more than 3,219 kilometers (2,000 mi). Mexico shares a 3,141 kilometers (1,952 mi) long common border with the United States to its north. To the south it shares an 871 km (541 mi) long border with Guatemala and a 251 km (156 mi) long border with Belize. Mexico has two mountain ranges from north to south, the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra Madre Occidental. It is a series of rocky mountains starting from northern North America. Across the country from east to north is the Sierra Nevada volcanic range in its middle. A fourth mountain range, the Sierra Madre del Sur, runs from Michoacán to Oaxaca.[8] So for the most part, the northern and central parts of Mexico are high elevations. The highest elevations are found in the Trans-Mexico volcanic region. Among these, Pico de Orizaba (5,799 m, 18,701 ft), Popocattabeth (5,462 m, 17,920 ft), Isudaxivath (5,286 m, 17,343 ft) and Nevado de Toluca (4,577 m, 15,016 ft) are important. In the valleys located between these four yarams, three important urban areas are located. These are Toluca, Peru, Mexico City, and Puebla.[8] Administrative Divisions Gulf of Mexico Pacific Ocean Central America United States of America Mexico City AG Baja California Baja California On Campeche Chiapas Chihuahua Coahuila Colima Durango Guanajuato Guerrero HD Jalisco EM Michoacan MO Nayarit Nuevo León Oaxaca Puebla Queretaro Quintana Roo saint Louis Potosi Sinaloa Sonora Tabasco Tamaulipas TL Veracruz Yucatan Zacatecas ""United Mexican States"" means a confederation of 31 independent and sovereign states. The union thus constituted has limited jurisdiction over the Federal Districts of Mexico and other jurisdictions. Each state has its own constitution, state congress, and judiciary. The state governor is directly elected by the people through elections every six years. Members of the State Council are also elected by the people every three years.[9] A federal district is a special political division administered by a central government. It does not belong to any state. It has limited local government powers.[10] States are divided into municipalities. It is the smallest of all political divisions. It is governed by a popularly elected mayor or municipal head.[11] Citations Category:North American countries Category:Member States of the United Nations ",On which continent is Mexico City?,North American,46

Tanjore Tamil University was established by the Tamil Nadu government under Ramachandran's initiative. Chief Minister M.G.R. In a review meeting held on 13th June, 1981 under the chairmanship it was decided that 1000 acres of land is required for the immediate needs and future expansion of the University. Tamil University was established on 1st August 1981 by the Governor of Tamil Nadu promulgating the “Tamil University Ordinance 1981”. Following this, the MGR-led government acquired and allotted 972.7 acres of land to the Tamil University.[15] Position on Tamil Eelam Being born in Kandy in Sri Lanka, interest and activities on Tamil Eelam were seen more in MGR. MGR gave open support for Eelam when he was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Pasa Nedumaran concept was supported by M. G. R. He also wanted a separate country for Tamils ​​under the leadership of LTTE leader Prabhakaran, Tamil National Movement leader Phala. Nedumaran said. Nedumaran has said that he gave Rs 7 crore of his own money to buy the necessary weapons for the struggle of the LTTE led by Prabhakaran. About MGR Prabhakaran gave open support to LTTE and Prabhakaran MGR. He bought weapons and took them to Sri Lanka to save the Tamil people, first he gave two crores of rupees. Prabhakaran has said in an interview that the movement could not have grown to this extent without that help. He also called MGR as brother. He helped the LTTE by giving huge sums of money during the period when the central government was under pressure. MGR told Prabhakaran about his position that he had nothing to do with the action taken by the central government.[16] Even a week before MGR's death Rs. Prabhakaran himself has said that he has given up to 40 lakhs in aid to the LTTE. In his condolence message on MGR's death, Prabhakaran said, ""Honorable Chief Minister MGR, who wanted Tamil people to live freely, LTTE pays a tearful tribute to him"".[17] About MGR's friendship Anton Balasingham has given about the friendship between MGR and LTTE in the year 1984 in his essay on Liberation. ""Unexpectedly MGR's relationship with the liberation movement blossomed. MGR was impressed by leader Prabhakaran's leadership and bravery. It eventually became a friendship."" He has given that in the emancipation essay volume. Director Seeman Upima said, ""There is no one who helped the Elamites like former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Amarar MGR. If only he had lived for another 10 years, the Elamites would have got a separate country. It is a historical tragedy that it did not happen."" [18] Writings Nadodi Mannan Book MGR wrote a book about the film Nadodi Mannan, which he produced himself.[19] In this book, MGR has written about everyone who worked in the film, the story of the film, the stage of making it himself. After the release of this film, MGR said that if he succeeds, he will be a king and if he fails, he will be a tramp. had mentioned.[20] Autobiographical Series 'Why Was I Born?'- Autobiographical series written by MGR in Ananda Vikatan. He did not finish writing it completely. The sequel 'My Life Path' which started next was also not completed.[21] Special Awards and Titles MG Ramachandran aka MGR has received many awards for his service to the screen and public service.

"One of the largest groups of carnivorous organisms is the fungi (Fungii) (Sri. Based on current taxonomy, fungi are classified as a separate kingdom. Infertile soil, plant and animal wastes are changed due to their impact and the soil increases due to their incorporation into the soil. Fungi, initially considered to belong to the plant kingdom, were later classified as a separate bio-kingdom like plants and animals. Fungi are found in all types of ecosystems on Earth. They thrive in dark, moist areas and growing mediums rich in mineral nutrients. A number of important parasitic, and metamorphic organisms are found in the kingdom Fungi. Fungi are non-green eukaryotic organisms. Although they have walled cells like plants, they are not green. The chemical changes caused by these insects cause huge changes in the environment. The branch of science dealing with fungi is called mycology. Fungi are usually invisible. However, they become visible as mushrooms. Like any other micro-organisms, there are beneficial, non-beneficial and harmful ones for humans. These cause diseases like candidiasis; They spoil the food. However, they are used to produce important antimicrobials such as penicillin. Fungi live symbiotically with many plants and other organisms. A very important example of this is the algae (algae-fungi or cyanobacteria-fungi alliance). They act as junctions and help in the penetration of sap into the roots of trees. Characteristics of Fungi Fungi are considered a separate kingdom in biological classification. Although previously classified with plants, fungi have now been classified into a separate kingdom, Fungii, due to their unique nature. Fungi are other nutrients. They cannot produce food by themselves. Fungi are echinoderms. Their cells contain a true, membranous nucleus/nuclei. Their cells contain a vacuole like a plant cell. It has a cell wall of chitin and glucans. (Plant cell wall is probably composed of cellulose) L-Lysine is capable of synthesizing the amino acid. A long thread-like multinucleated cell called a hyphae (pollen filament). Fungi do not have green spores. Anatomy Many fungi grow as hyphae. Pollen filaments grow 2–10 µm in diameter and a few centimeters long. Many pollen filaments join together to form a pollen web (mycelium). Fungi develop by elongating the pollen filament. Growth occurs by fission. Fungi show essentially generic cavity structure because the septum between the nuclei does not completely separate them, even though the nucleation occurs and new nuclei are formed. That is, the entire body (except for the reproductive structures) in a pollen tube is filled with a single continuous vacuole. Thus, apart from the reproductive structures, no other form of filamentation is seen in fungi. New pollen filaments are formed by branching of old pollen filaments. Although most fungi are multicellular (literally multicellular) fungi, the group of fungi known as angiosperms are unicellular fungi. Some fungi have structures called haustoria to carry out their internal feeding. They have many small vacuoles inside their pollen tube. These crematoriums are responsible for the plant crematorium. Apart from this, all the features of a normal eukaryotic (eukaryotic) cell are present in pollen filaments. Since these are usually airways (except for alcohol etc.) they have many filaments. The reproductive structures of members of the Basidiomycota are well developed and form the mushroom pollen visible to the naked eye. A flagellum is not found in any fungal species except some chytid fungi. Growth and physiology The body structure of birds is adapted to their feeding regime. They have a very high surface-to-volume ratio because they have a fibrous structure; Thus fungi have a very high endophytic reactivity. Many are rotifers, decomposers, some are parasitic, and some are symbionts. All fungi thrive on their food. They secrete hydrolytic enzymes onto the substrate/food they grow on. These enzymes act on the food and promote the breakdown of the food into easily absorbable forms such as glucose and amino acids. Fungi grow by taking in these harmful substances. Fungal enzymes can act on all types of biological molecules such as polysaccharides, protein, and lipids. Antibiotics used to kill bacteria cannot kill them. Flowers have a high growth rate. This is why it can be observed that the mushroom has grown overnight and in one day. Fungi use a part of the food they ingest for their growth and reproduction and store the rest as glycogen and oil droplets. Breeding Flowers reproduce by lingam and lingam. Some species do not reproduce sexually, although many perform both methods. Ilingam method of reproduction: Reproduction in lingam is mainly by conidia. Apart from this, stipulations occur in filamentous anthers. This means that when the pollen web is damaged by an external force, each fragment has the potential to grow into a new pollen. Reproduction in Ilingam occurs by budding in individual flowers like madhuvam. Fungi that reproduce exclusively in ylang-yum are classified as Deuteromycota. Sexual reproduction: Most anthers reproduce sexually with meiosis. The life cycle of a flower generally consists of one stage (n), two stages (n+n), two stages (2n). Different fungal assemblages have different levels of dominance. No dicotyledons are found in the gyrate pollen. A mushroom is a dioecious reproductive structure. They show various sexual reproductive structures like zygospore, ascospore, basidospore and zoospore. For example, at the base of a mushroom's umbel, many spores and spores can be observed through a microscope. (Bi-embryonic embryogenesis is a condition in which two embryos (n + n) are united in one cell without fusion (simultaneous-n) at the time of fertilization) During sexual reproduction, the first conjugation of the opposite and opposite sexes takes place. A pregnancy does not occur immediately following their union. First of all, fertilization of the cavity takes place and two embryogenesis begins. At the end of it, there will be blackout. The classification of fungi is Unikonta Amoebozoaapistaconta Animalia Coenozoa Nucleroids Rosellida fungus Microsporidia Chytrediomycota Neocalimasticomycoda Blastocladiomycota Zoobecomycotina Quixellomycotina Entomophthoromycotina Mucoromycotina Glomeromycotadiccarya Ascomycoda Pesidiomycota Major groups of fungi Pollens are classified based on the sexual reproductive structures they produce. Following are the main pujan moments: Chytridiomycota: These are spore-forming fungi. As these stamens have flagella, they are able to move in water. Armadillos are generally aquatic. Among these, there is a hereditary evolution, and both dioecious and monoecious stages are equally dominant. Irugarukuda Avata is not found in these. Almost 1000 species of these are known. They reproduce sexually by dicotyledonous spores and sexually by monocotyledonous spores. This assemblage is the most primitive of the known pollen assemblages. U: Allomyces Zygomycota: Fungi that form dicotyledonous spores are classified within this group. Although there are three stages in their life cycle namely monocot, dikaryon stage and dikaryon stage, the monocot stage is the dominant stage. About 1050 species are included in this group. Pan-grown pot fungus belongs to this type. Among these, prishuvar is not found among the embryos. U-M: Rhizopus, Pilobus Glomeromycota: Does not show sexual reproduction. These are rhizomes that grow in the roots of plants. About 150 species are known. Ascomycota: This genus includes spores that produce cone spores during sexual reproduction. These cells are formed within a structure called ascus. Ilingam produces conidio spores during reproduction. About 45000 species are known. உ-ம்: Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Candida Basidiomycota: Fungi that produce spores during sexual reproduction. These usually form a structure visible to the naked eye called a mushroom. About 22000 species are known. It is significant that Irukarkuta Avata predominates in their circle of life. உம்: Ustilago maydis, Malassezia, Cryptococcus neoformans Ecology Fungi are found in all types of ecosystems on Earth. Bacteria and fungi are important decomposers in biological blocks. So these ensure that the nutrients reach back to the environment. So if the fungi are destroyed, the stability of the Earth's environment will be disrupted. Symbiotic Fungi are known to act as symbionts with organisms from all kingdoms except Archaea. In such a situation there will be interactions between them in such a way that both organisms benefit. Along with plants, some types of fungi (other than pathogens) grow in the roots of plants and form a structure called mycorrhiza. They are usually found in large trees. Mycorrhiza increase the efficiency of water and fertilizer absorption. This benefits the mycorrhizal plant. Fungi get their food from the plant root where they live. In plants with few root hairs, most of the water and fertility requirements are met by mycorrhizae. These structures are known to aid mainly phosphate uptake. Almost 90% of known plants act as symbionts with fungi through mycorrhizae. Evidence for this connection dates back to the last 400 million years. Some fungi live as symbionts in the leaves and stems of plants. The toxins secreted by these insects protect the plant they live in from herbivores. Fungi obtain food and shelter from plants. This relationship can be observed in some types of grasses. Algae and cyanobacteria A lichen is a symbiotic association between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacteria. Lichens are capable of living in rocks where other organisms cannot. This is possible only because of this lifelong alliance. Fungi provide protection, water and fertility retention to the alga/cyanobacteria and also produce food for the alga/cyanobacteria and play a fungal role. Lichens have played an important role in the formation of soil on Earth. Between 17,500 and 20,000 species of fungi (20% of fungi) cause lichens. Uses of Fungi They have many uses both economically and medicinally. Mushrooms, penicillium, and alcohol are the fungi we are most familiar with. Penicillium is used in medicine, alcohol and mushrooms in food. Fungi are used in the production of pharmaceutical antibiotics such as penicillin. Penicillin, derived naturally from the fungus Penicillium, is effective against a small number of bacteria. Therefore, naturally occurring penicillins are modified to produce more potent penicillins. The microbicide griseofulvin is produced from the fungus Penicillium griseofulvum. Fungi are also used to produce drugs that inhibit cholesterol secretion. In food preparation, a unique type of fungus is used in the preparation of pot and liquor. Alcoholic beverages are produced by the fermentation process of Saccharomyces.

"Australia, Australia or Australasia (Australia) is a country that includes the world's smallest continent and the world's largest island, the mainland, the island of Tasmania, and some small islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia. It has no land border with any country. Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea are its neighbors to the north, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia to the north-east and New Zealand to the south-east. History tells us that Aboriginal Australians have lived on the Australian mainland for nearly 42,000 years[1]. After occasional fishermen from the north, and later Dutch explorers from Europe in 1606[2], the British landed in the eastern part of Australia in 1770 and claimed it for the United Kingdom. The colony of New South Wales was created on January 26, 1788, initially as a settlement scheme for English and Scottish convicts. Later, as the population grew, more new areas of Australia were discovered and five more autonomous British colonies were established during the 19th century. On 1 January 1901 the six separate colonies united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, a federal government with an open democratic constitution. Its capital is Canberra. Despite being the sixth largest country by area, it has a population of just 23.2 million (2.32 crore, 2013 estimate[3]). 60 percent of them live in mainland areas around state capitals. Australia follows Western economic systems. Per capita income is on par with strong economies. Only 5% of the workforce is engaged in agriculture. A country rich in oil and minerals. Origin of Name The name Australia is derived from the Latin word Australis. The concept is south. In 1521 the Spaniard became the first European to sail across the Pacific Ocean. The word Australia was first used in the English language in 1625.[4] In 1638 the Dutch East India Company, based in Jakarta, named their new discovery further south Australische. The name ""Australia"" came into widespread use in 1814 when Matthew Flinders, the first British sailor to circumnavigate Australia, used the name ""Australia"" in his book A Voyage to Terra Australis. New South Wales Governor Lachlan Macquarie recommended the name to the colonial government on 12 December 1817[5]. The name was adopted in 1824. In Australian English ""Australia"" is pronounced as əˈstɹæɪljə, -liːə, -jə[6]. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Australia has been referred to locally and internationally as Oz and Australians as Aussie. History Australian Aborigines Studies date the first human settlement of Australia between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago [7]. They are now known as the ancestors of the tribes in Australia. Evidence has been confirmed that they were at Laje Mungo in New South Wales. Although inhabited by humans since before the Stone Age, they are believed to have separated from the present-day Southeast Asian islands very early. Genetically and linguistically, the relationship and relationship of these tribes (with other nationalities) is not confirmed. Majority of these tribes are hunter-gatherers. Melanesians are a tribe living in far-north Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands. Their culture and lifestyle are different from other tribes. Arrival of the European The first European to reach the Australian mainland was the Dutch sailor Willem Jansoon. He sighted the shores of Cape York Peninsula in 1606. During the 17th century the Dutch settled on the western and northern shores and named the area Nova Hollandia. But they did not try to settle there. In 1770, English Captain James Cook during his Pacific voyage landed on the east coast of Australia and claimed it for Great Britain, naming it New South Wales. His discoveries later led to British convict settlement there. The monarchical colony of New South Wales was founded on January 26, 1788 in Jackson's Department by Arthur Phillip. This day was later named Australia Day as Australia's national day. Settlement in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania) began in 1803 and became a separate colony in 1825.[8] The western part of Australia (the Swan River Settlement) was officially claimed by the United Kingdom in 1829. In 1832 the region became known as Western Australia. The separate colonies of South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859 were separated from New South Wales. In 1911, the Northern Territory separated from South Australia and became a separate state. South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia did not begin as British convict settlements. However, Victoria and Western Australia later began accepting convicts[9] and sent convicts to New South Wales was stopped in 1848 after opposition from settlers.[10] When Europeans first settled here in 1788, approximately 350,000 tribes lived on the continent[11]. At that time 500 types of tribes were living in this continent with their own language. Their numbers began to decline drastically over the next 150 years. Infectious disease, forced resettlement, cultural adjustment etc. are considered to be the main reasons for this [12]. Researchers believe that forced eviction of tribal children from their families is also the reason for this decline [13]. Following a referendum in 1967, the central government was empowered to make policy changes and enact new laws regarding tribals. Native title was not recognized in Australia until 1992. Following the famous Mabo v Queensland case heard in the High Court of Australia, lands under European occupation were previously considered terra nullius (""empty land"") and land titles were given to those who had held the land for generations. Federation During the period 1855 - 1890, the six colonies formed their own governments and began to look after their own local affairs as if they were within the British Empire. The colonial administration based in London was particularly concerned with foreign affairs, defense and international shipping. On 1 January 1901, the Australian Confederation was established. A ""Commonwealth of Australia"" was born within the British Empire. In 1911, part of the state of New South Wales was separated into a separate territory called the Australian Capital Territory, and the capital of the federation, Canberra, was established here in 1927. Until then Melbourne was the temporary capital of the Confederation. The Northern Territory, which was part of South Australia, was separated in 1911 and brought under Central Government. Australia entered the war voluntarily in World War I[14]. Australian participation in the Battle of Gallipoli was the country's first major military engagement. Despite their defeat, the move is seen by most Australians as a national uprising. In the United Kingdom, the Act of Westminster 1931, enacted in 1931, maintained the constitutional relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom, but a 1942 bye-law ended the 1931 Act. The United Kingdom's shocking defeats in Asia during World War II in 1942 and the collapse of the Japanese Empire provided Australia with an opportunity to align with the United States. Since 1951, Australia has had a defense treaty with the United States called Ansus. After the Second World War, people from Europe were allowed to settle in Australia. People from Asia and non-European countries were encouraged to immigrate here from the 1970s after the end of the White Australia policy. After this there was a great change in the heritage, culture, and self-determination of the people of Australia. The constitutional link between Australia and the United Kingdom was further split in 1986 following the passage of the Australia Act 1986. After this act was passed, Britain's role in the Australian states came to an end. An appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom was barred[15]. In a 1999 referendum on Australia becoming a republic, 54 percent voted against. Political Commonwealth Australia is a parliamentary democracy with a middle-class government. Elizabeth II is Queen of Australia. In the interim rule, the Queen has appointed a Governor-General and separate Governors for the respective states on her behalf. Although the Governor-General has many executive powers under the Constitution, he usually exercises his powers on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia. Only once, in 1975, did the Governor-General arbitrarily remove the then Whitlam government[16]. A total of three governmental bodies operate in Australia: Legislature: Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Governor, Senate and People's Representatives are part of it. The Governor-General participates on behalf of the Governor. Executive Council: The Central Executive Council consists of the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet. Law: High Court and Arbitral Tribunals of Australia. Appeals to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom ceased in 1986. The bicameral Parliament of Australia consists of 76 members in the Senate (upper) and 150 members in the House of Representatives (lower). Below Members One member is elected from each constituency. The Upper House has 12 members from each state, two from each of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Elections to both houses are held once in three years. The party with the lowest number of members forms the government. Its leader is elected as the Prime Minister. States and Territories Australia is a self-governing country consisting of six states, two territories and a few other smaller territories. The states are: New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania. The two main regions are the Northern Region and the Australian Capital Territory. Although the functions of the territories are generally similar to those of the states, the constitution of the territories can be changed by the central government (Australian Government). Whereas the Central Government can only change the provisions of Article 51 (Special) Acts of the State Governments. Hospitals, education, police, law, roads, public transport, local government etc. are under the control of state governments. Each state and territory has its own separate assemblies (parliaments). Among these, the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Queensland have one assembly, while other states have two lower and upper assemblies. The head of government of the states is called the Prime Minister and the head of the regions is called the Chief Minister. The Queen appoints a Governor in each state and an Administrator in the Northern Zone as her representative. There are also some smaller territories in Australia. Jervis Island is a naval base located in the state of New South Wales and is administered by the Commonwealth of Nations. In addition to these, the following territories are controlled by Australia: Norfolk Island Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands Ashmore Cartier Islands Coral Sea Islands Hart Island and Macdonald Islands Australian Antarctic Territory Geography Australia is located on the Indo-Australian Plateau surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans and separated from the Asian continent by the Arabian and Timor seas. Covering an area of ​​7,617,930 square kilometers[17], most of the country is desert. Australia's land mass consists of 34,218 km of coastline (excluding islands)[18]. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest barrier reef[19], is found off the northeast coast of Australia. Its length is more than 2000 km. Mount Augustus in Western Australia is considered the world's largest monolith[20]. At 2,228m, Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain in mainland Australia. Mount Mosan is 2,745 m high in the territory of Hart Island and Macdonald Islands off the Peruvian mainland. Australia is the flattest continent. It is the driest of the human-inhabited continents, with old and poor soils. Most Australians live along the southeast coast of the country. The northern part of the country is a tropical region. There are rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, deciduous forests, and deserts. Climate change has become a major issue in Australia in recent times[21]. Although rainfall has increased over the past century[22], much of Australia remains water-scarce. Due to population growth in cities, and local droughts, water restrictions are in effect in many cities[23]. The majority of the population's current (2008) estimated 21.3 million Australians are descendants of people who came from Europe during the colonial and pre-federal period. Most of them are immigrants from the British Isles. Even today, the majority of Australians are of British and Irish descent. Australia's population has quadrupled since the First World War[25]. This strengthened the support for the immigration plan. After World War II, and from then until 2000, nearly 5.9 million people immigrated. That means almost two in seven Australians are foreign-born[26]. Most of the immigrants were skilled in some field[27], although family members and refugees were allowed to immigrate.[27] According to a 2001 estimate, the majority of foreign-born were born in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Vietnam, and China[28]. After the abandonment of the White Australia policy in 1973, several programs were introduced at the government level to promote inter-racial unity based on multiculturalism[29]. In 2005–06, more than 131,000 people immigrated to Australia. The majority of these are from Asia and the changing Oceania regions[30]. In 2006–07 the number of immigrants was estimated at 144,000[31]. 300,000 people are planned to be accommodated during 2008-9. This is the largest number of immigrants since World War II[32]. In 2001 the number of Aboriginal people in mainland Australia (Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) was 410,003. This is 2.2% of the country's total. This is 115,953 more than in 1976. Arrests, unemployment, illiteracy, etc. are the problems faced by the Australian aborigines. Their average life expectancy is up to 17 years shorter than other non-Indigenous Australians[33]. As in other developed countries, Australia's population appears to be aging. More are seen as retirees and a smaller proportion as professionals. The median age of the population in 2004 was 38.8 years[34]. A large number of Australians (759,849 in 2002–03)[35] lived outside their country of birth. Language English is a national language here[36]. The majority speak Australian English. It resembles British English but has some pronunciation and vocabulary unique to Australians. Grammar and spelling are similar to British English. According to a 2001 survey, English was the language spoken at home by 80 percent. followed by Chinese (2.1%), Italian (1.9%), and Greek (1.4%). The majority of immigrants here are bilingual. Around 200 or 300 language-speaking tribes are believed to have lived here at the time of European settlement. Only 70 of these are in the case today. Almost 50,000 (0.25%) people have an indigenous language as their first language. Religion There is no official religion in Australia. According to a 2006 survey, 64% of Australians identified themselves as Christian. Of these, 26% follow Roman Catholicism and 19% follow Anglicanism. 19% identified as not belonging to our religion. 12% did not identify themselves religiously. Christians are followed by 2.1% Buddhists, 1.7% Muslims, 0.8% Hindus and 0.5% Jews. Less than 6% of the total are non-Christian[37]. As in other Western countries, there are few people who go to Christian churches. 1.5 million people attend churches weekly. This is 7.5% of the total population[38]. Education In Australia, schooling is compulsory from age 6 to age 15 (age 16 in South Australia, age 17 in Western Australia, and age 17 in Queensland). This puts the adult literacy rate at 99%. Australia's education system currently ranks eighth in the world[39]. There are a total of 38 state universities here. Besides, there are many private universities which are running on government subsidy. More than these, government technical colleges are running in these states. Education for various industries and professionals is provided here. 58% of Australians aged 25 to 65 have industrial or tertiary qualifications[33]. According to Health 2006 data, the average life expectancy of Australians is 78.7 years for men and 83.5 years for women[40]. Australia has the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world,[41] while tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of death and disease[42]. Australia has the highest prevalence of obesity among developed countries[43]; Meanwhile, Australia is one of the countries that has successfully prevented the spread of AIDS [44][45]. Australian Tamils ​​Tamils ​​began to migrate to Australia from the 1970s. Before that some people have come with work permit. Government estimates indicate that a total of 162 Tamils ​​immigrated to Australia before 1971[46]. The first Tamil to migrate to Australia was Kamal K. Kamaleswaran. The number of Tamil Australians increased from 202 in 1971 to 11,376 in 1991. 60 percent of them are Eelam Tamils. According to government census, the number of Tamils ​​increased to 18,690 in 1996 and 24,067 in 2001[47]. More than 50 percent of them live in the state of New South Wales. Rather than Sri Lanka, they migrated to Australia from countries like India, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, and Fiji in anticipation of opportunities. Culture From 1788, Australia's culture was essentially Anglo-Celtic. However, the natural environment, and the culture of the tribes defined some of Australia's unique cultures. Since the mid-20th century, Australian culture has been heavily influenced by American popular culture (especially television and film), Australia's neighboring Asian countries, and immigration from non-English-speaking countries. The history of Australian painting begins with Aboriginal cave paintings [48]. Australian Aboriginal heritage has been passed down mostly through oral tradition and rituals. Aboriginal music, dance and painting have greatly influenced contemporary Australian culture. Famous painters like Emily Kingwarei and Gordon Bennett belong to the tribe. The National Gallery of Australia and art galleries in many states have collections of local and foreign paintings. Media Australia operates two public television services (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Multicultural Special Broadcasting Service) and three private television services. There are also many private cable, and many non-profit television services. Each of the state capitals publishes separate newspapers. Two newspapers are published nationally. According to Reporters Without Borders' 2008 report, Australia's media freedom is ranked 25th. New Zealand is ranked 7th and the United States is ranked 48th. Such a low rating for Australia is thought to be due to the fact that most of the press in the country is dependent on two large commercial companies, News Corporation and Joan Fairbox[49]. Sport In Australia 23.5 per cent of over 15s engage in some form of team sport [33]. Australia is internationally renowned for sports such as rowing, hockey, netball, rugby league, and rowing and swimming. The 1956 and 2000 Olympic Games were held in Australia. Australia has been among the top six medal winners since 2000[50]. [51] The Australian Open Grand Slam tournaments are world famous in tennis. Biodiversity Although much of Australia is semi-arid or desert, its habitats range from montane to tropical rainforest. Due to factors such as extreme climatic changes and long periods of geographical isolation, Australia's biota is unique and diverse. 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, 45% of birds, and 89% of aquatic species such as fish are unique to Australia[52]. Kangaroo, koala, wallaroo are some of the Australian animals. Australia has the largest number of land animals in the world. There are about 755 species of reptiles[53]. Economy thumbnail|right|Australia's largest gold mine is located in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia The Australian dollar is the currency of Australia. In addition to Australia, it is also the official currency of Christmas Islands, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island, and the Pacific islands of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. Australia has a mixed economic system with Western countries. It was ranked third in the United Nations' 2007 Human Development Index and sixth in The Economist's 2005 World Standard of Living Index. The unemployment rate in Australia in 2007 was 4.6%. GDP is slightly higher than that of the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Also, in The Economist magazine's list of the world's most livable cities (2008), Melbourne was ranked 2nd, Perth 4th, Adelaide 7th, and Sydney 9th [54].

"The Empire State Building, a 102-story Art Deco building in New York City, was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Herrmann Associates in 1930. It has a height of 390 m, up to the observatory on the 102nd floor. The World Trade Center was the tallest building in the city before its construction, which was destroyed in the 2001 attack. It was also the tallest building in the world for many years. Construction was rushed to take the title of tallest building in the world from the Chrysler Building. The building was officially inaugurated on May 1, 1931. Much of its office space remained untenanted until the 1940s. At the top of the observation deck, you can get a spectacular view of the city. It is a popular tourist destination. The top of the building is lit up in different colors at night by fluorescent lights. These colors are chosen according to the times and events. For months following the destruction of the World Trade Center, it was lit up in red, white and blue. Saturday, July 28, 1945 B.C. At 9:49 a.m. a B-25 Mitchell bomber accidentally crashed into the north side of the 79th floor, the National Catholic Welfare Council, killing 14 people. The resulting fire was extinguished within 40 minutes. The Empire State Building has been declared one of the seven wonders of modern times by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It is located at 350 5th Avenue, between 33rd and 34th Streets, in midtown Manhattan. The building is named after New York State's nickname, the ""Empire State"". One of the most famous, popular cultural expressions involving the building in films is the 1933 English film King Kong. In the film, the main character, King Kong, a giant ape, climbs to the top of this building to escape his captors and eventually falls to his death. For the film's 50th anniversary in 1983, an inflatable King Kong figure was placed in the actual Empire State Building. However, it is never fully ventilated. In English films like Love Affair and Sleepless In Seattle, the observatory of this building has been depicted as a meeting place for lovers in the film. The location is also featured in the Martian invasion film I Love Lucy. Thunderbirds, an episode of the science fiction television series Bubbles, depicts an attempt to move the building on rails. Events Air Raid, 1945 Saturday 28th July 1945 B.C. At 9:49 a B-25 Mitchell was flown by William Franklin Smith[1]. Due to heavy snowfall, the aircraft accidentally crashed between the 79th and 80th floors on the north side of the building in unmanageable conditions. Due to the shock of the collision, the engine compartment of the plane hit the next floor. Another part of the plane hit the building's elevator. The fire in the affected parts of the building was extinguished within 40 minutes. However, 14 people died[2][3]. The following Monday, the building resumed operations. A year after the incident, another plane had a similar crash. But due to the tact of the pilot, he diverted the plane[4]. Suicides In 2006, an average of over 30 people committed suicide by jumping from the top of a building [5]. The building's first suicide occurred before its completion. In 1947, five people committed suicide in three consecutive weeks[6]. On May 1, 1947, Evelyn McHull (22) committed suicide from the 86th floor.[7] In December 1943, William Lloyd Rambo committed suicide by jumping from the same platform[8]. On November 3, 1932, only one person, Patrick Eckert, took his own life by jumping from the building's highest floor, the 102nd floor.[8] Suicide Attempts On December 2, 1979, Elvita Adam attempted suicide by jumping from the 86th floor. However, he survived with pelvic fractures[9][10][11]. On April 25, 2013, a man attempted suicide by jumping from the 85th floor. but survived with minor injuries[8]. Gunshots There have been two major shootings in and around the Empire State Building. On February 23, 1997, seven people were shot by a gunman on the 86th floor observation deck of the Empire State Building. A 69-year-old Palestinian teacher, Abul Kamal, killed one person and injured six others in the shooting before committing suicide in what was said to be an act of violence between Israel and Palestine [12]. Jeffrey D. on August 24, 2012 at 9:00 a.m. on the sidewalk next to the fifth gate of the building. Johnson (age 58) shot and killed a former co-worker in 2011 in a fit of rage after he was fired. They confronted the gunman and shot him 16 times. However, nine bystanders were injured in the incident, three of whom were directly hit by the bombs.

"Asia (phonetic) (/ˈeɪʒə/(listen) or /ˈeɪʃə/) is the world's largest and most populous continent. Located mostly in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres, it is part of the Eurasia landmass. 8.7% of the Earth's surface is in Asia. It accounts for 30% of the world's land area. With a population of 3.9 billion, Asia is home to approximately 60 percent of the world's population. Asia's population nearly quadrupled in the 20th century.[3] Asia is generally considered to comprise the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains; It also lies south of the Caucasus Mountains, the Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea.[4][5] Asia is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Indian Ocean to the south, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. The place name Asia is very ancient. Given its scale and diversity, it is not a single physical entity, but rather a cultural concept encompassing diverse regions and peoples.[6] The various regions and peoples of Asia differ greatly in terms of ethnic groups, culture, environment, economy, historical ties, and political systems. DEFINITION AND BOUNDARIES The ancient Greeks were the first to distinguish between the three continents of the Greeks, Asia and Europe. They considered the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles, the Sea of ​​Marmara, the Bosporus, the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, and the Sea of ​​Azov as the boundary between Asia and Europe. The Nile River is considered to be the boundary between Asia and Africa. However, some Greek geographers considered the Red Sea to be a suitable boundary.[7] The Dariuszuk Canal, between the Nile and the Red Sea, was the cause of most of the disagreements. The Don River, where the Black Sea merges, forms the western boundary of Asia. In the 15th century the Red Sea replaced the Nile as the boundary between Asia and Africa. Initially the boundary between Asia and Africa did not reach the Arctic Ocean.[7] However, after the development of country tours, there was a need to redefine this boundary. Emperor Peter the Great of Russia, which straddles the Asia-Europe border, established the Russian Empire in 1721, overcoming Swedish and Ottoman claims to eastern lands and armed resistance from Siberian tribes. This empire extended up to the Ural Mountains and beyond. Thus, the Don River as the boundary between Asia and Africa was not satisfactory to the Northern Europeans. Von Isutralenberg was the most important geographer of the Russian Empire at that time. A Swedish prisoner of war captured at the Battle of Poltava. He was contacted by Peter's Siberian officer, Vasilii Tatischev. He gave me the freedom to do research on geography and anthropology for a future book. In 1730, five years after Peter's death, von Isutralenberg, who had returned to Sweden, published a new map of the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Russians were more enthusiastic about this concept because of their European identity based on geography and other cultural heritage. Tatischev reported that he had made this comment himself to von Izutralenber. Von Isutralenberg suggested that empa should be six as the lower limit. Various proposals emerged throughout the next century. By the middle of the 19th century it was widely accepted that the boundary was Ural. The border moved from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea.[8] Transcaucasia was located within the continent of Asia on maps of that time. As most of the region was later incorporated into the Soviet Union, the idea arose to move the border south. Asia-Oceania Boundary The boundary between Asia and Oceania is placed at a point in the Malay Archipelago. The series ""Southeast Asia and Oceania"", created in the 19th century, has had various geographical meanings since its inception. Oceania, however defined, was never Asia. Which islands in the Malay Archipelago were included in Asia depended on the colonial rights of various empires over these islands. The narrowing of the border to its present state was gradual.”[7] Geography and Climate Asia is the largest continent in the world. Asia covers 8.8% of the world's total surface area, i.e. the largest land area, and Asia also has the largest coastline, with a length of 62,800 km. Asia is bordered by the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains to the east, the Caucasus Mountains, the Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea to the south.[9][4][10] It is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Indian Ocean to the south and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Asia is a continent divided into 48 countries, two of which (Russia and Turkey) are part of the European continent. Asia has diverse climates and geographical origins. The highest daily temperatures in the world are found in the western parts of Asia. Southwest Asia has a warm climate. Places with the highest storm chances are the Philippines and southern Japan in Asia. Mongolia's Gobi Desert and the Arabian Desert extend into the Middle East. The Himalayas, located between Nepal and China, are the world's largest mountain ranges. Climate Change A 2010 survey identified 16 countries in Asia as facing major risks from climate change. The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are among the sixteen countries facing the most problems.

East Asia has the highest human development index in the world. Based on analyzes of progress in health, education and income, the average human development index has doubled over the past 40 years. China, which ranks second in the world in terms of human development index since 1970, is the only country in the top 10 not only in education and health but also in income. China's per capita income has grown 21-fold over the past four decades, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty during this period. However, China has not been among the best developed countries in the region in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.[11] Since 1970, Nepal, a South Asian country, has been a rapidly developing country, especially in terms of the development of health and education. Its current life expectancy is 25 years longer than it was in 1970. More than four out of five school-age boys in Nepal now attend primary schools. 40 years ago it was one in five.[11] Japan and South Korea are ranked 11th and 12th respectively in the world rankings based on the Human Development Index. These belong to the category of highest human development. It is followed by Hong Kong at 21st place and Singapore at 27th place. Afghanistan ranks 155 out of 169 countries assessed, the lowest among Asian countries.[11] Asia is the second largest continent in nominal GDP after Europe. However, it ranks first in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2011, Asia's largest economies include China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Indonesia.[12] Countries and sub-regions and languages ​​in the Asian continent Asia has many language families and distinct languages. Most Asian countries have more than one native language spoken. According to ""Ethnolog"", over 800 languages ​​are spoken in India, over 600 in Indonesia and over 100 in the Philippines. Many languages ​​and sub-languages ​​are spoken in China in its various provinces. Religions Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The Christian Old Testament account of the Great Flood first appears in the Mesopotamian myth of Gilgamesh. According to Hindu mythology, Vitnu's fish avatar warns Manu of a great flood. Almost all Asian religions are philosophical in nature. In addition, the philosophical traditions of Asia include a wide variety of philosophical thought and writings. Includes Indian philosophy, Hindu philosophy, Buddhist philosophy. These include immaterial elements. Whereas in India, there are religions like Sarvakam which emphasize material pleasure. Originating in the Middle East, a part of Asia, Islam is the primary religion in many Asian countries and nearly all Asian countries have significant Muslim populations. Since the colonial period, Christianity has also spread to many Asian countries. Abrahamic Religions Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Baha'iism originated in West Asia. Judaism is the oldest of the Abrahamic religions. It is mostly followed in Israel (which is the homeland of the Jewish people and a place of their historical importance. This country is home to the Jewish people who came here from all over Europe and the people who were there from Asia and Africa).[13] Christianity is also a widespread religion in Asia. Roman Catholicism is a major religion in countries such as the Philippines and East Timor; it was introduced by the Spanish and the Portuguese respectively. The Eastern Orthodox Church is a major denomination in Armenia, Cyprus, Syria and North Asia. Islam, which originated in Saudi Arabia, is the largest and most widely spread religion in Asia. Indonesia is the most Muslim country in the world with 12.7% of the world's Muslim population. And the Asian countries where Muslim is the main religion are Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey. Mecca, Medina and, to a lesser extent, Jerusalem, are considered holy places for Muslims in the world. The Bahá'í Faith originated in Asia and spread from Iran to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Myanmar during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh (English: Bahá'u'lláh). From the middle of the 20th century, this religious tradition took place very slowly in Asia. Because in many Muslim countries, Baka's proselytizing activities were suppressed. Religions in India and East Asian Religions record-setting temple.[14]]] Almost all Asian religions are philosophical in nature. And Asian religions encompass a vast body of philosophical thought and literature. Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in Asia, particularly in the South Asian country of India. Confucianism, Taoism, and Chen Buddhism originated in East Asia, particularly in China and Japan. According to 2012 data, Hinduism is followed by about 1.1 billion people. About 25% of Asia's total population believes in this religion. Hinduism is the second most popular religion in Asia. However, it is the most widely practiced religion in South Asia. More than 80% of people from countries like India and Nepal practice Hinduism. In addition, Hinduism is practiced by people in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali to a significant extent. Hinduism is also practiced by the people in the countries where Indians live, such as Myanmar, Singapore and Malaysia. Buddhism is largely practiced by people in Southeast Asia and East Asia. It is also the most populous religion in these places in many countries. The countries with the highest percentage of Buddhists in terms of population are: Cambodia (96%),[15] Thailand (95%),[16] Myanmar (80%–89%),[17] Saphan (36%–96%), [18] Bhutan (75%–84%),[19] Sri Lanka (70%),[20] Laos (60%–67%)[21] and Mongolia (53%–93%).[22] The highest Buddhist population is Singapore (33%–51%),[23] Republic of China (35%–93%),[24][25][26][27] South Korea (23%–50%), [28] Malaysia (19%–21%),[29] Nepal (9%–11%),[30] Vietnam (10%–75%),[31] China (20%–50%),[32 ] living in North Korea (1.5%–14%),[33][34][35]. There are also smaller Buddhist populations in India and Bangladesh. Jainism is widely and prominently practiced in India. It is also followed to a lesser extent in the countries of Indian diaspora such as America and Malaysia. Sikhism is found in North India and other parts of Asia where most Indians live, mainly in South Asia. Confucianism is widely followed in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, as well as in the Chinese diaspora. Taoism is followed in China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore.

And the Hindu religion, which was born as the essence of many cultures and absorbed the cultures, about its development, the development of the Sramana movement, the decline of the Shiraudha sacrifices, the development and influence of China, Buddhism, Saivism, Vaishnavism and Shakti worship,[2][3] and the royal lineage that lived in the region for two thousand years, Includes information on the origin and influence of empires, the medieval Hindu and Mughal royal dynasties, the later arrival of European traders, the subsequent British Empire, the subsequent independence movement, and the subsequent partition of the country until the birth of the Republic of India.[4] Evidence has been recorded of humans anatomically similar to present-day humans living in the Indian subcontinent around 75,000 years ago, or the ancestors of modern humans as early as 5,00,000 years ago.[5] The first civilization to emerge in South Asia [6] was the Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished in India from 3200 BC to 1300 BC. The Carabba period[7] lasted from 2600 BC to 1900 BC, a civilization that excelled in technology and innovation and was characterized by urban life. It died out at the beginning of the second millennium BC, and was followed by the emergence of the Iron Age Vedic civilization in the Indus-Gangetic plains. It was during this period that many forms of government called Mahasanpadams appeared and developed. From the 5th century BC to the 6th century BC, it was in such a royal dynasty that the Magadhas, Mahavira Gautama Buddha etc. appeared and spread the ""Siramaniya"" philosophy. A large part of the subcontinent was brought under the Mauryan Empire between the 4th century BC and the 3rd century BC. During this period Prakriti and Pali language literature developed in the North and Sangam literature in the South.[8][9] A type of iron called Ootuchu Eku[10][11][12] from South India was exported abroad during this period. For the next 1500 years many parts of India were ruled by many kings, but the Gupta reign stood out during this period. The period of the Guptas is described as the Golden Age of India, as Hindu religion, art, and culture were renewed and revived. During this period, Indian civilization, art, culture, tradition, especially Hinduism and Buddhism spread throughout Asia. By 77 BC, the South Indian kingdoms were in contact with the Roman Empire. The influence and scope of Indian culture spread to many parts of Southeast Asia. Due to this, many kingdoms of Indian origin[13][14] were established in the region. The tripartite rivalry between Pali, Rasitrakudam, and Kurusara Pratikara Empire centered on the Khannosi kingdom was an important event between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. The struggle continued for two centuries. South India was then ruled by the Chalukyas, Cholas, Pallavas, Cheras, Pandyas and the Upper Chalukyas. In the 7th century AD, Mohammedanism emerged as a political force. Its traces were also known in present-day Pakistan, the western part of the Indian subcontinent.[15] The Cholas conquered all of South India and by the 11th century AD [16][17] established a foothold in many parts of South Asia including Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bengal[18]. In the early Middle Ages, Indian mathematics also influenced the astronomy and mathematics of the Arab world. It was then that Indian numbers were also introduced there.[19] The culture of this region further developed as many empires and kingdoms ruled the region. The Achaemenid Empire of Persia [20] lasted from 543 BC to Alexander the Great [21] in 326 BC. The Indo-Greek state, created by Demetrius of Bactria, included such places as Gandaram and the Punjab. This kingdom, which existed in 184 BC, reached its peak during the Menander period. At the same time, the Greco-Buddhist period, which excelled in culture and commerce, also rose. By 77 AD, Kerala had maritime trade ties with the Roman Empire. Islamic rule began in the subcontinent in 712 AD with the arrival of the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim. He conquered Sindh, Multan and South Punjab[22]. This led to several invasions from Central Asia from the 10th century to the 15th century AD, when the Indian subcontinent became an Islamic kingdom. Among them, Ghazni Muhammad, Ghori Muhammad, Delhi Sultans and Mughal empires are famous. The Mughal Empire spread over most of the western parts of the subcontinent. The Mughals brought Middle Eastern paintings and architecture into India. Along with the Mughals, several Hindu kingdoms like the Vijayanagara Empire, the Maratha Empire, the Rajaputra kingdoms flourished in western and southern India. The Mughal Empire automatically lost power in the 18th century after Aurangzeb. As a result, Afghans, Balochians, Sikhs and Marathas easily entered the North West subcontinent. They ruled South Asia until the British East India Company took over.[23] From the 18th century to the following century, the British East India Company gradually brought India under its control. Dissatisfaction with the company's rule led to the Indian War of Independence in 1857. Thus the British government brought India under its direct rule. During this period India saw the growth of society and the decline of economy. In the first half of the 20th century, the freedom struggle started by the Indian National Congress spread like wildfire across the country. The Muslim League also joined itself in this struggle. The subcontinent gained its independence from British rule in 1947, after it was partitioned into two dominions, India and Pakistan. written approach The need to write Indian history was recognized only in the 18th century when the British ruled India. In order to rule India it was imperative to know the way of life, customs and laws of the Indians etc. That prompted the British to focus on it.[24] In response to this, Sir William Jones established the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784.[25] Its aim is to research, understand and document the people living in the low countries, their way of life. Charles Wilkins, H.T. Colebrooke, H.H. Wilson (1786-1860) etc. contributed greatly. Many European scholars, including Max Müller, studied Sanskrit and became proficient in the Vedas. Their writings have been helpful in understanding the Indian civilization and culture, and the history of India has been written by later historians. Similarly, the Christian religious priests, in order to spread their religion, got to know Indian civilization and culture well and campaigned saying that Christianity is more advanced than this. There are those who believe that their thoughts and writings are the cause of the one-sided writing of Indian history. History of British India by John Stuart was published in 1817. The book asserted that Indian culture and civilization were barbaric and hostile to reason. English officers used to learn this book as a lesson during their training before coming to India. This book instilled in them a bad attitude towards Indians. V. A. An English officer named Simith came like this. He wrote a book called The Oxford history of India. But unlike Stuart Mill, Vincent Smith was not so pessimistic about Indians. However, he describes Indians as ungovernable. Indian historians objected to English historians writing the history of India one-sidedly in this way. They explained in many ways about the Indian system of government and its superiority. As a result of this, English historians mostly wrote about emperors and hereditary rule. Apart from the king, they did not give any reference or opinion about any useful political and social institutions. And they wrote history with deep thoughts in their minds that Indian people were living a lazy reactionary life.[26] There is also an opinion that Indian history is not viewed by them with an unbiased approach. Later, many scholars wanted Indian history to be written with its true dimension, and so it has been written.[27] Isolated remains of pre-historic Homo erectus have been found in the Narmada plains of central India. This confirms that the species evolved during the middle Pleistocene, 200,000 to 500,000 years ago, when the ice was frozen.[28][29] But since there are no traces of African migration along the coast of the Indus Ocean, they are considered lost. The Mesolithic period lasted from 25,000 to 30,000 years ago in this subcontinent. More extensive settlements are thought to have existed in the subcontinent during the final stages of the Ice Age, approximately 12,000 years ago. There is evidence that definite permanent settlements existed as early as 9000 years ago. These sources were found at the Bhimpetka Rock Dwellings in present-day Madhya Pradesh. The Mehergar finds in present-day Baluchistan in Pakistan represent the earliest Neolithic culture in South Asia. It is estimated to be around 7000 BC. Although there are obstacles to the existence of this Neolithic period in the Gulf of Kampot, it has also been discovered. Radiocarbon dating dates it to 7500 BC.[30] The culture at the end of the Neolithic period BC. 6000 - 2000 BCE in the Indus Valley Civilization and 2800 - 1200 BCE in South India. This part of the subcontinent has been inhabited for over two million years. It is located in what is now Pakistan.[31][32] The region's ancient history is home to some of the oldest settlements in South Asia[33],[34][35]. One of the earliest archaeological sites to be discovered in South Asia is a Paleolithic Homonit site along the banks of the Sowan River.[36] Village reading life is shown by Neolithic artifacts at Mercerhill.[37] There are also signs of civilizations showing developed urban life like the Indus Valley Civilization[38] at Mohenjadaro, Lothal and Harappa.[39] Bronze Age The Bronze Age began in the Indian subcontinent around 3300 BC, during the early days of the Indus Valley Civilization. It was sourced from the river Indus and its tributaries. It also flourished in the Khakar-Hagra Plain,[34] Ganga-Yamuna, Dob,[40] Gujarat,[41] and western Afghanistan. .[42] This civilization flourished mostly in present-day India (in the regions of Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan) and present-day Pakistan (in the regions of Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan). General Ancient India, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt have the oldest urban civilization in the world. The people who lived in the Indus plains were called Harappans. They invented new ways to make many things with metal. Also, they produced copper, bronze, lead, tin etc BC The Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished between 2600 and 1900 AD, marks the beginning of urban civilization in this subcontinent. Cities like Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rupar, Rakhigarhi, Lothal in present-day India and Harappa, Ganeriwala, Mohenjo-daro in present-day Pakistan are cities with ancient civilizations. In civilization cities were built of bricks; These cities had roadside sewage systems and multi-storey buildings. Vedic Period In the Vedas the river Indus was referred to in two ways: 'Sindu' and 'Hindu'. The Persians changed it to 'Hindu' and the Greeks changed it to 'Indus'. It is from this that the words India and Indian were coined by Indians.[43] Pandit Balakangadhara Tilak has proved that the Vedas were as they are today even before 5000 BC.[44] The Indo-Aryan culture and the Vedas, sacred to Hindus, were the roots of the Vedic period, which were transmitted orally through Vedic Sanskrit. These Vedas are the oldest after the writings found in Mesopotamia, Egypt. This Vedic period lasted from 1500 to 500 BC. It provided a strong foundation for Hinduism and also contributed to the culture of Indian society. The Aryans, who mostly lived in the Gangetic plains, were responsible for the spread of Vedic civilization in Western India. This period was caused by the migration of Indo-Aryans who called themselves Arya(ārya, Aryans). Their civilization was more refined than that of their predecessors, the Dasius, who inhabited the region. The origin of the Aryans is a matter of great controversy. Some claim that they originated from Central Asia and some that they were already living in India before the Hindu Plains Civilization. For this, they refer to a few sentences in the Rig Veda. The theory outside of India states that the Aryans migrated from India to Central Asia and Europe. The Aryan invasions that came in the latter part of the 19th century have changed the theory and scientists have come up with reliable research. In that old Vedic society, which was neglected by the Harappans, the Gurus were the majority. [45] After the Rig Vedic period, the Aryan society was also involved in agriculture. It followed the four Varna Vedas. Apart from the Vedas, which are the source of Hinduism, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were also written during this period.[46] Finds of leather materials confirm the habitation of these Indo-Aryans with yellow clay colored pots.[47] The Kuru[48] kingdoms had black, red and painted gray ware. Also, B.C. The Atharvana Veda, written in 1000, marks the beginning of the Iron Age. It refers to iron as a ferrous metal<i about=""#mwt101"" data-mw='{""parts"":[{""template"":{""target"":{""wt"":""IAST"",""href"":"". /Template:IAST""},""params"":{""1"":{""wt"":""śyāma ayas""}},""i"":0}}]}' data-parsoid='{""stx"":""html "",""dsr"":[27824,27843,null,null],""pi"":[[{""k"":""1""}]]}' lang=""sa-Latn"" title=""International Alphabet of Sanskrit transliteration "" typeof=""mw:Transclusion"">śyāma ayas also claim the distinction of being the first Indian script to date to the Iron Age. This painted gray ware civilization lasted from 1100 to 600 BC in western India.[47] In the latter part of this period we can see the rise of a kingdom called the Mahajanapadas, through a clan system. Mahajanapadas Many Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious literatures indicate that many small kingdoms and city-states began to emerge in the Indian subcontinent during the final phase of the Vedic period. By 500 AD, sixteen monarchies and republics called Mahajanapadas emerged. In this Mahajanapada, the cities of Kashi, Kosala, Anga, Magada, Vachi (Vrichi), Malla, Chedi, Vatsa (Vamsa), Kuru, Panchala, Macha (Matsya), Surasena, Asaka, Avanti, Gandhara, Kamboja in the Indian Gangetic plains are bronze from present-day Afghanistan. and Maharashtra. The Vedic period ranks next after the Hindu Plains Civilization in urbanizing India. Many of the ponds mentioned in early literature were found in this part of the subcontinent. Some of the kings came by way of route, and some were chosen by the cabinet. The common people of western India spoke Prakriti while the educated spoke in Sanskrit. He spoke in tongues. In 500/400 BC, during the reign of Siddhartha Gautama, these sixteen kingdoms came together and transformed into four great kingdoms: Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha.[49] As Hindu rituals were not easy, they were performed by members of the Guru clan. The Upanishads containing the philosophies are believed to have been written during the later Vedic period and the early Mahajanapadas. (ie from 600 to 400 BC). The Upanishads, which dominated Indian philosophies, also spawned Buddhism and Jainism. This was considered a golden age of thought. In 537 BC, Siddhartha Gautama attained Bodhi and was considered enlightened, so he was called the Buddha. Meanwhile, Mahavira (the 24th Tirthankara according to Jainism) theorized a religion that resembled Buddhism. People called it Jainism.[50] The Vedas also mention the organization of sages of the Sramana movement with reference to a few Tirthankaras.[51] The teachings of the Buddha and Jainism brought asceticism to the masses through the language of Prakriti. These two religions, which were related to Hinduism and spiritual principles, spoke of a vegetarian diet, kindness to animals, and the path of ahimsa. While Jainism remained within India, Buddhist monks crossed the country and spread Buddhism in Central Asia, East Asia, Tibet, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Persian and Greek Invasions Most of the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent (present-day eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan) was under the rule of Darius the Great during the Persian Achaemenid Empire. (in 520 BC). The same empire continued for two centuries thereafter.[52] BC In 326 Alexander conquered Asia Minor. And the rule of the Achaemenid Empire in the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent came to an end. Alexander defeated the Buru king at the Battle of Hydachpes (near Jhelum in present-day Pakistan) and conquered the Punjab.[53] He then moved eastward and suppressed the Nanda Empire, Magadha and the Gangarid Empire of Bengal. Fearing that his forces would encounter a much stronger Indian force in time, they abandoned the battle on the banks of the Ganges River at Hyphasis (modern Beas). These Persian and Greek invasions had an impact on the Indian civilization. The political systems of the Persian nation were seen in the Maurya Empire in this subcontinent. The place called Gandhara (present-day eastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan) was the seat of Indian, Persian, Central Asian and Greek cultures. It created a mixed culture of Greco-Buddhism. This form of Mahayana Buddhism dates back to B.C. It lasted until the 5th century. Period of the Mauryans The Mauryan Empire (322–185 BC) was ruled by the Mauryan royal tradition. It was extremely powerful politically and militarily and vast geographically. The Mauryan Empire, founded by Chandra Gupta Maurya, flourished during the reign of Emperor Ashoka. This empire extended from the Himalayas in the west to Assam in the east. In the north, it extended beyond Pakistan and included Balochistan (present-day Herat and Kandahar provinces in Afghanistan). Although Chandra Gupta Maurya and Bindusara conquered parts of central and southern India, Emperor Ashoka conquered a large area of ​​Kalinga inhabited by many undiscovered clans. Old Middle Kingdoms-Golden Age This medieval period was one noted for cultural development. The Satavahanas or Andhras as they were called occupied the Central and South Indian regions from B.C. They ruled in 230. King Satakarni, the sixth in the Satavahana Empire, is credited with defeating the Sunga Empire of Western India. Gautamiputra Satakarani was the supreme king of this empire. The Kulinda Empire in the Himalayas BC. It lasted from the second to the third century. BC In the first half of the first century, the Kushans from Central Asia invaded North West India. Their kingdom extended from Peshawar, the central Gangetic region and the Bay of Bengal, and included ancient Bactria (part of western Afghanistan) and southern Tajikistan. The Sagars who ruled northern and central India were considered the Northern Chatrapathis. (35-405 AD) They lived after the Indo-Sythians and were contemporary with the Kushanas who ruled the western region and the Satavahanas who ruled the southern region. Also [Pandya kingdom, Chola kingdom, Chera kingdom, Kadamba kingdom, Pallava kingdom, Chalukya kingdom, etc., had many empires in South India at various stages. It was as far as South East Asia. These kingdoms fought many wars among themselves and with the central states for power. The Buddhist kingdom of Kalaprara temporarily kept the Chola and Chera Pandya kingdoms under its control. North West Mixed Cultures Mixed cultures like Indo Greek, Indo Scythian, Indo Parthian, Indo Sassanid were found in North West Indian subcontinent.sinids. Indo-Greek Culture The Indo-Pakistani king, Demetrius B.C. It started during the invasion of 1800. Although it lasted for two centuries, the Greek kings who ruled it (about thirty) kept fighting with each other. These Scythians came to India from southern Siberia, via Bactria, Soxtiana, Kasmir, Arasasia, Gandhara. Their kingdom lasted from the middle of the 2nd century to the 1st century. The Indo-Parthians, known as Bagalavas, conquered modern-day Afghanistan and western Pakistan from the Kushans of Gandhara, Kusula Gadbisar, etc. The Sassanid kingdom of Persia lived during the Gupta period. We can clarify that they ruled in present-day Pakistan through the Persian culture there. It can also be said to be the birthplace of the Indo-Sasanid culture. Trade of the Romans with India The Romans started their trade with India in AD. 1 started. This happened after Augustus conquered Egypt. India was Rome's biggest partner in the north. Cysius's Exodus is from B.C. Strabo mentions that he started this trade in 130. (II.5.12.[54]) In Augustan times there was a yearly shipping from Myos Hormos to India, where gold was used in abundance for trade. Later the Kushans also melted down the same gold and used it to print their coins, which Pliny accused (NH VI.101). These trade routes and ports were established in AD. Described in the 1st century. Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Gupta Royal Legacy The Gupta Empire unified northern India in the 4th and 5th centuries. Hindu culture, science and political systems developed during this period, which was considered the golden age of Hindu renaissance. The most famous people in this empire were: Chandragupta I, Samudragupta and Chandragupta II and Kumaragupta I who wrote ancient Puranas. The Gupta Empire came to an end due to the invasion of the Huns from Central Asia. After the end of this empire in the 6th century, many more petty kings ruled India. Even after the collapse of this kingdom, a few members of the Gupta clan continued to rule Magadha. Finally Harshavardhana was the conqueror of this clan. He established his kingdom in the middle of the 7th century. The White Huns, a group of Hephthalites, ruled from their capital at Bamiyan in Afghanistan in the first half of the 5th century. Historians say that they were the cause of the end of the Golden Age because they were the cause of the collapse of the Gupta Empire. However, these controversies did not affect South India and the Deccan. The Middle Kingdoms that arose in later days - the distinctive period India's distinctive period began in the western regions, during the time of the Guptas, and continued during the reign of Harsha Vardhana (7th century). The independent kingdoms in the southern regions came to an end with the Vijayanagar Empire during this period. This is due to the invasions of Western India in the 13th century, during which time India's finest arts flourished. A remarkable development was observed in this. Spirituality and the philosophical systems of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism developed. In the 7th century, Perkindia was united by the Kanapujin king Harsha. This happened after the Guptas. After the death of Harsha, this kingdom also collapsed. From the 7th to the 9th century, three royal lineages competed for power in western India. They were the Pratiharas of Malwa (later Kanapuj), the Palars of Bengal, and the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan region. From the Palarks the Sena kingdom later took over. At the same time the Pratihara kingdom became smaller kingdoms. The Rajputs who came after it continued their rule in India from the whites until the great day of India's independence. As far as we know, the first Rajput kingdom (6th century) was in Rajasthan. After that, small Rajput kingdoms ruled western India. Prithvi Raj Saudan, a Rajput of the Saudan clan, fought valiantly against the Islamic Sultans. Eastern Afghanistan, western Pakistan and Kashmir were ruled by the Sakhi dynasty from the middle of the 7th century to the early eleventh century. Unity with Harsha in western India. Although disappearing, this principle remained intact in the South. 550 - 750 The Chalukya Empire ruled central and southern India from Badami in Karnataka. 970-1190 reigned from Kalyani in the same Karnataka.Contemporaries we may recall the Pallavas of Kanchi.After the end of the Chalukya Empire, their enemies, the Hoysas of Halebid, the Kakatiyas of the Varas, the Suna Yadavas of Devagiri and the southern branch of Kalasuri, divided the Chalukya kingdom among themselves in the middle of the twelfth century. In later times, the Chola Kingdom and the Chera Kingdom arose in the western part of the Tamil country. In 1343, the end of these kingdoms led to the rise of Vijayanagara. These South Indian kingdoms had their dominions across the sea to Indonesia in South East Asia. The ports in South India were involved in trade in the Great Indus Ocean. This trade took place from the Romans in the north to Southeast Asia in the east.[55][56] Vernacular literature and architecture flourished until the arrival of the Delhi Sultans in the fourteenth century. The differences of opinion between these two organizations caused irreparable damage to each other. Vijayanagara lost its power due to the sultans who ruled from Delhi. Archaeologists in India have found that of India's 55,000,000 stone carvings, 55 percent are in Tamil and 60 percent are in Tamil Nadu.[57] Islamic Sultans When the Arabs invaded Persia, India's northern neighbor, they saw India's civilization, diamond mines, and flourishing foreign trade. Although there was a brief struggle, the Islamic Sultans conquered western India. Eventually they brought the western sub-continent under their control, but before the Turkish invasion, the Muslims had trade with the coastal areas of India. Essentially, they came to Kerala from Arabia via the Great Indus Ocean. Thus arose the Abrahamic Middle Eastern religion. It was different from Hindu dharma which was considered sacred in South India. Later Bamini Sultans and Deccan Sultans flourished in South India. Delhi Sultans In the 12th and 13th centuries Turks and Pashtuns invaded western India from the hands of the Rajputs and became the Delhi Sultans.[58] A succession of vassal states based on Delhi later conquered much of western India, as did the Guptas. Although Analkilji ruled over medieval India, they were unable to consolidate this piety. This sultanate brought about a renaissance in Indian culture. It was a mixture of Indian Islamic cultures, architecture, music and religion. It has caused indelible changes in dress. The Urdu language meaning nomad or camp (in Turkish) was born under the Sultans of Delhi. It is due to mixing of Sanskrit Prakrit with Persian, Turkish and Arabic. Delhi Sultanate was one of the few kingdoms to appoint a female ruler. This brought Raziya Sultan to power (1236-1240). In 1398, the Turko-Mongol emperor Timur moved to seize the throne of Sultan Nasiruddin Muhammad, the hereditary ruler of the Delhi-based Tughlaq kingdom.[59] The Sultan was defeated on December 17, 1398. After reaching Delhi, Timur plundered, destroyed and left it in a miserable condition. Mughal Period In 1526, Babur, a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Timur, came through the Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire. It lasted for two hundred years.[60] By the 1600s, the Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent. After 1707 it began to lose its power. It was completely lost due to the Indian War of Independence of 1857 or the Indian Revolution of 1857. This period brought many changes in Indian history. This was the period when the Hindu people were ruled by the Mughal emperors. Most Muslim kings supported Hinduism and its culture. Babur's grandson, Akbar, tended to establish good relations with Hindus, but later kings like Aurangzeb imposed Islamic dominance. Many temples were destroyed due to this. Non-Muslims built huge lines. When the Mughal Empire, which had a vast territory like the Mauryan Empire, lost its power, smaller kingdoms began to come to replace it. The Mughal Empire was a prosperous royal legacy. In 1739, Nader Shah defeated the Mughal army in the Battle of Karnal. Following this victory, Nader Shah captured Delhi and took its wealth to Dhanpal. The Peacock Throne is one of them.[61] At the height of the Mughal period, the political systems of the Mughal empire were very strong, and after that the Maratha kingdoms came out strong to defeat these weakened Mughals. The secret of their long rule was that the Mughals were in harmony with Indian culture. The Sultans of Delhi did not know this secret and soon lost their power. Emperor Akbar was the one who respected and acted. At the time when Jainism was flourishing, Akbar enforced something called Amari, a law against killing Hindu animals. He abolished the Jasiya tax (for non-Muslims). Mughal kings made treaties with Indian kings and married Indian queens, who combined their Turko-Persian culture with Indian styles to create Indo-Saracenic architecture. Forgetting this style, Islamic rule and oppression of the people combined to weaken the empire after Aurangzeb's reign. . Aurangzeb unlike other kings adopted many policies which were not popular with the people. Kingdoms that came after the Mughals The Marathas took their place after the Mughals. At the same time, the activities of the Europeans also increased in India. The Maratha government founded by Shivaji was very powerful during his time. In the 18th century, the Peshwa's rule transformed itself into the Maratha kingdom. By 1760, this empire had planted its flag across the Indian subcontinent. This Maratha expansion was halted by an Afghan force under Ahmad Shah Abdali at the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). The last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Mysore is a small state in South India. It is in AD. In 1400, the Wadiyar kingdom was established by the heirs. The rule of the Wadiyars came to an end with Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. Aidar Ali and Tipu Sultan were oppressed by the Anglo-Mysore wars, and the Mysore kingdom became a tributary Swadeshi principality to the British. engaging Hyderabad was founded in 1591 by Qutb Sahi of Golconda. After Mughal rule under a minor Asif Jah, Nizam Ala Malak of Hyderabad again took power in 1724. From 1724 to 1948, Hyderabad was ruled by descendants of the Nizam of Hyderabad. Mysore and Hyderabad became monarchies in British South India. The Punjabi Kingdom, formed by a minority of Sikhs, ruled the Punjab politically. This region was one of the last areas to be conquered by the British. Anglo-Sikh wars led to the dissolution of the Sikh Kingdom. Nepal was created in the 18th century by Gorkha, Shah and Rana rulers. They protected themselves and lived in harmony. Chera Empire The Chera Empire was one of the 3 empires that ruled ancient Tamil Nadu. The Chera Empire was a region that included most of present-day Kerala and parts of Tamil Nadu. The main port is Musiri. Marco Polo mentioned in his book that in the first century Tamil Nadu had good trade communication with Rome through the port of Musiri. Chola Empire There are two important kings in the Chola Empire, 1. Rajaraja Chola, 2. Rajendra Chola. During their rule, the Chola Empire flourished and expanded. The Cholas were one of the three clans that ruled Palandmilnad. The other two clans are Cheras and Pandyas. It is not known how the name Cholar came to be given, but the scholar Parimelazagar thought that Cholar was the name of a family or clan that had been ruling since ancient times, like the names Cherar and Pandyar. Although Chera, Chola and Pandyar are said to be brothers, this is a tradition and has no historical basis. However, the areas and people under the rule of the kings of the Chola dynasty have been referred to by this name since ancient times. The Chola clan originated in the fertile Cauvery river basin. Vasco da Gama discovered the route to India by sea in 1498 when the Pandya Empire established the country's settlement.Thus the Indo-European trade flourished.[62] The Portuguese established their trading posts in Goa, Diu, Daman and Bombay, followed by the Dutch and the British who established trading posts on the northern coast of Surat.[63] The French followed them in 1619. The internal wars and chaos provided the entry point the Europeans were looking for. Through this they also started exerting political dominance. All other European countries lost their territories to the British eventually, that is, in this same century. Exceptions to this were the French ports of Pondicherry, Chandernagore and the Dutch port of Travancore, and the Portuguese ports of Goa, Daman and Du. ஆங்கிலேயர் அரசாட்சி ஆங்கிலேய கிழக்கிந்திய நிறுவனம் முகலாய பேரரசர் ஜெஹாங்கிரின் அனுமதிப் பெற்ற பிறகு இந்தியாவுடன் 1617 ல், வணிகம் கொள்ள ஆரம்பித்தது[64] நாளடைவில் அவர்களது ஆதிக்கத்தினால் சட்டப்படி (டி-சூரே ) இருந்த முகலாய பேரரசர் பருக் சியார் அவர்ர்களுக்கு தஸ்டக்குகள் அல்லது வரியில்லாமல் வங்காளத்தில், 1717 ல், வாணிகம் செய்ய அனுமதி வழங்கினார்.[65] வங்காள மாகாணத்தை தனது வம்சாவளியின் (டி-பாக்டோ ) மூலம் ஆண்ட, வங்காளத்தின் நவாப் சிராஜ் உத் தௌலா ஆங்கிலேயரரின் இந்த முயர்ச்சிக்கு எதிர்ப்பு தெரிவித்தார். இது 1757 ல் பிளாசே போருக்கு வழி வகுத்தது. இதில் இராபர்ட் கிளைவின் தலைமையில் சென்ற கிழக்கிந்திய நிறுவனத்தின் படை நவாபை வீழ்த்தியது. நிலங்களை அரசியல் நோக்குடன் ஆங்கிலேயர்கள் ஆக்கிரமித்ததில் இதுவே முதல் முறை.இந்த நிறுவனம் கிளைவை முதல் வங்காள ஆளுநராக 1757 ல் நியமித்தது.[66] 1764 ல் பக்சார் போருக்கு பின்னர் வங்காளத்தை ஆட்சி செய்ய முகலாய பேரரசர் ஷா அலாம் II இடமிருந்து அனுமதிப்பெற்றது. இதுவே இந்தியா முழுதும் ஆங்கிலேயரின் ஆட்சிக்குள் வர முதல் படியாக இருந்தது.3}[113] வங்காளத்தின் வணிகத்தை தான் மட்டுமே கையாண்டது பிரித்தானிய கிழக்கிந்திய நிறுவனம்.அவர்கள் ஒரு புது நில வரியை அறிமுகப்படுத்தியது. பெர்மனென்ட் செட்டில்மென்ட் என்ற இதன் வழியாக நிலங்கள் பியூடல் முறையில் கையாளப்பட்டன.

It is also called the first war of Indian independence. After a year, the British were able to control this League only after taking great measures. Thus the Mughal dynasty itself was abolished. Due to this the British Monarchy transferred the responsibility of governing India Company to itself. It is seen as a settlement in India. It ruled overtly the lands under the company and covertly ruled the other lands under the guise of sovereign states. After independence from the British in August 1947, India had a total of 565 princely states.[70] Indian Independence Movement Indian Councilors were appointed to advise the British Viceroy. This was the first step towards Indian independence and Northern-style republicanism.[71] By being appointed to state councils, councilors also involved themselves more in legislative councils.[72] From 1920, leaders like Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi initiated people's movements against the British. Subhash Chandra Bose, a great freedom fighter leader, joined forces against the British. Another freedom fighter leader named Bhagat Singh was responsible for making revolutions in the Indian freedom struggle. He is known as Shaheed Bhagat Singh. Shaheed means principled. The first freedom fighter, Katalangulam warrior Agumumuthu Khon refused to pay the line and fought against the British commander Khansagi and raised his voice against the government. His blood was the seed of the Indian freedom struggle. Veerapandiya Kattabomman was one of the freedom fighters. The activities of the Revolutionary Movement for the Independence of India against the British also took place in the Indian subcontinent. All these movements contributed to the independence of India in 1947. Independence and Partition Historians believe that the British government tried to portray its colonial rule as a peaceful Christian policy against Islam by studying the Mohammedan rule and the destruction it caused and highlighting the problems between Hindu Muslims. Since many factors other than religion determined the rule, the research historians do not agree with the method of referring to 'Hindu rule' and 'Mohammedan rule'.[73] In this way, at the same time as the Indian freedom movement, the problems between Hindus and Muslims also developed. In 1915, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi tried to bring unity between the two sides. The British voted ""Quit India"". All parts of India gained independence in 1947. British India was divided into Pakistan and India. After the partition of India, before and before the partition of Punjab and Bengal, a riot broke out between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims. It happened in major parts of India namely Punjab, Bengal and Delhi. Nearly 500,000 people died.[74] At the same time, a massive migration of people took place to the extent that history is surprising. Out of this 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims migrated to newly formed India and Pakistan.} After independence On 15 August 1947, the first Indian government was formed after India's independence under the leadership of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. India became a republic on 26 January 1950, the same day as the Constitution of India. In 1951-1952, the first general election to the Parliament of India was held. Due to Vallabhbhai Patel's great efforts, 562 monarchical countries were annexed to India. In 1960, Indian states were organized into linguistic states. Gandhi, the father of India, was shot dead on January 30, 1948 after India's independence.

"Natural disaster (English<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[242,262,2,2]}'>Natural disaster) or Perungedu refers to the damage caused to the environment by natural disturbances. (For example, floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, etc.), these disasters cause massive damage to property, loss of life, and untold damage to the environment. It is not easy to endure the great disaster caused by this, even if its traces make the affected people suffer and suffer for a lifetime, in a way, the recovery activities of these stages are very dependent on the quick actions taken by the people and society of the country, and it is the best and clearest way to bring the environmental conditions back to the old condition. Not only that, it is very important for people to act with self-confidence and self-confidence in order to recover from disaster and fight it. The support of the people, the constructive actions they take efficiently and quickly, working in unison without being nervous, everyone giving their part regardless of the time and working regardless of the difficulties, it is possible to keep the situation under control to some extent, and it is possible to reduce the problems and impacts to some extent.[1] The basic statement that we need to understand is this: ""Like a raging wind that uproots a banyan tree, so too many perils, when they occur simultaneously and in succession, multiply disastrously and breed disaster.""[2] Natural hazards are seen to lead to disasters only when they occur excessively in certain vulnerable locations, for example, severe earthquakes do not occur in uninhabited areas. The term nature itself in this context is later debatable, arguing that all disasters, disruptions, or threats would only make sense if humans were involved.[3] In other words, humans may not know or care about what happens in uninhabited places. Natural Hazards A natural hazard is a phenomenon that represents hazards or threats that have the potential to affect the people and the environment with negative consequences. Many natural disturbances are interrelated, for example, tsunamis can occur due to earthquakes, droughts can directly result in famine|famine and plague|plague. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was a disaster, but the disruption of earthquakes in general is a strong example of the distinction between disaster and risk. Disturbances are related to future events that will occur later, while disasters are related to past events or current events. Natural Disasters Landslide Disasters Avalanche Notable glacier slides are: The collapse of the Wellington Glacier in 1910 1954 Plons Glacier Collapse 1970 Ankash Earthquake 1999 Kaldur glacier collapse 2002 Kolka-Karmadon rock avalanche Earthquakes Earthquakes are sudden, unexpected movements in the Earth's crust. Its vibrations vary greatly. The place under the ground which is the cause of the earthquake is called 'Focus'. The point directly above the focus is called the 'resonance center'. When such earthquakes occur, they do not affect people or animals. Due to earthquakes, secondary events such as collapse of buildings, spread of wildfires, generation of tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, etc., also cause catastrophic human losses. Construction of strong buildings, implementation of better security systems, early warning, planning and implementation of pre-evacuation measures can be done to prevent or avoid such catastrophic risks to some extent. Hence the claim of non-natural disaster is legally untenable. Earthquakes are caused by natural events that dislodge all of the tectonic faults at once rather than clustering together. Some of the most notable earthquakes in recent times are: The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was the second largest earthquake on record, with a magnitude of 9.3 at the time. More than 229,000 people died as a result of the massive tsunami triggered by the earthquake. The 2005 Kashmir earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.6-7.7, killed 79,000 people in Pakistan. The July 2006 Java earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 accelerated the tsunami. Likewise, the Sichuan earthquake of magnitude 7.9 on May 27, 2008 occurred in the Sichuan region of China. More than 61,150 died on May 27, 2008. Lahars A lahar is a volcanic mudflow or landslide. Hence landslides also occur. In 1953 the 'Tangivai Disaster' was caused by a lahar. Similarly, during the Armiro Great Tribulation, the entire city of Armiro was buried and 23,000 people died. Landslides and mudslides are a regular occurrence in California after heavy rains. Volcanic Eruption A volcanic eruption can be catastrophic, or igneous (volcanic) rock falls can also be catastrophic. When such excess explodes, many consequences appear, and it threatens human life. When a volcano erupts and causes a catastrophic eruption, 'lava' is released. It also contains superheated underlying rocks. There are different forms of it, soft granular and viscous. When it erupts from the volcano, it destroys all buildings and plants in front of it. Volcanic ash – as it is commonly referred to – forms an ash cloud as it cools and settles in nearby areas. When mixed with water, it becomes a lumpy substance like 'thingarai'. In large enough quantities such ash can collapse the roof itself under its own weight. Just a little breath is enough to completely affect the health of the body. Due to the presence of powdered glass in the ash, moving internal parts like the engine will rub and get damaged. The Great Volcanic Mountains: According to the Toba catastrophe theory, a great volcanic eruption at Lake Toba 70 to 75 thousand years ago reduced the population to ten thousand people or a thousand reproductive pairs, creating a dilemma in human evolution. It also wiped out three-quarters of the plant species in the northern hemisphere. Ash spewed by the great volcano is rapidly spreading like a magma and has the potential to affect global warming for centuries. The hot springs that flow from the fruit rock fragments are filled with volcanic ash. It penetrates the gas system and spreads out, burning up everything it encounters in its path as it expands by both its weight and energy. A hot spring from a volcanic fragment is believed to be the main cause of Bombay's total degradation. Disasters caused by floods Floods Some of the most notable floods that have affected people in the historical records are: China's famous Yellow River, known as the Huang Ha, is famous for its frequent floods. Between 800,000 and 4,000,000 people died in the worst flood of 1931. The Great Flood of 1993 in the United States was one of the most devastating and devastating floods in history. In 1998, the Yangtze River floods in China were a major disaster, affecting fourteen million people and leaving them homeless. The Mozambique floods of 2000 completely submerged large parts of the country for over three weeks, leaving the country in a state of degradation and insecurity for several years. Cyclonic storm surges in the tropics have caused extensive flooding in many places, as follows: Cyclone Bola was the worst hit in East Pakistan|Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1970. Typhoon Nina hit China in 1975. Tropical Cyclone Allison hit Houston, Texas in 2001. Hurricane Katrina completely submerged New Orleans in 2005. Due to the failure of proper construction of levees, excessive floods occurred in the state and destabilized the state. Bursting of the lake The bursting of the lake causes flooding. Its cause is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (CO)2']] erupts from the depths of the lake and gushes out, causing wildlife, livestock and humans to suffocate due to lack of breathing gas. There is a possibility of a tsunami in the lake due to the displacement of the water in the lake and the release of carbon dioxide gas. Scientists believe that such lake eruptions accelerate the reactions of landslides, volcanic eruptions or eruptions. To date, only two lake eruption events have received attention. In 1984, an eruption at Lake Monaun in Cameroon killed 37 people who lived nearby. A major eruption in nearby Lake Nyos in 1986 left 1,700 to 1,800 people asphyxiated. Tsunamis 'Cataclysms' In-sea earthquakes can become tsunamis, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake in Ao Nung, Thailand, Alaska, sometimes triggered by landslides Events: Lituya Bay, Alaska. Ao Nung, Thailand (2004). In 2004, an Indian Ocean earthquake triggered a Boxing Day tsunami that wreaked havoc in the area. Litua Bay, Alaska (1953). A huge tsunami happened here. It was the largest event on record. It's the kind that the earthquake table falls into, because it started with earthquakes. Weather Disasters Blizzards Major blizzards in the United States include: The Greatest Blizzard of 1888 The schoolhouse was blown early by a blizzard that same year. [[armichtise day Ice Cyclone|Armistice Day Blizzard]] 1940 Event 1993 Storm of the Century Hurricanes, cyclones, tropical cyclones, ionospheric storms, hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons are all rare natural phenomena. All hurricane storms occur over the ocean floor. Hurricane Bola in 1970 was more severe than the Atlantic hurricane in 1780 that hit Martinique, St. Eustatius and Barbados. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States. Droughts that have affected people the most in recorded history include: A drought that hit India in 1900 - killed 250,000 to 3.25 million people. Soviet Union droughts of 1921-22 - starved to death of 5 million people. In 1928-30 Northwest China was devastated by drought, and more than 3 million people died of famine. In 1936 and 1941 Sichuan province – in China – had 5 million and 2.5 million deaths respectively. In 2006, the Australian states of Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Victoria and Queensland all suffered five to ten years of drought. For the first time, drought hit the urban population hard. In 2006, Sichuan Province experienced one of the worst droughts in modern China. Eight million people, and seven million cattle all perished for want of water. Hailstorms are also called 'hail' rains because they form into ice when rainstorms or hailstorms fall. Areas particularly affected by blizzards: Munich, Germany August 31, 1986, thousands of trees fell. and received multi-million dollar insurance payouts. Heat waves The worst heat wave in recent history was the European heat wave of 2003. In 2009, a massive bushfire ignited in Victoria Australia during a heatwave event. Melbourne experienced over three days of extreme heat, with temperatures exceeding 43°C. Spiral curves Different types of spiral curves: Supercell vortices Supercell vortices are extremely violent vortices. As it accompanies thunderstorms, the supercell vortex can continue to spin the vortex or air rapidly upward with prolonged periods of thunder. These storm winds are mostly vortices in nature. In this way a few airs are arranged majestically in the shape of a large wedge. A supercell collapses when the dam or bridge hangs below it. It is called ""wall cloud"". It looks like layered stone. The cloud is positioned with its underside appearing as if it is engulfing the bottom. One side of the bridge is devoid of rain and the other side appears as a thick arrow or spear of rain. A supercell's rotating upper surface appears in radar illusions, giving it the name ""inner cyclone"". When a supercell comes together with thunderstorms, the winds stay in contact with the ground for an hour or more! Like other typhoons, the intensity is very high. So it blows at a speed of two hundred miles per hour. A landmass is generally weaker than a landmass supercell cyclone. Along with it, the wall cloud and the inner vorticity are not accompanied. Mughal piles are like towers. It can probably be found under Tirala Carmugil. That landmass is a phenomenon equivalent to the watermass of a place. It forms at the leading edge of the front of a thunderstorm that is cooled by the rain and is moving downwards, and is called a ""front"". Tornado A cyclone lasts for a short period of time without strengthening. In a storm, the storm front is characterized by dirt and dust deposits that temporarily reach the front. Although no clear interaction or rotation law is observed with the buoyant mold, these appear as particle ghosts. A water table appears as a table when a vortex blows over the water. A few supercells emerge from the storm. But many also originate from weakened thunderstorms or from rapidly developing thunderstorms. As the water bodies are less energetic, the damage will be less. As Katha Katha appears at any time in the waters of the Ayan sea about fifty yards wide. In its smoke mouth, pure water droplets can be found denser as water vapor liquefies, and it does not contain salt water. Water droplets usually disperse when they reach the ground. When they reach land, water bodies lose their energy and disappear. The following are typical of whirlwinds like hurricanes. Particle traps In the desert or arid land, particle swarms occur on clear, warm days. The heat of the sun is moderate. Appearing in the late morning or early afternoon, these are mostly harmless desert breezes with whirlwind speeds, sometimes reaching speeds of seventy miles an hour. Internally these vortices are multidimensional. Also, winds do not mix with thunderstorms. The cloud will not be with you. Usually it is weak. It will be like a weak whirlwind. When classified it has a life cycle of a few minutes, sometimes longer. Although they do not cause much harm, they are capable of causing small amounts of damage. They attack all carts and vehicles running on the roads. It also brings dust in the eyes of the beholders. Fire eddies Sometimes wildfires that spread through forests or volcanic eruptions create fire eddies. It spews heat and smoke as it blows around. This occurs when there is a weak vortex or eddy in the air above the fire. Winds that swirl with the fire are estimated to blow at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. They are sometimes called firestorms, fire demons, or fire vortices.[4] Uncontrolled fires appear to be widespread in forested areas. The common causes of these occurrences are: lightning and drought, but the carelessness of men, and when riots and quarrels occur, the flames burn and surround them. Not only in rural areas, but also in densely forested areas, they pose a threat. A notable out-of-control wildfire was the 2009 Victorian bushfire on the island continent of Australia. Epidemics of Health and Illness Communicable diseases can spread rapidly and rapidly through human populations. Pandemic infections are those that spread rapidly around the world. There have been many contagions throughout history. Chief among them is the Black Death. Important epidemics in past centuries include: The Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 is estimated to have killed 50 million people worldwide. The ASEAN plague epidemic of 1957-58 claimed an estimated one million lives. The Hong Kong Plague Epidemic of 1968-69 2002-3 Sars epidemic The AIDS epidemic began in 1959 H1N1 Influenza Swine Flu Pandemic 2009 Other diseases spread more slowly. But they are considered international health risk crises by the World Health Organization. XTR TB is a subtype of tuberculosis. Resistance to drug therapies is a widely acquired type of resistance. Malaria kills an estimated 1.5 million people every year. 'Ebola hemorrhagic' fever has repeatedly struck Africa and claimed hundreds of lives. Famine Famines in modern times have plagued parts of the sub-Saharan African continent. Famine is extremely severe. The death toll was less than the 20th century Asian famines! The largest event in modern times resulting from cosmic 'gamma' ray bursts was the 'Dunguska event' in June 1908. Solar flares Solar flares are a rare phenomenon. Then the sun emits its maximum radiation. It is higher than the normal range. Days on which such solar rays appear: A few solar flares: The X-20 event took place on August 16, 1989 Similarly, Kalaroli occurred on April 2, 2001 The most powerful eruption occurred on November 4, 2003, with magnitudes of X40 and X45. September 1859 was the most powerful solar flare ever recorded in the last 500 years. Supernova and hypernova stars are future natural disasters UK-based charity Oxfam has warned that a total of 375 million people could be the target of heat-related illnesses by 2015.[5] Insurance Natural disasters play a very important role in the insurance industry. It finances certain destructions in return for damages. (Hurricanes, wildfires, etc.) Major insurance companies are compensating for other major losses.[6] Notes External links CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) World's scariest in history A list of disasters is included. * ",How many people died in the 1918 pandemic?,50 million,18219
"The India Meteorological Department (IMD), or Meteorological Department for short, is a department under the Ministry of Geology, Government of India. It is the premier agency for meteorological observations, weather forecasting and seismology. Its head office is located at Lodhi Road in New Delhi. It operates hundreds of weather observatories across India; It also has a research center in Antarctica. It is also one of the six regional special meteorological centers of the World Meteorological Organization. Its responsibilities include weather forecasting, naming and issuing of warnings for tropical cyclones in the northern Indian Ocean region including the Straits of Malacca, Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf. History In 1686 Edmund Ely published a treatise on the monsoon winds during the Indian summer; He proposed that this seasonal wind shift is due to the differential heating of the Asian landmass and the Indian Ocean region. The British East India Company was the first to establish meteorological stations in India; In 1785 the Calcutta Observatory was established, in 1796 the Madras Observatory and in 1826 the Colaba Observatory. In the first half of the 19th century, many meteorological stations were established by the provincial governments throughout the country. The Asiatic Society established in Kolkata in 1784 and Mumbai in 1804 promoted meteorological studies in India. Annie Piddington published 40 papers on tropical cyclones between 1835 and 185 in the society's Calcutta journal. He coined the English word cyclone; Meaning snake coil. In 1842 he published his famous theory of the Laws of Storms.[2] After a tropical cyclone hit Calcutta in 1864 and subsequent famines between 1866 and 1871 due to failure of monsoons, plans were made to consolidate meteorological data and analysis under one department. The Indian Meteorological Department was established in 1875 to implement this. Francis Planford was appointed as its first announcer. In May 1889, John Elliott was appointed as its first Director-General in the then capital, Calcutta. The headquarters of the Indian Meteorological Department were shifted to Shimla in 1905 and to Pune in 1928. Finally in 1944 its headquarters was shifted to New Delhi.[3] It became a member of the World Meteorological Organization on 27 April 1949 after India's independence.[4] The sector has gained special attention due to the impact of monsoon on Indian agriculture. The department plays an important role in estimating the annual monsoon rainfall and monitoring the distribution of monsoon across the country. [5] organization The Director General of Meteorology is the head of the Indian Meteorological Department. Now a renowned agro-meteorologist, Ph.D. Lakshman Singh Rathore holds this post. The department has six Zonal Meteorological Stations headed by the Deputy Director General. These are located in Chennai, Guwahati, Kolkata, Mumbai, Nagpur and New Delhi. Besides, meteorological stations have been established in every state capital. Forecast offices, agrometeorological advisory service centers, flood warning offices, and human cyclone warning centers are located at these centers.[6] It also places instruments on the ground, glaciers, high altitudes, and stratospheres to obtain meteorological data. Meteorologists operate radiographic stations to monitor cloud conditions. Additional data is also obtained by instruments on Indian satellites such as Kalpana-1, the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite and the Indian National Satellite Module satellites.[7] Indian Navy receives weather data from ships and Indian merchant ships. Seismological monitoring centers are also being operated at necessary places to measure and monitor ground tremors. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology works in coordination with agencies such as the National Center for Intermediate-Range Weather Forecasts and the National Oceanic Institute.

"Latin America (Latin America, Spanish: América Latina or Latinoamérica, Portuguese: América Latina, French: Amérique latine, Italian: Latijns-Amerika) refers to the regions of the Americas where Romance languages ​​are prevalent. Spanish, Portuguese and French are widely spoken here[3][4]. Its total area is approximately 21,069,500 square kilometers. It accounts for 3.9 percent of the total Earth's surface area and 14.1 percent of the land area. It has a population of 59 crore as of 2013[5]. And its gross domestic product is 7368 billion[6]. Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela are part of Latin America. History Early history of colonialism The oldest signs of human habitation in Latin America are found in southern Chile. These are around 14000 years old. The first settlement after this was the Las Vegas culture[7]. It occurred in Ecuador between 8000 and 4600 years ago. Subsequently, tribal settlements were established in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. Later, many civilization groups emerged in the American regions of the land. Among them were the Aztecs, Taltecs, Caribs, Tubi, Maya and Inca groups. The Aztecs were especially dominant in Latin American regions. Their rule ended with the arrival of the Spanish in America. European colonization Since Columbus reached the Americas in 1492, European colonial domination of Latin America began. A Spanish force led by Hernán Gutés besieged and destroyed Aztec cities in North America. Similarly, an army led by Francisco Pizarro conquered and destroyed the Inca Empire in South America. This brought North and South West America under the control of the Spanish Empire. In the creation of further settlements, the border line between the two colonies was determined in 1494, following a dispute between Spain and Portugal. With this, the northern and western coasts of Latin America were brought under the Spanish Empire and the eastern coast under Portugal. Following them, Britain, France, and Holland, which were to be replaced, invaded America and established their colonies there. By the end of the sixteenth century, all of the Americas from Alaska to Chile had been converted into European colonies. Destruction of tribes Native American culture was crushed by successive colonizations and European culture spread. Roman Catholicism is the undeclared state religion. The Catholic Church was very powerful in terms of administrative and economic power. Through this, the religious rights of the American tribes were denied and they were forced to convert to Christianity. And large numbers of tribes died from plagues such as smallpox and measles brought by Europeans. The details of the number of such deaths are not available today. However, it is believed that 25% to 85% of the total tribal population may have died. The rest of the tribes were forced to work in the mines of the colonialists. Through the interbreeding that took place during this period, a new European-American mixed breed called the Mesutoso began to emerge. The Mezudos were the majority in Latin America in the late nineteenth century, when colonialism ended. Liberation struggle Following a slave revolt led by Toussaint Louverseur in Haiti in 1804, the country gained independence from France. Subsequently, slavery was abolished in that country and independence was established. This was the impetus for liberation struggles in other Latin American countries. Towards the end of the eighteenth century revolts against Spanish rule began to appear. Hispanics born in the mother country were categorized as upper caste, while Hispanics born in Latin America were classified as criollo or lower caste. This was the impetus for the liberation war there. Miguel Cosudilla, Simón Bolívar, and José San Martín rallied people in Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina respectively to fight for independence. Although the popular uprising was initially suppressed by the government troops, the popular struggle was further strengthened by the younger generation of generals such as Simón Bolívar and Jose San Martín. As a result of successive uprisings, by 1825 all Spanish colonial territories except Puerto Rico and Cuba had become independent. In 1822 a constitutional monarchy was established in independent Brazil. In the same year, the monarchy was established under the leadership of Augustin the Dubite, the military commander of Mexico. However, it was soon dissolved and the Republic of Mexico was born in 1823. Lineage of people Ethnic groups Latin America is a region with many ethnic origins. The distribution of these species varies from country to country. Native Americans, Asians, Africans, Mezudos (European-Native American mixed race), Mulattos (European-African mixed race), Europeans (especially Spanish and Portuguese), and Sambos (Native American-African mixed race) are most common in Latin America. . Language Spanish and Portuguese are both the most spoken languages ​​in Latin America. 60% of the total population speaks Spanish, 34% Portuguese, and 6% other languages ​​such as Quechua, Mayan, Guaraní, Aymara, Nagavalo, English, Italian, French, and Italian. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil. Spanish is the official language in all other Latin American countries except it. Spoken in French, Haiti and Guyana. Native American languages ​​are most widely spoken in Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Mexico. It is also spoken in significant numbers in Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Chile, and much less widely in other countries. Compared to other countries, Mexico has a large number of indigenous language speakers. Uruguay is the only Latin American country without an indigenous language case. religion Christianity is the majority religion in Latin America[8]. 70% of them are Roman Catholics. In Brazil, Panama and Venezuela, the Reformed Church has a steady growth. Apart from this, the tribal faith, Judaism, Islam etc. are practiced by a small number of people. Culture Latin American culture is a cultural blend of Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans. There is a lot of indigenous ways of culture and lifestyle and European influence in religion, art, painting etc. Music and dance are synonymous with African culture.

"Isaac Newton (December 25, 1642 – March 20, 1727)[5] was an English mathematician, scientist, and philosopher. Newton did a lot of research in the fields of science, mathematics, mechanics and gravity. He was one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the Scientific Revolution. In 1687 he published Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which included explanations of gravity. Through his laws of motion, he spawned the field of classical mechanics. Along with Wilhelm Leibniz, Gottfried contributed to the development of the field of differential calculus. It was in Newton's Principia that the laws of motion, general gravitation, that dominated the cosmologist's view of physics for the next three centuries were formulated. It explained that the motions of objects on Earth and the motions of objects in space such as planets can be explained on the basis of the same principles. Newton built the first practical telescope and developed a theory of color based on the observation that a triple-glass splits white light into a spectrum of many colored lights. He also studied the speed of sound. Apart from his studies in micromathematics, as a mathematician he also contributed to studies of exponential series. Young Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day (December-25) 1642 in Woolsthorpe, near Colsterworth, Lincolnshire, England, to an average farming family. His father died three months before his birth. After two years, the mother moved in with her new husband, leaving Newton in the care of his grandmother. Education Newton attended Grantham Grammar School. Initially he did not concentrate well in his studies. But once he made fun of a boy older than him who made fun of him, he gained confidence and started studying well. Newton had an interest in science from an early age, and at an early age he built a clock that worked in water. He was forced to drop out of school when he was fourteen due to family poverty. In 1661, his uncle, aware of Newton's desire for education, admitted him to the prestigious Trinity College, Cambridge. The teaching of the college at that time was based on Aristotle. But he also wanted to learn the concepts of modern philosophers of the time like Newton, Descartes, Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler. In 1665, he discovered the Binomial Theorem and began to develop a new mathematical theory, later known as micromathematics. After he graduated in 1665, the university was closed due to the Great Plague. He spent the next two years at home studying micromathematics, optics, and gravity. Newton graduated with honors in 1665. There are not so many references to his university days. But within two years of his graduation, his scientific brain began to function at an exponential rate. He invented various elements of modern mathematics. Generalized binomial theorem, infinitesimal calculus and other sections of modern mathematics were invented by him. He devised methods for finding the area of ​​curved objects and the volume of solid objects. Career In 1667, at the age of 25, Newton was appointed professor of physics at Trinity College. He was awarded an honorary degree at Trinity College. He spent the next few years full-time in various researches. He studied the nature of light and focused on developing telescopes. In one year he also built a telescope. Through it he could see the moons of Jupiter Gol. Today's modern telescopes are based on Newton's first telescope. In 1669, Newton became professor of accounting at Trinity College. He was subsequently inducted into the prestigious Royal Society. Inventions He was the first to explain the laws of nature that govern geospatial and space motions. He was associated with the Scientific Revolution and the development of the heliocentric theory. Newton was also instrumental in providing the mathematical foundations for Kepler's laws of planetary motion. He expanded the above rules by arguing that the orbits of comets like comets could be not only elliptical but also parabolic and hyperparabolic. He discovered the effects of light falling on a triangle called a prism. He explained in the method that when the light ray of Katiravan passes through a prism, it splits into seven colors. He also demonstrated that Newton's disc, which had many colors, turned white when rotated. Geshopan was the first to explain that white light is a combination of many colored lights. He closed one eye and looked at the sun with the other eye to research colors. Suddenly the colors started changing. But Newton suffered damage to that eye. Because of that he had to spend days in the dark removing spots that floated in front of his eyes. The emission theory of light was formulated by Newton. The theory is that what we see as light is particles emitted from a distant luminous object rushing through space at a speed of one hundred and nine hundred thousand miles per second. He is also noted for arguing that light is made of cloth. See: wave-cloth duality He postulated that the force of attraction between two cloths is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Discovery of the Law of Gravitation Newton was under an apple tree when an apple fell on his head, which sparked his thinking and led to the idea of ​​gravity in space. This is thought to be an exaggeration of his own story of observing an apple fall from a tree from the porch of Woolsthorpe Manor. Newton's story is also believed to have been made up by him at a later date. In 1667, he published his findings in De Analysi per Aequationes Numeri Terminorum Infinitas (De Analysi per Aequationes Numeri Terminorum Infinitas) and later De methodis serierum et fluxionum (Methods of Series and Fluxions). Newton and Leibniz developed separate mathematical theories and used different symbols. Although Newton had developed his methods before Leibniz, the latter's symbols and ""classification method"" were considered advanced and generally accepted. Although Newton was one of the most accomplished scientists of his time, his last 25 years were marred by problems with Leibniz. He accused Leibniz of stealing his discoveries. , persistence were the pillars and he continued his researches with confidence whenever his theories were fiercely opposed. In 1669, he was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. His position exempted him from the obligation to attend church to remain a fellow of the college, and avoided conflict with the orthodox church due to his anti-Christian views. Theories of Force All objects are attracted to each other; That gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. For every reaction, there is an equal reaction from the opposite direction. To move a stationary object, an external force is essential. Recognizing that Newton's books contained a wealth of knowledge, his friend Hayley encouraged Newton to publish them. As a result, the book ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" was published in 1687. Also known as ""Principia"", the book is considered to be the best scientific book ever published. For two years from 1692 to 1694, Newton was seriously ill. He had nervous problems and insomnia. Rumors spread that Newton had lost his mind. But later recovered well and engaged in university work. Texts Method of Fluxions (1671) Opticks (1704) Arithmetica Universalis (1707) Distinctions In 1703 Newton was elected President of the Royal Society. It is noteworthy that he was elected president every year for the next 25 years. In 1705, the Queen of England (Queen Anne) honored Newton with the title of 'Sir' when he visited the University of Cambridge. Isaac Newton says the following about his achievement despite his great achievement in the field of physics. Whatever I am to this world, I am a boy playing on the beach, I see the soft pebble and the beautiful conch, but the vast ocean is not before my eyes."" ""Sir Isaac Newton"", who is still considered to be the best scientist in England, fell ill and died of natural causes on March 20, 1727. He was buried in the famous ""Westminster Abbey"" in London. The best and priceless gem of mankind is inscribed on his tombstone. While many have paid tribute to Newton, Pope's is the most profound. This quote is still engraved in the room where Newton was born! ""Nature and its laws lay in darkness, God... Newton said let light be born.""

"Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and entrepreneur. He created many devices including light bulb, phonograph, screen camera. He was one of the first inventors to use the principles of mass production, unified large-scale teamwork. In 1880, Edison started a scientific magazine. It was a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1900. With a record 1,093 invention patents to his name, Edison is considered one of the most prolific inventors. Most of these were not invented by him; Modifications made to previous licenses. These too were mostly done by his large number of employees. Edison was often criticized for not giving others the credit for these inventions. However, Edison obtained licenses in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Edison founded the Motion Picture Patent Company, commonly known as the Edison Trust, a consortium of nine leading film studios. Young Pawan was born on 14th September 2004 in Ariyalur. Pawan's parents belonged to the middle class. Father Ravi is an Indian; Mother Sobana was a Khadur woman of lineage. She is a school teacher. Edison was the seventh and last born to them. Edison's family later moved to the Port of Oron, Michigan. Thomas Edison's hearing loss at an early age greatly influenced his later behavior and led to many innovations! In 1840, father Samuel Edison started a modest lumber business in Milan. Samuel then worked as a lighthouse keeper at Port Huron, Michigan and as a carpenter at the Fort Gradiate military base. Education Thomas Edison attended school in Port Huron at the age of eight and a half, delayed by an early bout with scarlet fever. Three months later, his schooling ended because the teacher scolded him for being 'mentally retarded'! So, his mother withdrew Tamasy from school and taught him lessons herself. Edison was educated at home for three years by his mother, a school teacher. Thomas's father Samuel encouraged him to study the Bible and fables along with reading, writing and arithmetic. By paying ten cents for completing each story. Soon Thomas learned many books. He was fond of reading and singing poetry. He was 11 years old when he learned to go to the library and pick up the reference book he needed. From the age of seven, Edison had a keen interest in mechanical devices. At the age of nine, he read Richard Parker's 'Natural & Experimental Philosophy'. At the age of thirteen, he studied the works of Thomas Paine and Isaac Newton's 'Theory'. At the age of 21, Orovari Vidadu read a section of Michael Baraday's newspaper entitled 'Practical Researches in Electricity'. This made a huge difference in his life! In practice, the experiments were fundamental to Edison's ability to understand and create. Edison, who had no formal knowledge of mathematics or science, created many rare technical instruments by experimenting and repeating himself. Work In the early 1860s, Edison got a job as a telegraph operator at a railroad station; Thomas is famous for operating high speed telegraph. His first inventions were telegraph-related equipment, such as the telegraph - and later work in the Union office with Wess. Edison continued his research between jobs. But on one occasion the sulfuric acid spilled out of a sulfuric-acid storage tank and flowed into the room where Pawan's boss was; His job was lost. After that he sold crackers and sweets at the railway station. Slaughtered pigs for some time; He did vegetable business. In 1862, he converted a box of a railway carriage into a printing press and published ""The Weekly Herald"" from it; He also applied for the first patent on October 28, 1868 (e-vote). Thomas moved to Newark, New Jersey to pursue his career as a full-time inventor. Edison set up his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Dudinada developed tools such as improved telegraphs to upload stock market points serially. But the instrument that made Edison famous was his phonograph in 1877. He was later given the title of ""Genius of Menlo Park"". Automatic telegraph recorder In 1859, Edison dropped out of school at the age of twelve and took a job as a newsboy at the Detroit-Port Huron Railroad. At the time, the Detroit Central Railroad was trying to track train traffic through a telegraphic recording system. Seizing the opportunity, he applied for the job and entered the telegraph apprenticeship in 1863. His deafness did not affect the work in any way, as telegraphic messages were recorded as dots and dashes! One had to read and understand the recorded dotted lines at that time and had to convert them into English and write them by hand. Edison spent six years doing the same work in the American South, Midwest, New England, and Canada. Then he showed his first creative talent by building a telegraph device that would facilitate this work. In 1869, at the age of 22, he demonstrated a 'double telegraph device' connected to a recording device, which transmitted two messages simultaneously over a single wire. He also set up to automatically convert the electrical signals of the telegraph into words. Edison quit his telegraph job and moved to New York City to pursue creative work full-time. There, in partnership with Frank Pope, he developed the Edison Universal Stock Printer and other printing equipment. In 1870-1875, New Jersey, New Ark, established the Automatic Telegraph system in the Western Union. The device, which ran on chemical energy, made transmission of electrical signals very difficult. To repair it, Edison had to improve his chemical knowledge. As a result of that research, devices such as the Electric Pen and the Mimeograph were developed. And it was because of that that Edison invented the phonograph. While Edison tended to invent new tools, many other rare tools appeared in between. One of them is a device called 'Carbon Transmitter'. The First Phonograph Invention In 1877, unexpectedly, among Edison's inventions, a technological pioneer was the phonograph (gramophone). Frenchman Leon Scott wrote in a book the theory that 'if every sound could be recorded on a plate, they would be in a unique form like shorthand'. That is called phonography. To prove the theory, Edison attached a needle to his transmitter and recorded sound waves on parchment paper. To his astonishment, the sound traces were drawn on the paper in an invisible, crumpled and delicate manner. Then rubbing the needle over the sound track and listening to it through the loudspeaker, the recorded sound came back to the ear! Edison next recorded the sound track around a tin foil on a cylinder. In December 1877, Edison named it the Tinfoil Phonograph. But it took decades for his phonograph to go from the lab to the commercial field. Gas lamps were used on street poles during Edison's invention of the electric bulb and energy storage device. For fifty years the 'electric lamp' has been a dream for many and a failure for trying creative engineers! It was then that scientists were doing many studies on 'amplitude lamp'. During the solar eclipse of July 29, 1878, several American scientists went to do some research in the Rocky Mountains. They needed an instrument to measure the heat difference produced by the 'solar flare' during an eclipse. Edison used a carbon button device to make a device called the 'microscope'. The current flowing in the wire can be controlled by the instrument. Edison became interested in making an electric lamp using this method. J.P., who started the 'Edison Electric Light Company' for researches on Edison's electric lamp. The Morgan team provided an upfront payment of $30,000. In December 1878, a 26-year-old Princeton University science graduate Francis Upton joined Edison's research team. All the mathematical and physical science subtleties that Edison did not know were available to Edison through young Francis. Edison was the first to use a metal wire with high resistance for the light bulb. Due to the high current flowing in the electric circuit, if one of the power lamps failed, all the lamps went out. Edison connected electric lamps in a parallel circuit, reducing the current level so that a repair in one lamp did not affect the other lamps. Edison's team created the first light bulb by using platinum wire coiled in a vacuum bulb and lighting it with a controlled current. In January 1881, the first commercialization of the 'electric light system' took place at the New York printing house of Hind & Ketchum. Located in lower Manhattan, New York, the world's first commercial 'central electric utility' was established under Edison's direct watch. It started functioning from September 1882. Later, the electric light system was developed, and the fame of the creative genius Edison spread around the world to light bulbs everywhere, such as large restaurants, arenas, commercial areas, and shops. The Electric Motor Meanwhile, in 1879, Edison and Upton completed enough research to build the first electric storage battery. When driven by mechanical energy, voltage is generated in the electric storage cell, and electric power is available at the end of the wire. Edison demonstrated that if a voltage is applied to the negative terminals of an electric storage cell, the same device can produce mechanical power in an electric motor. This is also his first achievement. When the Edison effect lamp was lit, the positive pole of the vacuum bulb coil was surrounded by a kind of blue glow. When Edison recorded the light bulb in 1883, he named the phenomenon the 'Edison Effect'. Fifteen years later in 1898 J. J. Thomson discovered the first 'anti-electron' [electron]. Only then did scientists explain the Edison effect. That is, when the electrons travel from the hot end to the cold end by thermal emission [Thermionic Emission], such a blue glow arises at the anode! That later paved the way for the emergence of the 'Electron Tube' and laid the foundation for the 'Electronic Industry'. New York City and Electric Lights It was Edison's desire to have electric lights shine in the houses and streets of New York City where he lived at the time. But no one, including other scientists, believed that his wish would come true in the days when only gas and oil lamps were used. The scientists made three arguments against Edison. 1. Power cannot be distributed to multiple locations. 2. It's impossible to predict how much everyone will use it even if it ends up being the same. 3. Electric light is not as cheap as gas light. There was truth in what they said because science had developed at that time. Edison's ideology was that if the means did not exist they had to be created. He read every book and article that would help him in his research. In two hundred notes, over 40,000 pages, he researched and recorded his ideas and diagrams. Finally his dream came true. New York City was the first city in the world to be lit by electric lights. He had begun other research in his laboratory when journalists and scientists flocked to praise him. When asked by journalists about his great research success, he said with a smile: ""I don't want to waste today's time talking about yesterday's discovery."" Edison's famous motto ""one percent knowledge, 99 percent labor"" is the cause of success Film Shooting Equipment Having succeeded in researching the gramophone phonograph, Edison next attempted to develop film shooting equipment in the 1880s. Edison used his research efforts and the work of his subordinates to develop a moving film camera. This thought had been with Edison for ten years. Edison once said about it: 'It dawned on me in my imagination. A 'moving picture' can treat the human eye just as the phonograph treats music to the ear. I can make a 'talking film' by combining phonograph sound technology with film shooting equipment. Helping to develop the first moving picture, Edison's assistant, W.K.L. Dixon. In 1888, Edison created the first film shooting device, the Kinetoscope. But the whole picture looked a bit blurry in it. In 1889, Freese-Greene, who lived in Britain, used a type of recording tape to print portraits. The same tape was used by George Eastman in America a few years ago and he took pictures on that tape. For the first time, Edison expanded the kinetoscope, a fifty-foot-long film reel that was driven by an electric motor and projected talking images through a magnifying glass onto a silver screen. Edison registered the film shooting device in the United States in 1891. Edison died at the age of 84 on October 18, 1931 in West Orange, New Jersey. American President Herbert Hoover had ordered the lights to be turned off for one minute throughout the United States during Edison's funeral. He was cremated on October 21 at 9:59 PM. On the evening of October 21 in New York, the torch in the hand of the 'Statue of Liberty' lost its light! All the lights except the Broadway lights and the traffic lights on the street went out. Lights were switched off in important places like Chicago and Denver. Usatuna external links , c.

"Aaru (pronounced) (nadi in vernacular) is a large stream of naturally flowing fresh water. Rivers usually originate in mountainous regions. The land on either side of the river is called the bank. Rivers usually join another river, lakes or ocean. Current in a river is due to gravity. Sometimes rivers are absorbed into the ground or dried up before reaching another water table. Larger streams are called rivers and smaller ones are called streams. However, there is no general rule as to what can be called a river. A river is a component of the water cycle. The water in the river is usually obtained from rainfall. Rainwater reaches the river by surface runoff, recharge of groundwater, and recharge of natural aquifers. Rivers may originate from springs, lakes, melting glaciers, runoff from rainwater, or in a number of other ways. Usually rivers are joined by other rivers. Such rivers are called tributaries or tributaries. Amount of water carried in a river. A river is a combination of surface water and invisible underground water. In rivers flowing through large valleys this component of invisible current may be much greater than the volume of visible water above. Rivers that flow from their source to their basin usually flow into oceans or bodies of water such as large lakes. Evaporation of river water in arid areas can lead to such water levels and premature drying. Some rivers are absorbed into the ground through soil or permeable rocks. It remains as ground water. Heavy abstraction of water for industrial and irrigation purposes can also see the river dry up before reaching its natural termination point. The area that supplies water to a river or the land drained by a river is called a watershed or catchment area. Land Structure Water flowing into a river generally flows through its channel. It is made up of a river bed between two banks. Large rivers have flood plains outside this drainage area. It is formed when river water flows out of the drainage area during floods. Flood plains can be as large as river channels. Mostly rivers flow in one way. But some rivers are connected by many channels and form braided rivers. Such large rivers are found only in some parts of the world, such as the South Island of New Zealand. Braided rivers are located in erosion plains and some river estuaries. A flowing river is a source of energy. As a result, this current affects the channel of the river and changes its shape. According to Brahm's law, the mass of an object carried by a river is proportional to the sixth power of the velocity of the river. Thus, when the velocity of the river is doubled, it has the power to carry 64 times more material. In hilly hard rock zones, due to this, erosion channels are formed through hard rocks, and large rocks break down to form sand and small stones. In the intervening parts of a river's course, when it flows on plains, bank erosion causes meanders, and sedimentation takes place in such inner meanders. Where the river courses form a loop, sometimes the river runs across and merges to form a loop-shaped lake, shortening the length of the river course. Classification Although the classification shown below helps visualize rivers, there are many other factors to consider. The slope of the stream depends on the surface movements, but the flow rate depends on the climate, the amount of sediment, the topography and the slope. The river of youth It is a fast-flowing river with steep slope, few tributaries. Such rivers are also deeply eroding in width. (Eg: Brazos River, Trinity River, Ebro River) A mature river Younger rivers also have lower gradients and are slower flowing. Its tributaries are widely eroded. These have more tributaries and have higher water supply than younger rivers. (eg: Mississippi River, St. Lawrence River, Danube River, Ohio River, Thames River) old river It has less slump and less corrosion potential. Their special feature is having flood plains. (Eg: Huang He River, Ganges River, Tigris River, Euphrates River, Indus River, Nile River) Putilamai River An additional river due to subsidence by tectonic movements. Importance of Rivers The great civilizations of the world are located on the banks of rivers. Rivers fulfill not only the drinking water needs of humans but also their living needs. Agriculture, many types of industries (eg: paper mills) depend on river water. Nowadays electricity is also generated using current.

"The Amazon River (Sri Lankan case: Amazon River, commonly abbreviated Amazon (US: /ˈæməzɒn/ or UK: /ˈæməzən/; Spanish and Portuguese: Amazonas)) is a river in the South American continent. It is one of the two longest rivers in the world, the other being the Nile River. .The Amazon is the largest river in the world, and according to some authors, it is the largest river in the world with a length of 6400 km .Its total volume is greater than the volume of fresh water of the next eight major rivers. The course of this river has changed many times. Originally flowing towards the west, this river flows towards the east due to the growth of the Andes Mountains. The Amazon River is not crossed by a bridge anywhere. This is not because of its width, but because modern engineers can build a bridge across it. However, as most of the river flows through tropical rainforests and there are few cities there is no need for a bridge. Although the Amazon River is the largest in the world by various measures, it is only slightly shorter than the Nile in terms of length, according to most geographers. However, some scientists from Brazil and Peru refuse to accept this. The river discharges approximately 209,000 cubic meters per second—approximately 6,591 cubic kilometers per year, more than the next seven largest rivers combined—and the Amazon accounts for 20% of the world's river discharge.[1] The Amazon basin is the world's largest drainage basin, covering an area of ​​approximately 7,050,000 square kilometers (2,720,000 sq mi). Countries where the Amazon flows Although its tributaries originate in Peru and Ecuador, most of its riverbed is located in Brazil. Amazon has more than six thousand affiliates. Out of these 17 rivers have a length of more than 1000 km. Watershed The Amazon drainage basin is the largest in the world. It accounts for approximately 40 percent of the area of ​​South America. A catchment area of ​​this is found in the inner Andean highlands. The area is close to the Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River drains a lot of water into the Atlantic Ocean. During the rainy season the flow was up to 300,000 cubic meters per second and during the period 1973-1990 it was approximately 209,000 cubic meters. The Amazon basin is connected to the basin of the Orinoco, another major river in South America, by the Caziquier Canal. So it is called a natural water connection. Although the term canal refers to the Casiquiuer, it is a tributary of the upper Orino River. It runs south to join the Rio Negro, a tributary of the Amazon. ORIGIN The Amazon River is a large multi-tributary river system in Peru and Ecuador. Many flow directly into rivers such as the Maranon and Ugayali. Several rivers like the Marana, Pastaza, Nuguere, etc. flow into the main Amazon River. It was established in 2001-2007 that the Amazon is formed in the glacial lake of the snow-capped Navato Misimi peak in the Andean mountain range of Peru. It is west of Lake Titicaca and southeast of Lima. Water from the Navado Misimi flows into the Cupiradas Carcusanta and Apaceda Rivers, which join the Rio Apurimac, a tributary of the Ugayali River. The Ugayali joins the Marañon to form the main Amazon River. This location is considered by most geologists to be the origin of the primary Amazon. The river here is called Solimos dos Aguas in Brazil. After a thousand miles the dark colored Rio Negro joins the muddy Amazon. For six miles the two run in unbroken succession. Floods Not all Amazon tributaries flood at the same time. Most of them start flooding in November and last till June. The Rio Negro begins to flood in February or March and recedes by June. The Medirera floods and recedes two months before other Amazon tributaries. The average depth of the river during monsoon is 40 feet. The main river is approximately one to six miles wide. Larger ocean-going cells can reach as far as Manaus. Smaller 3000 ton or 9000 ton cells with the lower part of the cell up to 18 feet above the water level can travel up to 3600 km in the river. Estuary There is a difference of opinion among experts regarding the width of its estuary due to the geography of the estuary. The Para River is counted along with the Amazon. Sometimes the Para River is considered a separate tributary of the Tocantins River. The estuary of the Para River is larger. The Para and Amazon rivers are connected by various canals. Between these lies Marajó Island. Its area is as big as Switzerland. Wildlife One-third of the world's species live in the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon basin and rainforest cover more than 5.4 million square km (2.1 million sq mi). More than 3,000 species of fish have been found in the Amazon River. The Amazon River Dolphin lives in the Amazon and Orinoco River basins. It is the largest of the river dolphin species. It can grow up to 100 feet. Birnka is the most common type of fish found here. They live in groups. These can attack animals like cows and deer. Humans have also been attacked. However, some species of pirangas attack humans. The red-bellied branca is particularly virulent in humans. Anaconda snakes are found along the shores of the Amazon basin. It is one of the largest snake species. They mostly live in water. Only its nose is above the water level. Amazon rainforest Main article: Amazon rainforest The Amazon rainforest begins east of the Andes mountain range. It is the world's largest rainforest and ecologically important. It is capable of consuming a large amount of carbon-dioxide emitted in the world. Protecting these rainforests is a major issue these days. The very humid Amazon Basin is a bastion of these rainforests. In this region, the Amazon River and its hundreds of tributaries flow very slowly and then flow into the ocean. This biologically rich rainforest is home to 25 lakh species of insects, thousands of plant species and approximately two thousand birds and mammals. A fifth of the world's bird species live in these forests. The Amazon rainforest is located mostly in Brazil, making it the second largest forested area (4,776,980 sq km) after Russia.

"Canals are divided into canals for irrigation and canals for shipping. Canals are man-made straits for transportation. Cuts connecting two seas, rivers, or lakes are cut with the aim of shortening the navigation distance. Suez Canal and Panama Canal are notable canals cut for shipping. HISTORY Cattle-driven cart transport capacity was within a certain limit. A mule can carry goods weighing up to 250 pounds (113kg) for days or weeks in a locked cart of up to 8 tons [1].[1] It is suitable for very small spaces and periods and requires roads for carriages. Instead, the canal was suitable for simple, cheap transportation in ancient times. The earliest known canals in ancient history were irrigation canals, which were built in ancient Mesopotamia around BC. Built 4000 years ago, now in the countries of Iraq and Syria. The Indus Valley Civilization, in ancient India, developed modern irrigation and storage systems, including reservoirs built at Kirnar.[2] Canals in Egypt At least during the reign of Pepy I Mary] (reign 2332–2283 BC) a canal was built across the Nile near Aswan.[3] In ancient Chinese history, major canals for river transport were developed in the period 481-221 BC. According to the ancient historian Siva Gyan, the longest canal was built at Hanga Kha. The canal intersects the regions of Chang, Zhang, Chen, Cai, Gao and Wei.[4] The longest canal in the world today, and one of the tallest canals, is the Grand Canal of China. Still in use today.[5] Greek engineers were the first to use aqueducts as early as the 3rd century BC to regulate the flow of water in the ancient Suez Canal.[6][7][8] Significance Historically canals have been of great importance to trade and development, and the growth of a civilization. By 1855 the Lehigh Canal was mining 1.2 million tons of clean-burning analamic coal; The canal, which was in operation for about a century, was discontinued in the 1930s by its developer. Some of the canals still in operation in our modern times have been a necessary driving force for the economy, and indeed urbanization and industrialization have necessitated canals. Transportation of bulk raw materials such as coal and ores is difficult without water transportation and relatively less expensive compared to other types of transportation. During the 17th and 20th centuries a cycle of increased mechanization resulted in industrial developments and new metals fueling such raw materials. As new fields of research led to new industries and economic progress, the need for canals was critical to any industrialized society to raise the standard of living. Surviving canals, including most ship canals, today primarily serve the freight and large shipping industries, while canals that once served inland waterways have since become abandoned, neglected, and drained. Whereas dams were used to control and store flood water and for pleasure boat traffic. Canal shipping first boomed in the United States in the mid-1850s, but canal traffic soon declined and was largely abandoned with the advent of cheaper rail transportation. By the early 1880s, canals were off the map as economically competitive with railroads. Over the next two decades, coal exports declined sharply with the introduction of oil-fired thermal generation, and the demand for coal declined. Later, after World War I, with the advent of the motor vehicle, freight traffic with small American embankments and multiple trains saw a steady decline in ten-mile stretches, flexibility and the ability to carry freight on steep inclines increased along road traffic, and road replaced freight rail that could not operate in the winter. Traffic increased. Construction of canals can be done in one or a combination of the following three ways, depending on available water and route available: Man-made Streams Canals can be created artificially even where natural streams do not exist. What if? Canals can be created by artificially deepening and strengthening their banks with stone and cement concrete mixtures. Water for the canal should be supplied from an external source such as streams or reservoirs. In the new waterways, barrages were built to raise and lower ships in the canals by sophisticated engineering works such as hoists or elevators. E.g. Canals that connect valleys on higher ground, such as the Canal du Midi, Canal de Prairie, and the Panama Canal. A canal can be constructed by scouring and deepening the existing lake bed sand. After the canal dredging is completed, the water in the lake is reduced and the canal is filled with water to serve as drainage for drainage of the surrounding area and for waterway transport. E.g. Lage Ward (nl). Build two parallel embankments in a lake, lay a new canal between the embankments, and then drain the rest of the lake water so that only the excess water is in the canal and the rest of the lake is drained. The North Sea Canal in the eastern and central parts was constructed in this manner. Canal and waterway construction A natural stream can be converted into a canal to create a controlled waterway that can be easily predicted. How is this possible? The flow of water is regulated by deepening and diverting and diverting the course of the stream. This allows cargo to be transported very easily by small boats and large ships. E.g. The coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania includes the Lehigh Canal on the Passo Savon, the Canal de Mines de Fer las Moselle, and the Eisen River. Lateral canals When the natural stream cannot be converted into a channel, an artificial channel parallel to the side is constructed to give way to the second stream. This is called the lateral canal. Natural streams sometimes have continuous curves, horseshoe-shaped curves and when they are unrepairable, lateral canals can be easily constructed to have a smooth flow path, and the natural stream will act as a source of water for the canal. E.g. These include the Sasapeake and Ohio Canal, the Lateral La Loire Canal, the Carron Latnal Canal, and the Juliana Canal. Irrigation canals are of three types namely river irrigation canals, supply canals, diversion canals, irrigation canals or canals.[9] Supply Channel (Supply Channel) Heads of supply channels are cut only at certain bends in rivers. When cut like that, only water from the river goes into the canal. Sand will be prevented from entering. And even during periods of low flow in the river, water flows into the canal unhindered. An example of this is the canal that carries water from the Vaigai River to North Lake. Surplus Channel or Surplus Channel Surplus Channel is a channel that discharges the surplus water of the lakes through Kalingal during floods. Their capacity is equal to the capacity of the lake drainage channel. Water inflow and outflow will be balanced to prevent flooding. Irrigation channel or distribution channel Water is distributed to the irrigated lands through these canals set up on the outside of the lake bed. These canals were built according to the size of the lands and were called Kannar, Vati and Pilaru. Floating Cities Canals are so closely associated with the city of Venice that many (canal) floating cities are named ""Venice of ..."" The city is built on marshy islands, with wooden frames used to support the buildings, and the city is man-made. The islands have a long history; By the 12th century, Venice was a powerful city. Amsterdam was built like Venice. It became a city in the 1300s. Many canals were built as a strong part of Amsterdam. The city expanded and houses were built along the canals. Other cities with extensive canal infrastructure include: Almamarr, Amerspoort, Bulwart, Breil, Delft, Den Bosch, Togum, Dordrecht, Nkuijn, Franker, Gouda, Haarlem, Harlingen, Leeuwarden, Leiden, Sneek, and Utrecht in the Netherlands; Praji and Gent's Blonders, Belgium; Birmingham in England; Saint Petersburg in Russia; Aveiro in Portugal; Hamburg and Berlin in Germany; Fort Lauderdale and Cape Coral, Florida, USA and Lahore, Pakistan. The Liverpool Seaport is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the heart of Liverpool, England, where infiltrating waterways and reservoirs have been developed, mainly for residential and recreational use.

"Olympic Games (Olympic Games or Olympics) is an international competition for various sports held every two years in summer and winter alternately. Thousands of athletes participate in it. Over 200 countries participate in the Olympics, considered the premier sporting event in the world.[1] The practice of holding these competitions dates back to ancient Greece. Later, in the late 19th century, the practice of holding these competitions was revived by a French nobleman named Pierre Freddie, Duke of Coubertin. He created the International Olympic Committee in 1894. Its organization and powers are defined by the Olympic Charter. The International Olympic Committee manages the Olympic movement. The Summer Olympic Games have been held every four years since 1896, excluding World War II years. The earliest Olympic Games were held in Olympia, Greece in 776 BC until 393 AD. Greek poet Panagiotis Soutzas' poem ""Dialogue of the Dead"" written in 1833 AD created interest in resuming the contests. The development of the Olympic Movement in the 20th and 21st centuries brought many changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these changes include the introduction of the Winter Olympic Games, Paralympic Games for the disabled, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenagers. The Winter Olympic Games have been held since 1924 to host the Winter Games. Initially, the Summer and Winter Olympic Games were held in the same year. Since 1994, the Winter Olympics have been held two years after the Summer Olympics. The Olympic Committee also had to make various changes in accordance with the developments in the fields of economy, politics and technology. Coubertin, the creator of this phenomenon, intended for it to be a competition involving non-professional competitors. However, the Olympic Committee changed this rule and allowed professional athletes to participate in the Games. As the importance of mass media grew, corporate advertising sponsorships developed and the contests became commercialized. The 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics were canceled due to World War II. The 1980 and 1984 games were held with limited participation as many countries boycotted the competition during the Cold War. The Olympic Movement consists of the International Games Federation, the National Olympic Committees, and the Organizing Committees for each Olympic Games. As a decision-making body, the International Olympic Committee decides which cities will host the Games. The city thus selected shall be responsible for organizing and financing the Games in accordance with the Olympic Charter. The International Olympic Committee is also responsible for deciding the program of sports to be included in the Games. Symbols like the Olympic flag, the torch, and events like the opening and closing ceremonies are part of the Olympic Games. Over 13,000 athletes participate in approximately 400 events across 33 different sports at the Summer and Winter Olympics. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded to the first, second and third place finishers in each competition. The Olympic Games have grown to include almost every country in the world. Such growth has also led to many challenges related to neglect, drug use, handouts, terrorist activities etc. Biennial competitions and the associated media publicity give many athletes the opportunity to gain national and sometimes even international fame. The Olympics also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world. Ancient Olympic Games The Ancient Olympic Games were held every four years at the Temple of Zeus in Olympia, Greece as a religious and sporting event. It was a competition between athletes from the city-states and kingdoms of Greece at that time. Although mostly athletic games were held, combat-based competitions such as jousting, horse racing, and chariot racing were also held. Many have written that during these games, all conflicts between city governments were postponed until after the games. This became known as the Olympic Peace or the Olympic Truce. But this is an untrue notion that has arisen in modern times. The Greeks never postponed wars among themselves. Although the exact origin of the Olympics is not known, there are many stories about it. Heracles, the son of the god Zeus, built the Olympic Games to honor his father. When this was finished, he walked two hundred paces in a straight line and pronounced the distance as an isutadian. This was later taken as a measure of distance. It is widely accepted that the Olympic Games originated in 776 BC. The Olympic Games of that time included running events, jumping events, discus throwing, javelin throwing, tug-of-war, and horse racing.[2][3] According to legend, the first conqueror was a cook named Koroebusu from the city of Elisha.[4] The Olympics of that time had a religious significance. In addition to sporting events, ceremonial processions were held in honor of the god Zeus and Phelps, the god-hero and mythological king of Olympia. Poems were composed about winners of sporting events and statues were erected to honor them.[5] The Olympic Games were at their peak in the sixth and fifth centuries BC. As the Romans grew in power and their influence in Greece grew, the importance of the Olympics gradually began to decline. Although there is no consensus among scholars as to when these games ceased, the majority agree that they ceased in AD 393, the year when Theodosius I banned all idolatry and related rituals. His successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.

"Microbiology (Sri Lankan case: முக்குக்கு; English: Microbiology) is the study of everything related to microbes. These include protozoan/protozoan bacteria to protozoa such as fungi, algae, and protozoa. It also includes courses on malpractices. These are called microorganisms (from the Greek μῑκρος mīkros meaning ""micro"", βίος bios meaning ""life"", and -λογία -logia) Microbes are single-celled or multi-cellular microscopic organisms.[1] These include eukaryotes and prokaryotes such as fungi and protozoa (protists). Viruses, although not clearly classified as living organisms, are also studied.[2] Briefly Microbiology refers to the study of life and organisms that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Microbiology is generally the study of the immune system, or the study of immunology. Normally immune systems deal with pathogenic microbes; These two courses overlap with each other, which is why many colleges offer a combined degree program like ""Microbiology and Immunology"". Microbiology is a broad term that encompasses virology, mycology, parasitology, bacteriology and other disciplines. A microbiologist specializes in microbiology. Microbiology is actively studied. And this sector is constantly progressing. It is safe to say that we have probably learned only about one percent of all microbes on Earth.[3] Although microbes have been studied directly for more than three hundred years, the field of microbiology is still in its infancy compared to older biological disciplines such as zoology and botany. History Archeology The existence of microbes was hypothesized for centuries before they were actually discovered in the 17th century. Around 600 BC, the ancient Indian surgeon Susruta explained in the Susruta Samita that microbes are the cause of various diseases and can be spread by touch, air or water. Ideological views on microbes were found in the book On Agriculture by the Roman scholar Marcus Terence Varro. In it he cautions against building a dwelling near water-logged places. This indicated that there was an ancient awareness of diseases that could be transmitted by invisible organisms. Avicenna (Abū Alī ibn Sīnā) stated in The Canon of Medicine that bodily secretions are contaminated with foreign matter present in the earth prior to infection.[4] He also hypothesized about the contagious nature of asthma and other infectious diseases. He used isolation as a way to reduce the spread of infections.[5] In the 14th century, when the Black Death bubonic plague reached al-Andalus, Ibn Khatima hypothesized that infectious diseases were caused by ""subtle substances"" entering the human body and causing disease.[4] Infectious diseases are caused by transmissible seed-like material. In 1546, Crocolo Fragastoro stated that these substances could transmit disease through direct or indirect contact, or even over long distances without direct contact. All these early claims about the existence of microbes were based on speculation. Not based on any data or science. Microorganisms were not demonstrated or studied until the 17th century. or is not properly and accurately described. The reason for this is that in all these studies, the microscope was the most basic tool necessary for the survival of microbiology and bacteriology as a science. Modern History Bacteria, and other microorganisms, were first studied by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 with a single-lens microscope he designed himself. Leeuwenhoek, who made one of the most important discoveries in biology through this work, also pioneered scientific fields such as bacteriology and microbiology.[1] The name ""bacterium"" was coined much later by Ehrenberg in 1828. He derived it from the Greek word κατέριον, meaning ""small stick"". Although van Leeuwenhoek is often credited as the first microbiologist, the first recorded microbiological study of fungi on fruit products was carried out long before that by Robert Hooke in 1665.[6] The field of bacteriology (which later became a subfield of microbiology) is generally considered to have been founded by Ferdinand Cohn (1828–1898). A botanist, his research on algae and photosynthetic bacteria led to his ability to describe many bacteria, including Bacillus and Pechiatoa. Cohn was also the first to establish a scheme for taxonomic classification of bacteria.[7] Louis Basser (1822-1895) and Robert Koch (1843-1910) were also contemporaries of Kohn. They are often cited as the founders of clinical microbiology.[8] Bascher became famous for designing a series of experiments aimed at disproving the then-widespread theory of spontaneous generation and thereby establishing the identity of microbiology as a biological science.[9] Pasteur discovered methods of preserving food (pasteurization) and cures for various diseases such as anthrax, fowl cholera, and rabies.[1] Koch is best known for his contributions to the germ theory of disease. He demonstrated that specific diseases are caused by specific pathogenic microbes. Koch developed a number of qualifications. These are called Koch's subplanes. Koch was one of the first scientists to isolate and grow only bacteria in microculture. Because of this, he was able to describe several important bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is responsible for asthma.[1] Although Bascher and Koch are often considered the founders of microbiology, their work does not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world. This is because their exclusive focus was on microbes with direct clinical relevance. It was only after the work of Martinus Beijering (1851 – 1931) and Sergei Vinogradsky (1856 – 1953), the founders of general microbiology (an older term that encompassed all of the physiology, diversity, and ecology of microorganisms), that the true breadth of microbiology became apparent.[1] Beijing made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of intensive microbial culture techniques.[10] His work on Tobago mosaic virus established basic principles of virology. His intensive microbial culture development technology allowed the artificial cultivation of a wide variety of microbes with widely varying physiologies and had an immediate impact on the field of microbiology. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotherapy. He thereby discovered the essential role of microbes in geochemical processes.[11] He was the first scientist to isolate and describe both nitrogen-fixing and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.[1] Departments The Department of Microbiology can generally be divided into various sub-disciplines: Microbial Physiology: It is the science that studies how the microbial cell functions biochemically. This includes studying microbial growth, microbial metabolism and microbial cell structure. Microbial Genomics: It is the study of how genes are regulated and regulated in microorganisms according to their cellular functions. It is the most closely related field to molecular biology. Cell Microbiology: This is a field that bridges microbiology and cell biology. Medical Microbiology: It is the study of pathogenic microbes and the role of microbes in human diseases. It would have suppressed the education of microbial pathogenesis and epidemiology. Related to epidemiology and immunology education. Veterinary Microbiology: Education on the role of microbes in veterinary medicine or animal taxonomy. Environmental Microbiology: It is the study of microorganisms in their natural environment and their functions and diversity. Evolutionary Microbiology: Education on the Evolution of Microbes. Education on bacterial systematics and taxonomy was suppressed. Industrial Microbiology: The application of microorganisms to industrial processes. Examples include industrial fermentation and wastewater treatment. It is a field closely related to the field of biotechnology. This field also includes fermentation, an important application of microbiology. Biomicrobiology: The study of microbes in the air. Food Microbiology: The study of microorganisms responsible for food spoilage and foodborne illness. This includes the use of microbes in food preparation (for example through the fermentation process). Pharmaceutical Microbiology: It is the study of microorganisms responsible for pharmaceutical spoilage and deterioration. (Many positions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require a degree in microbiology). Benefits Some people fear all microbes because some microbes are associated with various human diseases. However, many microorganisms are also responsible for numerous beneficial processes such as industrial fermentation techniques (e.g. alcohol, vinegar, and dairy products), anti-biotic production, and serving as pilot vehicles for experimental cloning in higher organisms such as plants. Bacteria can be used to produce amino acids in industry. Corynebacterium glutamicum is one of the most important bacterial organisms required to produce more than two million tons of amino acids per year, mainly L-glutamate and L-lysine.[12] Different types of biopolymers such as polysaccharides, polyesters, and polyamides are also produced by microorganisms. Microorganisms are used to biotechnologically produce biopolymers with optimal properties suitable for high-value medical applications such as tissue engineering and drug delivery.[13] Microorganisms aid in the process of biodegradation and bioremediation of domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes and subsurface contaminants in soil, sediment and marine environments. The ability of a microorganism to kill toxic waste depends on the nature of each contaminant. Since many contaminant types are commonly present at contaminated sites, the most effective approach to microbial degradation is to use a mixture of different bacterial types and species that degrade one or more types of contaminants.[14] Various claims also suggest that microbes contribute to human and animal health through the consumption of probiotics (active bacteria beneficial to the digestive system) and/or prebiotics (foods ingested to promote the growth of probiotic microbes).[15] Recent studies have indicated that microbes can also be beneficial in cancer treatment. Various species of non-pathogenic Clostrida can also invade solid tumors and multiply. Clostridial vectors can be administered safely and are capable of delivering therapeutic proteins in various clinical models.[16] Notes Additional reading CS1 maint: extra text: authors list (link) See also Bacteria Biotechnology Biochemistry Biosecurity Biotechnology Environmental Microbiology Eukaryote | Food Microbiology Genetics Immunology Important publications in the field of microbiology Industrial Microbiology | Medical Technologist Medicine Oral microbiology Prokaryote Virology External links General University of South Carolina Journals Descriptions and summaries of a wide range of journals in all areas of microbiology Professional organizations Category:Microbiology ",Who is the father of viruses?,Martinus Beijering,6954
". In physics, energy (energy, in Greek ἐνέργεια – energeia, ""action, ἐνεργός – energos, ""actively acting"") [1]) is simply defined as the quantity capable of doing work. That is, the energy of a substance is considered to indicate the amount of work it can do. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but one type of energy can be converted into another. The unit of energy in the International System of Units is the joule. The work done to move an object a distance of 1 meter is the joule. Kinetic energy of an object in motion, gravitational force, potential energy stored in an object in the form of electric or magnetic forces, elastic energy stored in the stretching of solids, chemical energy released when fuel burns, radiant energy stored in light, and thermal energy due to the temperature of an object are all common forms of energy. Mass and energy are closely related. Because of the mass–energy equation, which shows how the mass of an object is related to its energy, any object at rest has a constant energy equal to its constant mass. Additionally, if some form of energy is added to the object, the total mass of the object will increase as much as the energy. For example, after heating a substance, we can measure and sense the increase in mass as well as the increase in energy. The sensitivity of this increase is adequate. Just as humans survive on the energy they get from food, other organisms also need energy to survive. The energy that humans need comes from energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy. Earth's climate and environmental processes are powered by radiant energy from the Sun and the Earth's geothermal energy. What is energy? The ability to do work is called energy. ஆற்றலின் வடிவங்கள் ஒரு முறைமையின் மொத்த ஆற்றல் பல்வேறு வழிகளில் பிரிக்கப்பட்டு வகைப்படுத்தப்படுறது. எடுத்துக்காட்டாக விசையியலிருந்து மரபார்ந்த விசையியல் வேறுபடுத்தப்படுகிறது. விண்வெளியின் ஊடாக நகரும் பொருள் மற்றும் அதன் நிலையாற்றல் ஆகியனவற்றைக் கொண்டு ஒரு பொருளின் இயக்க ஆற்றல் தீர்மானிக்கப்படுகிறது. விண்வெளிக்குள் அப்பொருளின் இருப்பிடம் இங்கு முக்கியத்துவம் பெறுகிறது. புவியீர்ப்பு சக்தி, வெப்ப ஆற்றல், பல வகையான அணுக்கரு ஆற்றல், மின் ஆற்றல் மற்றும் காந்த ஆற்றல் போன்ற ஆற்றல்களுக்கிடையிலான வேறுபாடுகளை விளக்கவும் இத்துறை மிகுந்த பயனளிக்கிறது. இந்த வகைப்பாடுகளில் ஒன்றுடன் ஒன்று; உதாரணமாக, வெப்ப ஆற்றல் வழக்கமாக இயக்கவியல் மற்றும் பகுதியளவு சக்திவாய்ந்த பகுதியை கொண்டுள்ளது. இந்த வகைப்பாடுகளில் பல ஒன்றுடன் ஒன்று கலந்திருப்பதாகக் தோன்றுகின்றன. உதாரணமாக, வெப்ப ஆற்றல் வழக்கமாக பகுதியளவு இயக்கவியலும் பகுதியளவு நிலையாற்றலையும் கொண்டுள்ளது. சில வகையான ஆற்றல்கள் நிலையாற்றல் மற்றும் இயக்க ஆற்றல் ஆகிய இரண்டின் மாறுபட்ட கலவையாகும். இயந்திர ஆற்றலை இதற்கு ஒர் உதாரணமாகக் கூறலாம். இது நிலையாற்றல் மற்றும் இயக்க ஆற்றல் ஆகியவற்றின் கலவையாகும். இந்த பட்டியல் நிறைவுபெற வேண்டியதற்கான அவசியம் இல்லை. எப்போதெல்லாம் விஞ்ஞானிகள் ஆற்றல் பாதுகாப்பு விதியை மீறுவதாக கண்டறிகிறார்களோ அப்போதெல்லாம் புதிய ஆற்றல் வடிவங்கள் சேர்க்கப்பட்டு முரண்பாட்டினை வெளிப்படுத்துகின்றன. வெப்பம் மற்றும் வேலை என்பவை சிறப்பு வகை ஆற்றல்களாகும், அவை ஆற்றலின் பண்புகள் அல்ல, மாறாக ஆற்றல் மாற்றச் செயல்முறைகளின் பண்புகளாகக் கருதப்படுகின்றன. ஒரு பொருளில் எவ்வளவு வெப்பம் அல்லது வேலை உள்ளது என்பதை பொதுவாக அளவிட முடியாது, ஆனால் ஒரு குறிப்பிட்ட செயல்முறை நிகழ்வின் போது அப்பொருட்களில் ஏற்படும் ஆற்றல் மாற்றத்தை அளவிட முடியும். நாம் நோக்கும் திசையிலிருந்து வெப்பம் அல்லது வேலையின் அளவு நேர்மறை அல்லது எதிர்மறை அளவுகளாக அளவிடலாம். நிலையாற்றல்கள் பொதுவாக நேர்மறை அல்லது எதிர்மறை அளவுகளாக கணக்கிடப்படுகின்றன. ஒரு குறிப்பிட்ட அடிப்படை நிலையில் உள்ள ஆற்றலைக் காட்டிலும் குறைவாகவோ அல்லது கூடுதலாகவோ உள்ள அளவை அடிப்படையாகக் கொண்டு இக்கணக்கீடு அமைகிறது. அல்லது இடைவினைபுரியும் இரண்டு பொருட்கள் வெகுதொலைவில் இருப்பதைப்போன்ற அமைப்பினைக் கொண்டுள்ளது. கதிர்வீச்சு ஆற்றல் மற்றும் ஒலி ஆற்றல் போன்ற அலை ஆற்றல்கள், இயக்க ஆற்றல், ஓய்வுநிலை ஆற்றல் முதலானவை ஒவ்வொன்றும் பூச்சியத்திற்குச் சமமாக அல்லது அதிகமாக இருக்கும். ஏனெனில் இவை அடிப்படை நிலை அளவாக பூச்சியத்தை ஒப்பிட்டு முறையே அலையற்ற, இயக்கமற்ற, சடத்துவமற்ற நிலையில் கணக்கிடப்படுகின்றன. வரலாறு ஆற்றல் என்ற பொருள் கொண்ட energy என்ற சொல் பண்டைய கிரேக்க மொழியில் ἐνέργεια, செயல்பாடு என்ற பொருள் கொண்ட சொல்லில் இருந்து வந்துள்ளது [2]. இச்சொல்லின் பயன்பாடு கி.மு. 4 ஆம் நூற்றாண்டில் அரிசுடாட்டிலின் படைப்பில் முதல் முறையாக தோன்றியிருப்பதாக அறியப்படுகிறது. நவீன வரையறைக்கு முரணாக ஆற்றல் என்பது மகிழ்ச்சி, ஆனந்தம் போன்ற பண்பு சார்ந்த ஒரு தத்துவ கருத்தாக அன்று கருதப்பட்டது. 17 ஆம் நூற்றாண்டின் பிற்பகுதியில், கோட்ஃபிரைட் லீப்னிசு இலத்தீன் மொழியில் vis viva என்ற கருத்தை முன்மொழிந்தார். ஒரு பொருளின் நிறையை அதன் திசைவேகத்தின் வர்கத்தால் பெருக்கினால் கிடைக்கும் அளவே ஆற்றல் என்று அவர் கூறினார். இம்முழு ஆற்றலும் காப்புற்ற அளவு என்றும் அவர் நம்பினார். உராய்வுடன் ஆற்றலை ஒப்பிட்ட, லீப்னிசு, பரு பொருள்களின் பகுதிகளான உட்கூறுகளின் சீரற்ற இயக்கத்தால் வெப்ப ஆற்றல் தோன்றுகிறது என்று கருதினார். இக்கோட்பாடு பொதுவாக ஒரு நூற்றாண்டுக்கு மேல்வரையிலும் ஏற்றுக்கொள்ளப்பட்டது. தற்கால இதனையொத்த இயக்க ஆற்றல் இரண்டு காரணிகளால் வேறுபடுகிறது. In 1807, Thomas Eng replaced the term vis viva with its modern meaning [3]. In 1829, Kusudave-Cassupard used the Coriolis kinetic energy with its modern meaning. William Rankin coined and used the term potential energy in 1853. The law of non-destruction of energy was proposed in the early 19th century. This is applicable to any isolated system. The debate over whether heat is a physically relevant substance continued for some years. Considered a quantity such as the calorie or momentum. The connection between mechanical work and heat generation was discovered in 1845 by Yemsu Prasukhot Yule. Such developments led to the theory of the indestructibility of energy. Mostly William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) formalized the field of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics facilitated the rapid development of chemical processes by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walter Nernschut. Also, the department helped introduce Claudius' theory of entropy formation and Joseph Stephen's laws of radiative energy. Noether's quantifiable dependence theorem states that energy is invariant over time[4]. Hence since 1918 the law of non-destruction of energy has been understood by theorists as a quantum measure of direct motion proportional to time. Units of Energy In 1843 Yemsu Presukot Yule discovered the mechanical equilibrium of heat through a series of experiments. Many of the most famous used Yule's apparatus: a weight attached to a wire that rotates an insulated paddle submerged in water to prevent heat transfer. This device shows that the gravitational force lost by the weight is equal to the internal force exerted by the water due to the friction of the paddle. The unit of energy in the International System of Units is the joule. The planet got its name because of its discovery by Yemsu Presukhot Yule. A joule is equal to the energy expended to move a distance of one meter using one newton of force. However, apart from the International System of Units, various units such as erg, calorie, British thermal unit, kilowatt-hour, kilocalorie are used to measure heat energy. When using these scales a conversion factor is necessary to express them in international units. Watt is the unit of power rating in the International System of Units. (ie energy per unit time) which is one joule per second. So, one joule equals one watt-second and 3600 joules equals one watt-hour. The unit of energy in the centimeter-gram-second system is the erg. In the US imperial system of measurement, this is called a foot-pound. Apart from these, units like electron volt, calorie food, kilocalorie are used in certain areas of science and commerce. Scientific Uses Energy is a conceptual and mathematical utility in classical physics. Because it is a protected quantity. Many formulas have been developed in mechanics using energy as a key tool. Work is a form of energy that bridges time and distance. W = ∫ C F ⋅ d s {\displaystyle W=\int_{C}\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}} Work (W) is the linear summation equal to the integration of the force F along the path C. Work and energy are related to a frame. For example, suppose a ball is hit by a bat. The bat doesn't do any work on the ball. But sufficient work is done on the ball by the bowler. The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian. This energy got its name because it was discovered by William Rowan Hamilton. Classical Equations of Motion The classical equations of motion can be written in Hamiltonian terms even for very complex or compact systems. These classical equations have significant direct analogies with non-relativistic quantum mechanics [5]. Another energy-related theory is the Ilagrangian theory discovered by Joseph-Louis Ilagrangian. In this method also the basics of Hamilton's theory are followed. In both these theories the equations of motion are derived or derived. Although this theory was found to challenge classical mechanics, it is very useful for modern physics. Usually obtained by subtracting the static energy from the kinetic energy is called the Ilograngian. Ilacrangean theory is considered more convenient for mathematics than Hamiltonian theory. Noidhar's theorem, developed in 1918, states that the operation of any physical system with a classifiable symmetry has an associated conservation law. Noida's theorem became a fundamental tool for modern theoretical physics and mathematical differentiation.

"Banking in India first began in the closing decades of the eighteenth century. The oldest bank in India is the State Bank of India, which started functioning in June 1806. State Bank of India is a state-owned bank and the country's largest commercial bank. The Reserve Bank of India, which has assumed the responsibilities of central banking, in 1935, after formally taking over these responsibilities from the then Imperial Bank of India, demoted it to a commercial bank. After India's independence in 1947, the Reserve Bank was nationalized and given vast powers. In 1969, the Indian government nationalized 14 of the largest commercial banks; Similarly, in 1980, six more of the next largest banks were nationalized. Currently, there are 96 Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India – 27 public sector banks (i.e., Government of India bonds themselves), 31 private banks (which are not government-bonded; publicly listed and authorized to trade on stock exchanges). ) and 38 foreign banks. Although they all operate independently, they form a unified network with a total of 53,000 branches and 17,000 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). According to a report by ICRA Limited, a rating agency, public sector banks hold 75% of the total assets of the banking industry, while private and foreign banks hold 18.2% and 6.5% respectively. Early history Banking in India first began in the closing decades of the eighteenth century. Although The General Bank of India and Bank of Hindustan were first established in 1786, they are now defunct. State Bank of India is the oldest bank operating in India. It first emerged from the Bank of Calcutta in June 1806. Then immediately became Bank of Bengal. The bank was one of the three premier provincial banks established under a charter granted by the British East India Company. The other two banks are Bank of Bombay and Bank of Madras. All three had been functioning as semi-central banks as central banks for many years. The banks that came after that also operated in the same way. In 1921 the three banks merged to form the Imperial Bank of India. Later after independence of India, all three became State Bank of India. Union Bank was established in 1839 by Indian merchants in Kolkata. But due to economic crisis in 1848-49, it failed in 1848. Established in 1865 and operating till date, The Allahabad Bank is the oldest joint venture bank in India. However, it is not the first bank. Credit goes to the Bank of Upper India. It came into existence in 1863 and lasted until 1913, when it failed and some of its assets and liabilities were transferred to the Alliance Bank of Shimla. When cotton exports from the Confederate States to Lancashire were banned due to the American Civil War, financiers started banks to lend money to the Indian cotton trade. Most of the banks started in India during that period failed due to giving too much space to speculative ventures. As a result, the financiers lost their money and also lost the interest earned on their deposits in the banks. As a result, banking in India remained the exclusive domain of Europeans for many years until the early twentieth century. During the 1860s, foreign banks opened branches, especially in Kolkata. In 1860 The Compoditre d'Escompte de Paris opened a branch in Kolkata and in 1862 a branch in Bombay; Subsequently, branches were opened in Madras and the then French settlement of Pondicherry. HSBC established itself in Bengal in 1869. Due to the trade of the British Empire, Kolkata became the busiest port in India and became a banking center. The Auth Commercial Bank, established in Faizabad in 1881, was the first fully fledged Indian joint capital bank. It failed in 1958. Next, the Punjab National Bank, which was established in 1895 in Lahore, is still standing today and is now one of the largest banks in India. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the Indian economy was in a period of stability. After a gap of five decades after the Indian Mutiny, society, industry and other infrastructures were well developed. Indians often set up small banks to benefit communities belonging to a particular caste and religion. While the Rajdhani banks dominated the banking industry, a few currency exchange banks and a number of Indian joint venture banks were established. Banks of all types operated in various sectors of the economy. Exchange banks, mostly owned by Europeans, focused exclusively on financing foreign trade. In general, Indian joint venture banks were undercapitalized and lacked sufficient experience or maturity to compete with sovereign and currency exchange banks. This division led Lord Curzon to say that ""we are very behind the times as far as banking is concerned. We are like old-fashioned cruise ships divided by heavy wooden partitions into crowded cabins"". From 1906 to 1911, the intervening period saw the emergence of banks inspired by the Swadeshi movement. Local businessmen and political elites were the impetus behind the Swadeshi movement to establish banks of and for the Indian community. Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, and Central Bank of India are still functioning today. Encouraged by the Swadeshi movement, several banks emerged in the combined Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts under the name of South Kanara District (South Kanara). Four nationalized banks were started in this district. And a leading private sector bank is also located here. Hence the undivided Dakshina Kannada district was called the ""Cradle of Indian Banking"". World War I (1914-1918) followed by World War II (1939-1945) and the two years before India's independence were challenging for the Indian banking industry. In the tumultuous First World War years, the failed banks were victims of the war, even though the Indian economy was indirectly boosted by war economic activity. Between 1913 and 1918, at least 94 banks in India failed, as illustrated in the following table: The post-independence partition of India in 1947 had adverse effects on the economy of the provinces of Punjab and West Bengal, to the extent that banking operations were paralyzed for months. India's independence brought an end to the reign of unregulated commercial theory in the banking industry. The Government of India has stepped up measures to actively participate in the economic life of the country. Also, the Industrial Policy Resolution of the government in 1948 envisaged a mixed economy. This had the effect of increasing state involvement in various sectors of the economy, including banking and finance. The following important regulatory measures were taken to regulate the banking industry: In 1948, the Reserve Bank of India, the central banking authority of India, was nationalized as an institution owned by the Government of India. In 1949, the Banking Regulation Act was passed and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was given all necessary powers to ""regulate, control and supervise all banks in India"". Under the Banking Regulation Act, a new bank or a branch of an existing bank is required to obtain permission from the Reserve Bank of India. It also prohibited having common directors in more than one bank. However, despite these agreements, restrictions and regulations, banks other than the State Bank of India continued to be privately owned. This situation changed drastically on 19 July 1969 when the government nationalized the major banks. Nationalization In the 1960s, the Indian banking industry became a vital tool for the development of the Indian economy. At the same time, there were talks about nationalizing the banking sector as the country's progress, so that the banking sector could emerge as a sector that offers a lot of job opportunities. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, expressed the Indian government's intention in a speech entitled ""Scattered Thoughts on Nationalizing Banks"" at the All India Congress Annual Conference. The concept received a positive response. Thereafter, his action was swift and unexpected. The Government of India enacted an ordinance nationalizing fourteen major commercial banks from midnight on July 19, 1969. Jayaprakash Narayan, a national leader of India, described the move as ""a masterful act of political prudence"". Parliament passed the Banking Companies (Capture and Transfer of Liability) Bill within two weeks of promulgation of the Ordinance and received the President's assent on 9 August 1969. A second nationalization of six more commercial banks followed in 1980. The reason for doing so was to increase the government's control over lending. After the second nationalization, the Indian government controlled 91% of the country's banking business. Later, in 1993, the government merged New Bank of India with Punjab National Bank. It was the only merger between nationalized banks. Thus, the number of nationalized banks decreased from 20 to 19. After this, till the 1990s, the nationalized banks saw a growth rate of 4% which offset the average growth rate of the Indian economy. Home Minister B. Chidambaram and others have credited nationalized banks with helping the Indian economy survive the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.[1][2] Liberalization In the early 1990s, the then Narasimha Rao government embarked on a policy of liberalisation. Accordingly, a small number of private banks were licensed to set up. These provided the new generation of techno-banking. The line included Global Trust Bank (the first new generation bank) and later Oriental Bank of Commerce, Axis Bank (initially UTI Bank), ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. Such a new move, along with the rapid growth of the Indian economy, reinvigorated the rapidly growing Indian banking sector with a strong contribution from three segments of banks: government banks, private banks and foreign banks. The next move for the Indian banking industry came with a plan to ease regulations on foreign direct investment. This allows foreign investors to have more voting rights than the current 10%. It currently reaches up to 74% with some limitations. This new policy completely shook the banking industry in India. Bankers till now were accustomed to the 4-6-4 (borrowing 4%; lending 6%; returning home at 4). This new wave introduced a modern look and technical know-how in the work of traditional banks. All these made the retail business boom in India. People not only expect more from their banks but also get more from them. At present (2007), the Indian banking industry is well matured in terms of provision, product line, and targeting in general, although reaching rural India remains a major challenge for private banks and foreign banks. In terms of asset quality and capital adequacy, Indian banks have cleaner, stronger, and transparent reserve positions than other banks in their region. The Reserve Bank of India is an autonomous organization with minimal government intervention. India's policy with respect to the Indian rupee is to deal with its volatility without any fixed exchange rate – and this is often the case. As the Indian economy, particularly the services sector, is expected to grow and strengthen for some time, demand for banking services, particularly retail banking, mortgage, and investment services, is also expected to remain strong. Activities such as mergers and acquisitions among companies may be encouraged. In March 2006, the Reserve Bank of India allowed Warburg Pincus to increase its exposure to Kotak Mahindra Bank (a private sector bank) by 10%. An investor allowed a private sector bank to increase its leverage by more than 5%. This is the first time. Because in 2005, RBI announced certain norms that any private sector bank should have more than 5% of debt securities rated by them. In recent years, critics have denounced non-government banks as aggressive in trying to collect home loans, car loans and private loans. [3][4][5] Newspaper reports have suggested that bank debt collection efforts are driving people who are powerless to repay their debts to commit suicide.[3][4][5] Additional reading ""Growth of State Bank of India"" (Imperial Bank of India Period, 1921-1955) (Volume III) ""Banking Frontiers"" - A monthly magazine, published by Global Informed from Mumbai.

"Largest organisms are defined by various measurements such as volume, mass, height, and length. Some organisms are not classified as macroorganisms even though they are found together as macroorganisms. For example, the world's largest coral reef, the Great Barrier Reef, is a complex of many species, so it is not classified as a large species. Esuppan trees originate from a root that comes from a mother plant. A group of sycamore trees have a single connected rhizome underground. Thus, the largest subterranean sycamore grove is the Bando tree in the US state of Utah.[1] According to some scholars it is the world's largest living creature by mass or mass.[2] It covers a total area of ​​0.43 square kilometers (km²) (106 acres). Its estimated mass is 6000 tonnes.[3] The honey mushroom (Armillaria ostoyae), a giant fungus found in the Mellor National Forest in the US state of Oregon, has an estimated area of ​​8.9 square kilometers (km²) (2,200 acres)[4]. This makes it the largest living organism in the world by area. There is disagreement as to whether it is a single species or a subspecies. Based on some experiments it has the same genome [5], but the mycelium of the honeydew can be considered a clonal colony of several individual fungi if not connected. ) of the elongated sea urchin (Posidonia oceanica) is larger than the honeydew mushroom.[6] A large plant Apart from the multi-stemmed trees, the giant sequoia, known locally as the General Sherman, has a volume of 1,487 m3 (52,500 cu ft) and can be considered the largest species by volume.[7] The 83.8 meters (m) (275 ft) tall tree is estimated to weigh 1,800 tonnes with its trunk alone. The largest single-stemmed tree ever measured is a giant sequoia tree called Linsey Creek, with a volume of at least 2,500 cubic meters (m3) (88,000 cubic feet) and a stem weighing 3,300 tons. It fell to the ground during a storm in 1905.[8] Largest animal The largest animal in terms of volume and weight is now the closest living species, the blue whale. A blue whale has a measured length of 33.58 meters (110.2 ft) and a mass of 210 US tons (pregnant whale). African elephants are the largest land-dwelling animals. The following table lists the top ten heaviest animals: Largest land animal A marked green one weighed 12,272 kilograms. Many animals that are now extinct, including many anthomas, were found to be larger than greens. Great Bacillus The largest bacterium known so far is Thiomargarita namibiensis. It can grow up to 0.75mm. It is visible to the naked eye. Sources Category: Organisms ",What is the largest mammal on earth?,green,2605
"Computer software or software is a general term used primarily for computer programs and data that can be read and written by computers and stored numerically, such as other types of information. Today the term also includes data not normally associated with a computer, such as film reels, tapes, and recordings.[1] The term is coined to contrast with the older term hardware (i.e. physical devices); Software, as opposed to hardware, refers to the intangible, meaning ""untouchable"".[2] Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, i.e. application software. Examples: Application software, such as word processors that do useful work for users. A software-programmable enclosure for electronically programmable memory devices such as firmware, embedded motherboards, or other types of integrated hardware conductors. The core program controls and coordinates distributed systems. System software consists of computing resources and operating platforms that provide convenience to users. Software testing is a field of development and programming. Software testing includes several methods of testing and declaring a software product suitable before it is released for use by an individual or group. Testing software is a general term or container term for all applications and application software that function concurrently with testing a software module, but are not necessarily optional for contributing functional purposes. Similarly, a test program is not a static script but a working environment for the application software or its components. Video games (excluding hardware) Websites Overview Software includes the various forms and roles that digitally stored data can have and run on a computer (or similar system), regardless of whether the data is used as a code or other object descriptor for the CPU, or whether it represents some other type of information. Software thus encompasses a wide range of products that can be developed using various techniques such as conventional programming languages, scripting languages, microcoding or FPGA. This type of software includes web pages created in languages ​​and design languages ​​like HTML, PHP, Perl, JSP, ASP.NET, XML, and desktop applications like OpenOffice and Microsoft Word written in languages ​​like C, C++, Java, C# or Smalltalk. includes Application software usually runs on embedded operating platforms such as Linux or Microsoft Windows. Software (or firmware) is used in video games and in the design components of the logic systems of vehicles, televisions, and other consumer electronic devices. Computer software is so-called to distinguish it from computer hardware (hardware), which includes the built-in interfaces and peripherals required to store and execute (or execute) the software. Minimal implementation code includes machine language instructions for individual implementations. A machine language contains groups of binary values ​​that specify executable instructions that change the state of the computer from a previous state. Programming dictates a sequence of instructions to change the state of the computer in a particular sequence. It is usually written in high-level programming languages ​​(such as natural languages) that are easier for humans to use and more useful than machine languages. High-level languages ​​are compiled or interpreted into machine language target code. Software can also be written in assembly language, specifically the mnemonic expression of machine language that uses the natural language alphabet. Assembly language must be compiled into object code via a compiler. The term ""software"" was first used in this context by John W. Turkey in 1958.[3] In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all computer programs. The theory underlying most modern software was first proposed by Alan Turing in 1935 in his paper Computable Numbers with Applications to Numsteidungsproblem (decisional mathematics).[4] Types of Software Practical computer systems divide software systems into three main categories: system software, programming software, and application software, although this distinction remains arbitrary and ambiguous. System Software System software helps operate the computer hardware and the computer system. It includes the following links: Device drivers Operating platform servers benefits Window Systems The purpose of system software is to reduce the burden on the applications programmer since the details of the particular computer being used remain complex, including accessories such as communication devices, printing devices, device readers, displays, and keyboards, and the allocation of memory and processor to computing resources in a safe and stable manner. Examples – Windows XP, Linux, and Mac OS X. Programming software Programming software usually provides tools to assist the programmer in writing computer programs and software that uses different programming languages ​​in a more convenient way. These tools include: compilers Teabaggers Interpreters Linkers Text editors An integrated development environment (IDE) is a single application that attempts to handle all of these functions. Application software Application software enables users to accomplish one or more specific (directly related to computer development) tasks. Typical applications include: Industrial Automation Business software Video games Microwave Chemistry and Solid State Physics Software Communications (ie the Website and all Content); Databases Educational software (these are now gaining popularity in India) Medical software Military software Molecular modeling software Image editing Video editing Spreadsheet Counterfeit software Word processing Decision making software 3D graphics software Accounting software Payroll software There are application software for a wide range of topics and influence them. Construction of Software Topics Users view these differently than programmers. In modern general-purpose computers (as opposed to embedded systems, analog computers, and supercomputers), users see three layers of software: platform, application, and user software that perform different tasks: . Platform Software: A platform includes software, device drivers, an operating platform, and typically a graphical user interface, which collectively enables the user to interact with the computer and its peripherals (connected devices). The site software comes bundled with the computer. You have the ability to change site software as you normally would on a PC. Application Software: When thinking of software, most users think of application software or applications. Typical examples are office suites and video games. Application software is always purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes apps come bundled with a computer, but that doesn't change the fact that they work as individual apps. Applications are usually programs that are separate from the operating system, although they are designed for specific platforms. Most users think of binaries, databases, and other ""system software"" as applications. User-written software: An end-user developer designs systems to meet the user's specific needs. User software includes spreadsheet templates, word processors [Platform software: A platform includes software, device drivers, an operating system, and typically a graphical user interface, all of which allow the user to interact with the computer and its peripherals (integrated device). The Site Software comes bundled with the system. You are given the ability to replace the site software on a PC. Email splitters are also a type of user software. Users develop this software themselves and oversee how advanced it is. Depending on how well user-written software is integrated into automated application packages, many users may not know the difference between native packages and those added by collaborators. Documentation Most software has software documentation so that the end user understands what a program does and how to use it. Software without clear documentation can be difficult to use – especially when it's highly specialized and complex software like Photoshop or AutoCAD. There may also be developer documentation, which may be notes and/or separate documents detailing how these programs work and how they can be improved. The fact that a library is an executable is not always complete enough for direct implementation. Software libraries contain functions and sets of functions that can be integrated with other applications. Many standard software libraries and applications, including operating platforms, are distributed within their own libraries. Software standards are needed because software is designed in different programming languages, operating platforms, and operating environments so that different software can understand each other and exchange information. For example, if an email is sent from Microsoft Outlook it should be read by Yahoo!Mail and vice versa. Implementation Computer software is uploaded ""into the computer's storage"" (hard disk, memory, or RAM). Once the software is loaded the computer acquires the ability to execute the software. It carries instructions from the application software through the system software to the hardware that finally receives the machine code. Each instruction causes the computer to perform an action—including moving data, performing calculations, or changing the flow of control of instructions. Data movement is the transfer of data from one location in memory to another. Sometimes it is also associated with transferring data from memory to registers to make data access on the CPU more efficient. Moving data can be costly, especially for large volumes. Therefore, this is sometimes avoided by using ""pointers"" instead of data. Calculations also include simple operations such as incrementing the value of variable data elements. More complex computations may involve multiple functions and data elements interacting in an integrated manner. Quality and Reliability Software quality is important, especially for business and system software such as Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. A software bug (if it contains a bug) can destroy and corrupt one's work and do unexpected things. Mistakes and errors are called ""bugs"". Many bugs are discovered and cleared (debugged) through software testing. However, software testing rarely—if ever—clears every page; Some programmers say that ""every program is incomplete without at least one page"" (Lupersky's rule). All major companies, such as Microsoft, Novell, and Sun Microsystems, have software testing departments with the specific goal of testing. Software is tested through unit testing, regression testing, and other methods, which can be done manually or, more commonly, automatically, as the code being tested can be large. NASA, for example, has very strict software testing procedures for many operating platforms and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations are interoperable and identified through command programs called software. This allows many users working at NASA to evaluate operational systems as a whole. Programs that include command software combine hardware engineering and system functions to make implementation much easier. License A license to software gives the user the right to use that software in the licensed environment. Some software comes with a license when purchased from a store or comes with an OEM license when it comes with hardware. Other software comes with a free software license that gives the recipient rights to develop and distribute the software. Software also comes in the form of freeware or shareware. Copyrights Software may be proprietary; However, there are conflicting views in the software industry regarding software patents. The paradox of software patents is that a particular process or technique contained in a piece of software cannot be imitated by others and is considered intellectual property and patent infringement depending on its severity. Design and Implementation The design and implementation of software depends on the complexity of the software. For example, the design and development of Microsoft Word software is much more time-consuming than Microsoft Notepad because the functions involved in each are different. Software is typically designed and developed (coding/writing/programming) in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IMAX, and Microsoft Visual Studio, which can facilitate this process and program compilation. As mentioned in various sections, software is built on existing software and application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide embedded software such as GTK+, JavaBeans, or Swing. Libraries (APIs) are categorized for different purposes. For example, the JavaBeans library is used to design enterprise applications, the Windows Forms library is used to design a graphical user interface (GUI) like Microsoft Word, and the Windows Communication Foundation is used to create Web services. Intrinsic computer programming concepts such as QuickChart, HashTable, Array, and Binary Tree can be useful for developing software. When a program is designed it relies on the API. For example if a user is designing a Microsoft Windows desktop application he can use the .NET Windows Forms library to create that desktop application and he will call its API as follows form1.Close() and form1.Show() [5] to open and close the application and it should have Also writes additional functions. Without these APIs the programmer would have to write these APIs automatically. Companies such as Sun Microsystems, Novell, and Microsoft provide their own APIs, so many applications are written using proprietary software libraries that contain many APIs within themselves. Software with special economic characteristics has a form, creation, and distribution that differs from other economic goods.[6][7] Being called a software developer, programmer, software engineer, software developer or code monkey all mean the same thing. Organizations and Organizations Software has its own industry called the software industry and it is made up of various companies and individuals who develop software and as a result has provided many software companies and programmers in the world. Such software companies and individuals specialize in specific fields as software is increasingly being used in various fields such as finance, search, mathematics, aerospace, sports and mining. For example, electronic arts mainly produce video games. Selling software is also a lucrative industry. For example, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, was the world's richest man in 2009 due to sales of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office software programs. Similarly, Larry Ellison became rich through his Oracle database software. There are also non-profit software organizations such as the Free Software Movement, QNU, and Mozilla Firefox. There are software standards organizations such as W3C, IETF, and others such as XML, HTML, MySQL, or File Transfer Protocol. Some of the well known software companies are Microsoft, Oracle, Novell, SAP, Symantec, Adobe Systems and Corel.

"Pottery is a type of clay that humans use for their deities Pottery generally refers to objects made of clay. Pottery making techniques have been traced back to ancient times. Pottery making is a very ancient profession in many parts of the world. This profession is known as Kuyath Vray in Tamil and the potters are known as ""Kuyavar"". Pottery is made by mixing water and powdered soil into the desired shape and heating it to a high temperature in a kiln. By heating in this way, permanent changes occur in the clay, such as compaction, increased strength, and firmness of shape. As the clay used for making pottery differs from place to place, the pottery made in those places also has unique characteristics. Some other minerals are also added to the clay soil for some specific needs. History A large part of the history of pottery is related to prehistoric, pre-literate archaic culture. Therefore, much of this history is derived from artifacts found in archeology. Because pottery has a very long life span, potsherds and sherds have survived for thousands of years and are found at archaeological sites. Before pottery art or pottery can become part of a culture, several stages must usually be met. They are, First, you need to get a suitable clay for making pottery. Archaeological sites where the earliest pottery has been found are located in close proximity to locations with readily available sources of clay suitable for proper shaping and firing. Because China has a wide variety of clays, they have had the opportunity to be pioneers in pottery or art. Not only China but also many other countries have large deposits of various types of clay. Second, there must be room for the temperature to build up the transformation from raw clay to firing. Methods for reliably generating temperatures suitable for firing pottery are not known to have been developed until later in the culture's development. Third, there must have been sufficient time to prepare, shape, and kiln-fire the pottery. Even after humans learned to control fire, humans did not learn to make pottery until they became settled. It is possible to assume that pottery was developed after humans specialized in agriculture and led to permanent settlements. However, the earliest known pottery dates from China as early as 20,000 BC, indicating that agriculture may have been known. Fourth, resources for producing pottery can only be justified if there was a need for its production.[1] Raw Materials The primary mineral found in clay is kaolinite; Clay can generally be characterized as containing 40% aluminum oxide, 46% silicon oxide, and 14% water. Two types of clay are found in nature. They are called primary and secondary clays. Primary clay is found in place of the rock from which it is derived. Because it is not transported by running water or glaciers, it is not mixed with other sediments. Primary clay is heavy, dense and pure. Secondary, or alluvial clay, forms as lighter silt that is submerged and stored. This secondary clay, a silty mixture, is finer and lighter than the primary clay. Different additives give different properties to clay.[2] Below is a list of different types of clay used for pottery industry.[3] Bronze Clay or Kaolinite: Because it was first used in China, it is sometimes called China clay. It is used in the manufacture of ceramics. Ball Clay: A very flexible, fine-grained, silty clay that may contain some organic matter. Small amounts are added during the manufacture of ceramic to increase its flexibility. Fire clay: This type of clay contains a slightly lower percentage of aggregates than white clay, but has regular and adequate flexibility. This type of clay is heat resistant and mixing it with other types of clay increases the heat resistance of the clay. Makkal Pantak Clay: This type of clay is suitable for making Makkal varieties. The properties of this clay lie between those of fire clay and those of ball clay. This type of clay is found in fine particles like ball clay and heat resistant like fire clay. Common red clays and sale clays contain plant and ferric oxide impurities, which are useful for making bricks, but only certain deposits are suitable for making ceramics under special conditions. Also, generally, such clays are not suitable for making pottery.[4] Bentonite clay is highly flexible. This type of clay is added to other types of clay to increase its flexibility. The clay objects acquire different physical properties during the steps of production to create ceramics. Green pottery refers to unfired items. Materials are highly flexible in this condition with sufficient moisture. (i.e. soft, malleable and malleable) Skin-hardness refers to the condition of a partially dried clay material. At this stage, the clay material is found to have a moisture content of approximately 15%. Clay products found in this condition are very firm and only slightly malleable. Blackening and handle additions are performed at the skin-hardening level. A very dry (dry) condition refers to a condition where the moisture content has reached 0% or very close to it. Pottery in this stage is kiln-fired to achieve a light brown colour. Fired clay [5][6] refers to the condition in which the material is first fired into the kiln after being brought into the desired shape. Indicates the state of being baked to the extent of a loaf or bread. Kiln firing thus changes the clay material in many ways. The mineral components in the clay material undergo chemical change and change the color of the material. Glazed or glazed fired clay is the final stage in pottery making. A type of firing glaze applied to the fired clay. Also, pottery is decorated in many different ways. The condition of the pottery thus obtained is that of glazed fired clay. Glazing glaze adheres well to the fuse when fired. Such polishing and firing makes the object harder. Methods of shaping Pottery is shaped using a variety of methods. Some of them are: Handcrafting: This is the primitive method. Clay objects are fashioned from coils of clay. Clay objects are made by joining flat layers of clay or by kneading and binding solid balls of clay or by combining these two methods. Thus the parts of the hand-crafted vessels are often joined together with the help of an accessory called a slip, with a hanging mixture of clay and water. An object made of clay may be decorated before firing or after firing. Potter's Wheel: In a process called ""throwing,"" the clay is placed in the center of a spinning platform in an area called the wheelhead. The potter rotates the wheel at the required speed with a stick using the force of his legs or using an electric motor. During this process, as the wheel rotates, a solid ball of fine clay is pressed, squeezed, and gently pulled upward and outward to form a vacuum. The first step is to press the uneven clay ball downwards and inwards using symmetrical rotation to center the clay. This is the most important and highly skilled step.Opening (forming a hollow sphere with an opening in the center from a ball of solid clay), leveling (forming a flat circular bottom on the inside of the pot), throwing or pulling (spreading the walls of the pot from the inside of the pot to a uniform thickness) and flattening (unnecessary or (removal of excess clay to exact shape) requires considerable skill and experience to handle the throwing process on the potter's wheel.

"The Indus Valley Civilization is an ancient civilization that flourished in places like Mesopotamia, China, and is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. This civilization flourished around the Indus River in present-day Pakistan and had influence over a vast area. This civilization, which was at its peak between 3000 BC and 2500 BC, suddenly died out due to some unknown reason. There is no consensus among researchers about the people who lived here or the languages ​​they spoke. A large number of seals found in archeological excavations are still unreadable, and the symbols used to write their language are still unreadable.[2] The origin and development of the Indus Valley Civilization It is said that there were settlements and small towns in the Indus Valley region as early as 6000 BC. Mehergar region in Baluchistan and the armies under Harappa are proof of this claim. However, these were small towns and city-states with independent administrations and self-sufficient economies. During what is now known as the Harappan Civilization, the Indus Valley Civilization grew to cover an area of ​​about 13 million square kilometers (5 million square miles), the largest ever seen in any other civilization of the time. There were roughly more than 200 towns and 6 major cities. The characteristic structure of these cities and settlements shows that they were all under a single administration capable of social integration at a high level of development. The Harappan culture, a chronological classification of the Indus Valley culture, existed from 2600 to 1900 BC. It can be considered that it started from 33rd – 14th centuries BC, when we look at the cultures that existed before and after it, namely the earlier and later Harappan cultures. There are two types of classification regarding the chronology of the Indus Valley Civilization. One is Eras and the other is Phases. Population There is still no evidence to know with certainty the caste of the people who lived outside the Indus. However, researchers have put forward various conflicting views. Many others have put forward a variety of hybrid theories to say that people belonging to the outer Indus culture are Dravidian, while others say that they are not Aryans. Economy The economy of the Indus Valley Civilization was largely based on trade. This is due to great advancements in transportation technology. The Indus Valley Civilization may have been the first to use the wheel.[3] Bullock carts and boats that can be seen throughout South Asia today may have been used then. Boats were often found in small flat forms and were probably powered by sails. Archaeologists have discovered a massive deep canal in Lothal, a coastal city in Gujarat, western India. It is believed to have been used as a shipyard. Also H. P. Frankfort discovered a massive network of canals used for irrigation. During the Chalcolithic (Copper Age) period between 4300–3200 BCE, ceramic wares found in the Indus Valley Civilization regions correspond to ceramic wares found in southern Turkmenistan and northern Iran. It is assumed that the Indus Valley people may have been involved in trade with those regions. Early Harappan period (ca. 3200–2600 BCE) pottery, seals, figurines, ornaments, etc., indicate significant trade with Central Asia and the Iranian plateau.[4] Judging by the distribution of Indus Civilization artefacts, it can be seen that trade contacts took place over a wide area. These areas include parts of Afghanistan, coastal areas of Persia, northern and western India, and Mesopotamia. There is also some evidence of commercial contacts extending as far as Crete and Egypt.[5] As early as the Middle Harappan period, massive seaborne trade activity was observed between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilizations. Most of these commercial activities were carried out by the ""middle merchants of Dilmun"" (modern-day Bakrain and Bailaqa regions on the Persian Gulf).[6] Such long-distance sea trade was made possible by plank-built, single-masted sailing boats. Coastal settlements such as Chotkajen-Tor (astride Dast river north of Jiwani), Chokta Koh (astride Shadi river north of Pasni) and Balakot (near Sonmiani) in Pakistan and Lothal in India bear evidence of Harappan trading posts. Shallow harbors located in estuaries close to the sea facilitated excellent trade activities with Mesopotamian cities. time None of the buildings associated with religious rites or places of worship have been found or identified in the archaeological survey. However, researchers have also identified religious concepts in the images and scenes depicted on small figurines and seals. For example, there is evidence of Hindu goddess worship, linga worship, the concept of Pashupati, sacrificial altars etc. Based on these, it is considered that many elements of modern Hinduism may have originated in the Indus period. Language No definite information has come to light about the language or languages ​​spoken by the people outside the Indus. There is no other evidence except that the symbolic forms considered to be the written forms of the language spoken here are found in abundance in the form of small stamps. Researchers who have been trying to read these letters for several decades have not yet succeeded, and recently some researchers have commented that these are not letters, but merely symbols. However, arguments about this continue to come. Researchers who believe that these are the scripts of the language spoken by the people of the Indus Valley, are unable to come to a consensus on which language this language belongs to. Today Indo-European languages ​​are the majority spoken throughout the region around the Indus Valley. However, since the speakers of this language are thought to have entered India around the time of the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, most researchers consider it to be a non-Indo-European language. At best, the idea that it belongs to the Dravidian language family is supported by many researchers. Some also believe that it may be a Munda language. In recent times, many North Indian researchers have tried to establish that Indus is an Indo-European language. In particular, many Hindu nationalists have extreme views on it, and the debates about it are becoming more political and emotional. City Structure and Architecture The Indus Valley Civilization had a complex, high-level urban culture. The character of the city organization found here shows the knowledge of local government system and city planning with emphasis on sanitation among these civilized people. The streets of major cities like Mohenjo Daro and Harappa are laid out in a regular grid system. Houses are constructed in such a way as to protect them from noise, stench and pest infestation. The sanitary systems found at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, and the recently discovered Rakhigarhi are the first urban sanitary systems in the world. In cities, houses obtained water from wells either individually or jointly with other neighboring houses. It has also come to light that separate rooms are reserved for bathing. Sewage was discharged from the houses through closed canals laid in the streets. The gates of the houses were placed in inner courtyards and small streets. The sewage and drainage systems found in all urban areas influenced by the ancient Indus Basin were not only as efficient as those found in contemporary Middle Eastern cities, but also superior to those found in parts of modern-day India and Pakistan. The architectural quality of the Indus Valley Civilization can be discerned from other structures such as landing platforms, granaries, granary blocks, brick construction platforms and defensive walls. The massive city defense fortifications were larger than most of the citadels found in Mesopotamia at the time. The reason for the construction of such forts is still debatable. Contrary to the contemporary cultures of this culture like Mesopotamia and Egypt, there are no gigantic monumental structures. Here, there is no conclusive evidence of the existence of palaces or temples, nor any information about kings, armies, clergy, etc. In one city, a well-constructed bathing pool is found, which is believed to be a public bathing place. Although the forts were surrounded by walls, it is not clear whether these were built for security reasons. They may also be built to prevent floodwaters from entering. Most of the townspeople seem to have been traders and artisans. Raw materials brought from distant places have been used to make seals, beads and various other items. Although some houses were larger than others, their general layout suggests that Indus urban society was largely egalitarian. Decline of the Indus Valley Civilization Around 1800 BC there are signs of a gradual decline of this culture. By 1700 BC most of the cities had been abandoned. However, the Indus Valley culture did not disappear completely. Many elements of this culture are found in later cultures as well. Current archaeological evidence suggests that the material culture, referred to as the Late Harappan culture, may have continued at least as far back as 1000 – 900 BC. It is also thought that the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization may have had natural causes related to climate change. .[7]The climate of the Indus Valley became noticeably cooler and drier from 1800 BC. A significant factor is also believed to be the disappearance of a significant part of the Ghaggar Hakra river system. However, the above hypothesis is not accepted by most of the people. The region lies along the route through which Aryans, Afghans, Turks, Mughals, etc. penetrated into South Asia through the passes of the Hindu Kush. Based on this, hypotheses related to the decline of the Indus outer culture and the Indo-Aryan migration of the Aryans into North India were explored. At the beginning of the 20th century it was presented as a ""Policy of Aryan Aggression"". The archeological evidence of its decline and the predictions of the Aryan influx lend credence to this theory. Also, the discovery of many burial pits with the marks of those who died in the war in the army added strength to this theory. Archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler noted that the Indo-Aryan war god Indra himself was ""blamed"" for the destruction. Today there are many other policies in place of this policy. Some Indian researchers, especially North Indian researchers, argue that the Aryans did not come into India from outside, that India was their homeland, and that the Indo-European languages ​​originated in India. Their argument is that the Indus Valley Civilization belongs to the Aryans. However, these words have not received international acceptance among scholars. Indus Valley Alphabets in Mayiladuthurai Indus Valley Alphabets In Mayiladuthurai in Nagapattinam district, a stone stele inscribed with Indus Valley alphabets was found in 2007. From this it seems that the people of Indus Valley and the Tamils ​​spoke the same language or branched languages ​​from the same mother tongue according to Iravatam Mahadevan.[8] Its period is B.C. 2000 - BC 1500.[9] Indus Valley Inscriptions on the Kavirikkara During recent excavations by the Department of Archeology in the Kavirik estuary area of ​​Tamil Nadu, more than ten ancient talismans have been found. Iravatham Mahadevan, a researcher studying ancient writings, has reported that some of the symbols found on these old people's Talis are similar to the symbols of the Indus Valley Civilization found at Harappa and Mohenjo Daro.[10] Indus Valley Civilization In the Indus Valley Civilization, the city of Moganjdaro is a sitting animal, hook, crossroad, and vase-shaped seals that were studied. In these, the animal shape indicates the barter system, the hook shape is buying, taking, the city and the village, which includes the crossroad street patterns. The vase shape is more common in the Indus Valley. This form found at the end of the word means an, city chief, pandi, pandiyan etc. Similar words are also found in Palanthami. When these 4 letters are read together, we get the sentence City Merchant. It can also be read as a modified Valuthipandian. Analyzing all this, inscription researcher Airavatham Mahadevan thinks that the Dravidian family language must have been spoken in the Indus Valley.[11] These civilized period wars are on display in the Chennai Museum.[12] See also Indus Valley/Harappan Taxonomy Indus Valley Architecture The language of the Indus Valley Civilization Harappa Mohenjo Daro Ragi Gargi Lothal Tolavira Meherkar Mundicak References Bibliography CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) CS1 maint: ref=harv (link) CS1 maint: ref=harv (link).

"Radium is a radioactive element with the atomic formula Ra. Its atomic number is 88. Its atomic mass is 226. Radium is the sixth element in column 2 of the periodic table. It is also classified as an alkaline metal. Pure radium is white in color like silver. But when exposed to air, radium readily reacts with nitrogen instead of oxygen to form a black surface layer called radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive. Among these, the most stable isotope is radium-226. Its half-life is 1600 years. This isotope decays radioactively into radon gas, specifically the isotope radon-222. Ionizing radiation is a byproduct when radium decays. It oxidizes the luminescent chemicals and produces radioluminescence. Radium in the form of radium chloride was discovered in 1898 by Maricuri and Pierrecuri. Radium was isolated from the mineral uranite at the French Academy of Sciences and published five days later. Marie Curie and Anne-Louis DePierre produced radium in its metallic state in 1911 by electrolysis of radium chloride.[1] In nature, radium is found in trace amounts in the minerals uranium and thorium. Radium is not an essential requirement for living organisms. Due to its radioactive and chemical reactivity, adverse health effects may occur when combined with biochemical processes. Radium has no commercial uses other than nuclear medicine. Earlier it was used as a radiation source for radiation devices. It is also considered a decongestant and has been used in radiopharmaceuticals. Radium is not used for such applications today. Because the toxicity of radium is realized today. So less toxic isotopes are used in these devices. Radium is the heaviest of the alkaline earth metals whose properties are known. And it is the only radioactive metal in that group. The physical and chemical properties of radium are similar to those of the element barium. Pure radium is a volatile element. It is white like silver, although calcium, isudrontium, and barium, which are considered to be its light co-elements, have a slight yellow tint. Its color fades quickly in air. Radium nitride reacts with air to form a black film on its surface. The melting point of radium can be either 700°C or 960°C. And its boiling point is 1737 degrees Celsius. Both of these quantities are smaller than barium. These quantities are also subject to periodic trends in the periodic table[2]. The elements of Group 2 show the same trend as we go from top to bottom of the table. Like barium and the alkali metals, radium crystallizes in a material-centered cubic form at normal temperature and pressure. The bond distance of a radium-radium bond is 514.8 picometres. Its density is 5.5 g/cm3. This is greater than the density of barium. The radium-barium density ratio is comparable to the radium-barium atomic mass ratio. Because both elements crystallize in the same crystal structure. Isotopes Radium has 33 isotopes with mass numbers 202 to 234. All these are radioactive. 223Ra with a half-life of 11.4 days, 224Ra with a half-life of 3.64 days, 226Ra with a half-life of 1600 years, and 228Ra with a half-life of 5.75 years are all from the decay chain of isotopes thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 Looks natural. The isotope 223Ra originates from the isotope uranium-235, the isotope 226Ra from the isotope uranium-235, and the other two isotopes from the isotope thorium 232.

"J.J. Sir Joseph John Thomson (December 18, 1856 - August 30, 1940), commonly known as Thomson (Joseph John Thomson), was an English physicist who discovered the electron, the fundamental element of the atom. He studied electricity, magnetism and isotopes. He is hailed as the 'Father of Modern Nuclear Physics'. Discoverer of the mass spectrum. He became a professor of physics and received the 'Adams Prize' for his research and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. His mother, Emma Swindell, and father, Joseph James Thomson, were from a Scottish family.[1] youth He was born in 1856 at 'Cheetham Hill' in Manchester, England. His parents belonged to a Scottish family. In 1870 he attended Owensboro College, Manchester, and then in 1876, Trinity College, Oxford. There he studied very well and won the 'Adamsu Paris' [2] . As a result, he was appointed as a member of the college till his last days. His father wanted him to become an engineer. But after the death of his father, his family was unable to pay the fees, so that wish was not fulfilled. Owensu College taught him the best professors and his scientific education was excellent. In 1883, he was appointed as a professor in the college itself. He was appointed Cavendish Laboratory Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Cambridge. Before him, Lord Raleigh was a professor in the work. From 1884 to 1918 he was appointed professor of economics at Cambridge and at the Royal Institution in London[3]. He also became a member of the Royal Society. In 1890 he married Rose Elizabeth. A son and a daughter were born to him. His son 'George Paget Thomson' became an outstanding professor of physics and later won the prize in 1937. Studies Thomson was the first to research the atom and published a treatise entitled ""Treatise on the motion of Vortex Rings"". It won him the Adamsu Prize in 1884. In 1886, he published a paper entitled 'Application of the Dynamics to Physics and Chemistry'. In 1892 he published the book 'Notes on Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism'. It was the third volume of James Clark Maxwell's book as an introduction to his book. Along with Prof. J.H.Poynting, he published a course in physics entitled 'Properties of Matter' in four volumes. Study of cathode rays Thomson was involved in the study of cathode rays with the help of a cathode ray tube. His first study was whether it was possible to isolate resistive particles from antielectron rays. With the help of an electrometer, he made several slits in the tube and examined it with the help of a magnetic field. He realized that it was impossible to separate the anti-electrons from these rays [4]. Secondly he investigated how these rays are affected by an electric field. He continued his research using the vacuum tube and luminescence. He thereby discovered that anti-electron rays are hit by an electric field [5]. Electron detection In the third study he sought to find the charge-mass ratio of the electron. He called anti-electron particles 'Corpuscles'. Later a scientist named Johnstone Stoney confirmed it as electronic [6]. From this came the fact that objects are electrically conductive. From this arose modern atomic theory and the explanation of physical effects associated with the atom. Hence he is hailed as the father of modern nuclear physics. In 1895 he published two books 'Elements of Mathematics' and 'Principles of Electricity and Magnetism'. They also published a fifth edition in 1921. In 1896 Thompson went to America. He delivered four lectures there based on his early studies. He announced his discovery of the electronic particle during an evening lecture at the Royal Society of London. He announced this on Friday, April 30, 1897. In 1903, he also published a book entitled ""Conduction of Electricity through Gases"". This book was later published in two editions (1928 and 1933) by his son George Thomson, entitled 'Thomson's Great Days at the Cavendish Laboratory'. He went back to America in 1904. He lectured at Yale University on materials and electricity. His ideas on the 'Structure of the Atom' were published. Isotopes and mass spectrometry Using the ideas of scientists such as Austen and Dempster to separate different types of atoms and molecules using electron beams, he explained a method that would help find many isotopes. Through his analysis of neon gas, he made it clear that certain elements are compounds of isotopes. Based on that, his students Asudan and Dempster created a mass spectrograph. In 1906 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his studies on the effects of passing electricity through gases in a discharge tube. He was involved in determining the number of electrons in atoms by measuring the amount of scattering of light, theria, beta and gamma rays. Similarly, he was also involved in researches on the nature of electro-particles. These studies helped his student Rutherford to continue his research. Books published The Structure of Light-1907 The Corpuscular Theory of Matter-1913 Positive Rays of Electricity-1913 The electron in Chemistry-1936 Recollection and Reflections (History)-1936 He wrote and published many books like specialties He was awarded the Order of Merit in 1908. In 1912, he became the President of the English Society. He was given a special membership of the Royal Society and then its president from 1916 to 1920. In 1918 he became Chancellor of Trinity College. He founded the Cavendish Research Institute there.

"Venus is the second planet from the Sun in the Solar System. Next to the moon in our night sky, silver is the brightest. Silver reaches its peak brightness before sunrise and after sunset. Hence it is called Morning Star, Dawn Star and Evening Star. Venus is the planet with the hottest atmosphere in the solar system. This is due to the additional pinewood effect. Its environment is inhospitable to living things. A Friday-Sunday cycle occurs every 224.7 Earth days.[14] This planet has no natural satellite. In European cases it is named after Venus, the goddess of beauty and love in Roman mythology. Indian languages ​​are named after Venus, the master of demons in Indian mythology. The star's apparent brightness on Earth is −4.6, so its light casts shadows.[15] As Venus is the innermost planet from Earth towards the Sun, it always appears to be closest to the Sun. Venus is a solid planet. Venus is sometimes called Earth's ""sister planet"" because it has similar size, gravity, and composition to Earth. This planet is the closest planet to Earth and a planet of similar size. At the same time, it is different from Earth in many ways. Of the four terrestrial planets, Venus has the densest atmosphere. This atmosphere consists of 96% carbon monoxide. Atmospheric pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth. The hottest planet in the Solar System, Venus has a surface temperature of 735K (462°C; 863°F). No rocks or terranes formed here because the carbon cycle did not take place; Besides, there are no organic organisms in the biosphere to absorb organic matter. The surface beneath is invisible to light due to the reflection of sulfuric acid clouds in Venus' atmosphere. There may have been oceans on Mercury in the past;[16][17] but these may have evaporated due to the temperatures of the Pingudil effect.[18] Water vapor may be separated by photosynthesis; Free hydrogen may have been blown into interplanetary space by the solar wind due to the absence of magnetic fields on the planet.[19] Silver's terrain is a dry desert, refreshed by occasional volcanic eruptions. Physical Properties It is a rocky planet like Earth. This planet is also called Earth's sister because its mass and half-length are almost the same as Earth's. Half of it has a length of 12092 km. Geography About 80 percent of Silver's surface is flat. It consists of 10 percent smooth Lopate plains and 70 percent smooth, volcanic plains. It has one continent at the North Pole and one just south of Venus' equator. The northern continent, about the same size as Australia, is named after the Babylonian goddess of love, Isudar. Maxwell Montus, Silver's highest mountain. Its peak has an average surface elevation of 11 km. is far away. The southern continent, equal in area to the two South American continents, is named after Aphrodite Terra, the Greek goddess of love. Magnetic Field and the Core The Venera 4 spacecraft launched in 1967 found that the magnetic field on Venus is much weaker than that on Earth. This magnetic field is also induced by the interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind;[20][21] silver lacks the internal magnetism typically found in planetary cores. Silver's small induced magnetosphere provides no shielding to the atmosphere from cosmic rays. These rays can cause lightning to occur between clouds.[22] Although similar in size to Earth, silver has a surprising lack of a magnetic field. There are three prerequisites for an internal alternator to operate: a conducting fluid, self-circulation, and power. The nucleus of silver is considered to be electrically conductive; Although silver's cycle is very slow, laboratory experiments have estimated this speed to be fast enough to produce an electrocatalyst.[23][24] Thus, it is believed that there is no evidence for the absence of electromagnetism in silver.[25] In the Earth's core, westerlies occur because the temperature of the water in the outer layers of the core is much higher than the temperature in the inner layers. Any surface event in Silver may have closed the plate crust structure and caused less convection in the nucleus. This may have caused the surface temperature to rise and prevented the heat from spreading from the interior. Due to these reasons, the geoelectric generator may not work. Alternatively, the crust may be heated by the heat of the nucleus.[25] Alternatively, it has been proposed that silver either lacks a solidification nucleus or that the nucleus has not cooled.[26] Because of this, the entire body of water is likely to be at the same temperature. An alternative view is also possible that the entire nucleus of silver has become solid. The condition of the embryo depends on the concentration of sulfur in the embryo; But the density of sulfur is not known till now.[25] Because the magnetic field on Venus is negligible, the solar wind interacts directly with its outer atmosphere. Here neutral molecules are separated by ultraviolet rays to form hydrogen and oxygen ions. The solar wind provides the necessary energy for these ions to escape from the gravitational field of silver. This corrosion results in the loss of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions in low mass; Higher mass molecules such as carbon dioxide are retained. Such solar wind action may have lost any water that may have been present on Venus during its first billion years. In addition, this process caused the ratio of low-mass hydrogen to high-mass deuterium in the upper atmosphere to be 150 times lower than in the inner atmosphere.[27] Appearance When viewed from Earth, Venus is brighter than any other star (except the Sun). Venus is brightest when it is near the Earth, apparent magnitude is -4.9, and is seen in the crescent phase. As the Sun retrogrades, its brightness fades to -3. The planet is also visibly bright at midday and easily visible when the Sun is low in the sky. Its orbit is between the orbit of the Sun and the orbit of the Earth, so when viewed from Earth, it appears to go as high as 47 degrees from the Sun's equator. Possibility of Human Colonization The surface environment of Venus is not currently habitable to humans. But the ring zone more than fifty kilometers from the surface of Venus has got nitrogen and oxygen, the basic gases suitable for human life. So it is possible that the monitor will create floating cities in the sky of Venus. It is possible to create floating cities (like the floating spaceship on the right) that are light and air-weighted, and build permanent settlements on them. But there are huge engineering and technical challenges and the density of sulfuric acid at these altitudes are obstacles. During transits of the Sun Main article - Transits of Venus An eclipse of Venus or transit of Venus refers to the passage of Venus in the Solar System as it orbits the Sun. This means that Venus is passing between the Sun and the Earth. During this transit, Venus is visible as a small dark spot in the solar circle. The duration of this transit is usually expressed in hours. This transit is similar to a solar eclipse caused by the Moon. Because of Venus's great distance from Earth (nearly 100 times the distance between Earth and the Moon), even though the diameter of Venus is 3 times that of the Moon, during transits, Venus appears very small and moves very slowly.

"A snake is a reptile, an invertebrate with a long body and a small head. Although they are legless, they cannot move fast by pushing the ground with their bodies. Some snakes can also swim well in water. There are more than 2,700 species of snakes, less than one percent of which are venomous (< 1%). Venomous snakes like cobra and cobra in India. These venomous snakes bite the enemy animals and prey with their teeth to save themselves and for food, and in the bite, the poison comes out of the sac behind the snake's teeth and injects it into the body of the bitten animal. A bitten animal will die soon. There are 230 species of snakes in India. About 50 of these species are poisonous. The venom of some venomous snakes attacks the nervous system. Cobras, coral snakes and snakes belong to this species. The venom of some other snakes attack and destroy blood vessels and blood cells and stop blood clotting. The glass snake belongs to this species. There are approximately 216 species of snakes in Sri Lanka. Body shape skin and color snake male female snake Snake skin shirt Snake skin shirt A snake's skin is covered with scales. They shed their skin once in a while. Because of the regenerative nature of snakes, they are used as symbols in the field of medicine. Hence the Greek symbol of Asclepius (Rod of Asclepius). This symbol indicates healing through medicines. As the snake's jaw vibrates subtly, these stapes also vibrate. Its brain 'hears' this shock. A snake has no ear lobes. Bony Act The skeleton of most snakes is the skull, vertebrae, and ribs. A snake's vertebral column consists of 200 to 400 (or more) vertebrae. Internal Organs The left lung of snakes is very small and in some is absent. So in snakes only one of the lungs works. Diet All snakes are omnivores. They feed on small animals. They feed on small reptiles, mice, birds, their eggs, and insects. ""The king cobra only eats snakes. Some snakes kill their prey with their venomous bite. Some snakes encircle and choke their prey. Some snakes swallow their prey whole alive. Lifelong reproduction snakes do by laying eggs. But some snakes give birth. U.M. Virians, green snake. In earthworms, the egg grows in the stomach and hatches. Snakes do not provide much protection to the eggs. Chill snakes incubate eggs. Renal snakes make nests of leaves on the ground and lay their eggs in them. Among snakes, only the blind (or worm) snake is fertilized without a male. Only the female species has been found. இனவகைகள் A phylogenetic overview of the extant groups Modern snakes Scolecopedia Leptoryphilopaedia Anomalypedia RhyphilopaediaAlythinopedia Aniliuscoralithinopedia Juropelrida Cylindrophils Anomocilus JuropelrinaMacrostomata Pythonidae Pythonine Xenopeltis Loxocemus Caenophidia Colubridae Acrochordidae Atractaspididae Elapidae Sea snake ViperidaeBoidae of Erycine Boinas calabaria Ungaliophiinae Tropidophiinae Emergists distinguish segments 11 and 15 among the more than 2,700 species of snakes. python Buttermilk go Non-poisonous snakes: Rattlesnake green snake Komperi Mokan North American Carter Snake Anaconda is the longest aquatic snake in the world (9 m). Deadly snakes Certain types of snakes have the ability to generate extreme venom. The snake species considered to be the deadliest snakes in the world are: The black mamba is a species of venomous snake native to Africa. This is the fastest reptile in the world. 20 km (12.5 miles) per hour is no small distance. A single bite can inject up to 100 milligrams of pus, and about 10 milligrams can kill people. The Indian cobra is a venomous snake found widely in the Indian subcontinent. They can grow up to about two meters in length. These are considered to be the deadliest snakes of the Indian subcontinent and are among the top four most dangerous venomous snakes. They account for the majority of snakebite deaths in India. The viper is one of the top four most dangerous venomous snakes. Although small in size, it is a blood venom that destroys the lymph nodes; Vigorous; Can attack immediately if disturbed; Curlworms are also responsible for most of the deaths. The glass viper is one of the four snakes known as the Big Four. The venom of the glass viper is a blood thinner. So doctors check blood clotting time and bleeding time every hour. Rasa Nagam is a species of snake that lives in Southeast Asia. It is the longest venomous snake in the world. Can grow up to about 6.7 meters (22 ft).[1] These types of snakes usually live in dense forests and often feed on other snakes. Its venom is not strong enough to kill a human in a single bite. Its bite has a mortality rate of up to 75%. The green viper is a venomous snake of the genus Virian found in Sri Lanka. So far no minors have been detected. Male snakes can grow up to 70 cm long and female up to 130 cm. Widely found everywhere in Sri Lanka. Found at altitudes up to 1800 meters from ground level. In human civilizations snakes are found in all countries like Persia, India, Sri Lanka, China, Sappan, Burma, Sava, Arabia, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Peru, America etc. In some countries the snake is considered a good deity and in others a bad deity.[2] If proverbs are snakes, the army will tremble A snake's foot is a snake Even if you pour milk to a snake, it will spit out dung ""Does breastfeeding change a snake's personality?"" ""Death to the snake in the snake, death to the thief in the field"" ""Snake shall not die and rod shall not be eaten."" ""If you go to a place where a snake eats, you must have the middle part!"" ""If you go to the village where the snake ate, you will believe that the middle continent is the continent."" ""A snake cannot be beaten, a snake cannot be jumped."" ""Snake bite? Fear bite?"" ""A Bombay that is born in too little time will be destroyed."" ""Ten minutes for a snake bite, half a minute for a snake bite.""[3] Snake in Mythology Snakes play an important role in Hindu mythology. Adiseshan is the dragon that is the bed of Vishnu, the guardian god of Hindus. Lord Shiva, the god of destruction, is also considered to be the brother of Vasuki snake which adorns his neck. Tirupati temple is also called Seshachalam because it has seven peaks which represent the seven heads of Adiseshan. A poisonous snake called Kalyan used to live in the river Yamuna, where Lord Vishnu takes the incarnation of Krishna. The water of that river became strange because of the river. Because of this no one goes to the river Yamuna. All the nearby grass, garlic, plants, vines and trees withered due to the poison of Abamba. Legend has it that Lord Krishna went to the Yamuna river and destroyed Appam. The gods and demons prayed that the Vasuki snake, which is an ornament around Shiva's neck, should be the last drink of milk. They said that the elixir would wash away the area. So the demons stood on one side of the serpent and the devas on the other side of the serpent, pulling the Mantra Hill as the liquor and the Vasuki as the rope to hold the ocean of milk. After waiting for a long time, the snake could not bear the pain and spat out the poison. The gods and demons prayed to Lord Shiva to save the people and themselves from that eternal poison. Lord Shiva drank Alakala poison and got the name ""Neelakandan"".[4] External links See also Snakebite Citations are external links Category:Reptiles * ",How many species of snakes are there in the world?,"2,700",230
"Silambam is a baton Tamil martial art and heroic sport of Tamils. In the case, this game is also known as kambu dal. It is a comprehensive martial art that consists of many elements such as stick handling, footwork, and self-defense through body movements. Chimbaltam is based on blocking the opponent's jab and touching the opponent's body with the jab (touch point). It takes at least six months to learn the alphabet. For this purpose, there are many dance clubs in Tamil Nadu. At least two people are required to dance the Silambatam. Only well-trained players play in Silambatu competitions, nowadays both men and women are learning and playing Silambatta. In festivals, temple ceremonies, and processions, chanting is a regular feature. This art is widely practiced in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanyakumari districts.[1] General health and medical benefits Coach or regular exercise with health benefits to improve muscle quickness and flexibility, hand-eye coordination, foot-eye coordination, body balance, muscle power, speed, muscle strength, circulatory block endurance, such as chimpanzee and chimpanzee (punch row). , muscle strength.[2] It is said that history has developed into the art of silambam, a method used by people to protect themselves from animals like lions and tigers. They used this art to defend themselves from animals using small weapons that they always had in their hands like kambu (stick), small knife and axe. When the Tamils ​​started fighting with weapons, the first weapon they took was the gun called kambu. This later developed into the art of cymbals. In primitive times, humans used various weapons like spears, knives, hilts, swords, and swords to fight. Among them, the most ancient weapon is the 'Silambu' called Kambu. In earlier times this art was used by the Satriyas. At present it is taught in a few schools and by private institutions. It also features as a heroic sport in sports competitions. The ancient Silambach Savadu and foot sequences mentioned in the Silambach Suwadis, after the end of the rule of Tamilnadu Movendras and Tamil Nadu's subjugation to foreigners, its names and dance patterns changed slightly. Vadakan kalari, deckan kalari, suvadu adi patam, karnataka suvadu, sramanam, sailath, thanjavur kuthu saru, nedungambu are still performed in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Studies Excavational evidence of sylamba art is very ancient. In the excavations of Adicha Nallur, which dates back to 2000 BC, 32 types of Cilamba weapons have been found. These are kept in the Chennai Museum. A four-foot-long reed used by Egyptian warriors is housed in a museum in Britain. Since the way they used that kambin resembled the cymbal, it is believed that cymbal art also spread from Tamil Nadu to Egypt as part of cultural exchange. Word Origin The name Silambam is derived from the word Silambam. Chilambu means sounding. The name Cilambam is said to have been derived from the general sounds produced by the cymbals. The word ""silambam"" was born from the verb ""silambal"". The mountain has another name as 'Silambam' because many sounds like the sound of falling waterfalls, the chirping of birds, the sound of leaves of trees moving in the wind, the noise of animals are resounding in the mountain areas. Therefore, Murugan, the god of the mountain land (Kurinji), also has the name 'Silambam'. The Tamil martial art got its name 'Silambam' due to the sound of the spinning of the rice and the sound of the weapons clashing together. The name 'Silambaram' is also used among the hill tribes west of Kadayanallur in Nellai district.[3] Literary References The cymbal is considered to be about 5000 years old. Sage Agathiya, who lived 2500 years ago, mentions Silamba as one of the 64 arts. There are references in the Tamil literature about the Cilambam, especially in the Cilappathikaram, that the drum, knife etc. for playing the Cilambam are sold in a shop and foreigners buy them with great interest. In Thirukkural, wheat is referred to as 'Gole' and in Kalingatupparani, 'Veesu Thandaii Kurmalu Okume', and also as 'Dandu'. In Thiruvilayat Purana, there are references to the game of sylamba. AD In the 15th century book ""Badhartha Guna Chintamani"" it is said that playing the sylambam will cure vada, pithama and kapam. Apart from these there are also olaichavadis like Kambu Sutra, Krunthadi sylambam and Natasari. reported to have studied arts.[3] In one of the folk songs, Kattabomman story, Veerapandiya Kattabomman used the sylamba to repel the British. ""Dice will be thrown over the top Tadikambale said I will kill; A series of cymbals ""There is Bharata Vallai"" It can be known from the Kummi song.[3][4] Elements of Silambam: Meipham, Bodybuilding, Breathing, Kuthuvara, Platevara, Udavara, Pitavara, Silambatam, Varma etc. are the main components of Silambala. If one wants to learn cymbals, one can start with the basics and learn these gradually to reach the various components of cymbals. Meippadam Meippadam is the first exercise in the art of silamba. Meippadam is the practice of physical fitness through rational exercises aimed at increasing physical strength. Bodybuilding is a discipline that is taught to build significant strength and flexibility in the body. This is secondary training. Breathing Breathing is the third exercise. Breathing is taught in order to be able to do more sophisticated exercises.. One learns meditation, bodybuilding and breathing. It paves the way for him to study extra subjects of his interest. Punctuation Punctuation is the main component of punctuation. As the name suggests, a punch line is a series of punches with the hands. As a finesse of punching, it is essential to learn how to gracefully change standing positions. Almost sixty four different postures are learned from tiger, elephant, snake, eagle and monkey. A punch line is a jab at an opponent while quickly changing positions depending on the opponent's position and displacement. Taekwondo One can learn taekwondo at the same time as he learns punching. The punchline is to reposition and knock out punches as the opponent throws them at you. Maneuvering Maneuvering means how to effectively bring the enemy into one's grasp and repel the attack when the enemy comes to attack him. This branch of mythology is derived from elephants. Almost two hundred different types of grips have been identified when elephants grip each other and all of them are included in this exercise. Footsteps is the act of using anything and skillfully changing one's feet according to the situation and arranging a blow on the opponent. This element of chimpanzee was learned from monkeys. A person who has learned in the lower order can next learn and master the sub-division of the art of chilambu called chilambhatam.[5] Cymbal track, Southern track, Northern track, Gold track, Coconut track, Othim track, Horse track, Blackboard track, Triangle track, Circle track, Micha track, Sarsai track, Thief game, Chakra kindi, Clavi line, Chitra Silamba, Kadamba line, There are order systems like Karunadaka order. Silambathadi Silambam is made from wood such as kambu or thadi for playing, bamboo and rattan. Of these, short grain rye is highly malleable. The staff for the cymbal should be as high as a person's forehead from the ground. Types of Cymbals There are many types of Cymbals. They are Dudukandam Kuravanji memory Decorative cymbal Porch cymbal Panayeri Mallu Nagatali, cobra, Kallankambu will be. Cymbal Round Patterns There are more than 72 types of round patterns in Cymbalta. Some of the rounding methods are spiral knife, torch, undercut, tangent, pichuap grip, caudal shield, veelkambu, spiral, whorl, front cut, back cut, intercept, upper part, malar, back cut, front cut. Swinging with a single cymbal held in both hands, Dancing with two cymbals in both hands It has both methods. Weapon categories in Silamba are Othim Suvadu, Division Suvadu, Retu Veechi, Locke Veecha, Madu Vishka, Uttela, Nedungambadi, Kopata, Sword Vee, Pechua, Surulpatta, Lesam, Sentayutham, Valari, Idikatti, Katari, Kandakodari, Veecharival, Vetarival, Kaltuni etc. There are They were skilled in throwing the mute coils, throwing reeds, and throwing chinnamarud. Karate and Chimpanzee The practice of ""kata"" in the martial sport of karate and the katambara of the chimpanzee are similar in function. Silambap Competition Silambatam, a martial art and martial art of Tamils, was performed only in festivals in medieval times. Now this art has become a heroic sport and has grown to the level of participating in competitions [6]. The cymbal is played solo or in pairs or in groups. A solo show is called 'Tanichuthu'. Silambam is also played as a competitive game between two players. It is a martial art. Cilambam Art Training In India, Cilambam is taught in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, as well as in countries like Sri Lanka, Malaysia, France and Canada. The Tamil Nadu government has recognized Silamba as a school sport. Silambam is conducted as a degree program at Venkadampatty Community College with the approval of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University. The National Jurisprudence Research Center of Palayamgottai Thuyasaveriyar Autonomous College has published a book titled ""Silamba History and Subordinations"" of Tenpandi Tamil. Benefits Yoga is a great form of exercise. Every nerve, nerve, and muscle in the body is activated while spinning. Holding the pole in its hands, it can create a fence-like structure around its body as it twists and turns around itself. Anyone who tries to attack with other weapons inside such a fence made of only one cell can be prevented by the rotating pole. Cymbal training helps to achieve body strength, energy, speed and flexibility. World record On January 21, 2019, the United Nations discussed for the first time in the history of the symbol of the world and designated the symbol Asia for the position of the Asian continent. China and India have border issues in historical records. Chinese government representative Silambam has requested Asia to resolve border issues. It was held at the United Nations headquarters in New York City, USA.[7] Subsidiaries J. David Daniel Raj, Silambam - History and History, Karaikudi Alagappar College Publication, 1971 Sun.

". In physics, energy (energy, in Greek ἐνέργεια – energeia, ""action, ἐνεργός – energos, ""actively acting"") [1]) is simply defined as the quantity capable of doing work. That is, the energy of a substance is considered to indicate the amount of work it can do. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but one type of energy can be converted into another. The unit of energy in the International System of Units is the joule. The work done to move an object a distance of 1 meter is the joule. Kinetic energy of an object in motion, gravitational force, potential energy stored in an object in the form of electric or magnetic forces, elastic energy stored in the stretching of solids, chemical energy released when fuel burns, radiant energy stored in light, and thermal energy due to the temperature of an object are all common forms of energy. Mass and energy are closely related. Because of the mass–energy equation, which shows how the mass of an object is related to its energy, any object at rest has a constant energy equal to its constant mass. Additionally, if some form of energy is added to the object, the total mass of the object will increase as much as the energy. For example, after heating a substance, we can measure and sense the increase in mass as well as the increase in energy. The sensitivity of this increase is adequate. Just as humans survive on the energy they get from food, other organisms also need energy to survive. The energy that humans need comes from energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy. Earth's climate and environmental processes are powered by radiant energy from the Sun and the Earth's geothermal energy. What is energy? The ability to do work is called energy. ஆற்றலின் வடிவங்கள் ஒரு முறைமையின் மொத்த ஆற்றல் பல்வேறு வழிகளில் பிரிக்கப்பட்டு வகைப்படுத்தப்படுறது. எடுத்துக்காட்டாக விசையியலிருந்து மரபார்ந்த விசையியல் வேறுபடுத்தப்படுகிறது. விண்வெளியின் ஊடாக நகரும் பொருள் மற்றும் அதன் நிலையாற்றல் ஆகியனவற்றைக் கொண்டு ஒரு பொருளின் இயக்க ஆற்றல் தீர்மானிக்கப்படுகிறது. விண்வெளிக்குள் அப்பொருளின் இருப்பிடம் இங்கு முக்கியத்துவம் பெறுகிறது. புவியீர்ப்பு சக்தி, வெப்ப ஆற்றல், பல வகையான அணுக்கரு ஆற்றல், மின் ஆற்றல் மற்றும் காந்த ஆற்றல் போன்ற ஆற்றல்களுக்கிடையிலான வேறுபாடுகளை விளக்கவும் இத்துறை மிகுந்த பயனளிக்கிறது. இந்த வகைப்பாடுகளில் ஒன்றுடன் ஒன்று; உதாரணமாக, வெப்ப ஆற்றல் வழக்கமாக இயக்கவியல் மற்றும் பகுதியளவு சக்திவாய்ந்த பகுதியை கொண்டுள்ளது. இந்த வகைப்பாடுகளில் பல ஒன்றுடன் ஒன்று கலந்திருப்பதாகக் தோன்றுகின்றன. உதாரணமாக, வெப்ப ஆற்றல் வழக்கமாக பகுதியளவு இயக்கவியலும் பகுதியளவு நிலையாற்றலையும் கொண்டுள்ளது. சில வகையான ஆற்றல்கள் நிலையாற்றல் மற்றும் இயக்க ஆற்றல் ஆகிய இரண்டின் மாறுபட்ட கலவையாகும். இயந்திர ஆற்றலை இதற்கு ஒர் உதாரணமாகக் கூறலாம். இது நிலையாற்றல் மற்றும் இயக்க ஆற்றல் ஆகியவற்றின் கலவையாகும். இந்த பட்டியல் நிறைவுபெற வேண்டியதற்கான அவசியம் இல்லை. எப்போதெல்லாம் விஞ்ஞானிகள் ஆற்றல் பாதுகாப்பு விதியை மீறுவதாக கண்டறிகிறார்களோ அப்போதெல்லாம் புதிய ஆற்றல் வடிவங்கள் சேர்க்கப்பட்டு முரண்பாட்டினை வெளிப்படுத்துகின்றன. வெப்பம் மற்றும் வேலை என்பவை சிறப்பு வகை ஆற்றல்களாகும், அவை ஆற்றலின் பண்புகள் அல்ல, மாறாக ஆற்றல் மாற்றச் செயல்முறைகளின் பண்புகளாகக் கருதப்படுகின்றன. ஒரு பொருளில் எவ்வளவு வெப்பம் அல்லது வேலை உள்ளது என்பதை பொதுவாக அளவிட முடியாது, ஆனால் ஒரு குறிப்பிட்ட செயல்முறை நிகழ்வின் போது அப்பொருட்களில் ஏற்படும் ஆற்றல் மாற்றத்தை அளவிட முடியும். நாம் நோக்கும் திசையிலிருந்து வெப்பம் அல்லது வேலையின் அளவு நேர்மறை அல்லது எதிர்மறை அளவுகளாக அளவிடலாம். நிலையாற்றல்கள் பொதுவாக நேர்மறை அல்லது எதிர்மறை அளவுகளாக கணக்கிடப்படுகின்றன. ஒரு குறிப்பிட்ட அடிப்படை நிலையில் உள்ள ஆற்றலைக் காட்டிலும் குறைவாகவோ அல்லது கூடுதலாகவோ உள்ள அளவை அடிப்படையாகக் கொண்டு இக்கணக்கீடு அமைகிறது. அல்லது இடைவினைபுரியும் இரண்டு பொருட்கள் வெகுதொலைவில் இருப்பதைப்போன்ற அமைப்பினைக் கொண்டுள்ளது. கதிர்வீச்சு ஆற்றல் மற்றும் ஒலி ஆற்றல் போன்ற அலை ஆற்றல்கள், இயக்க ஆற்றல், ஓய்வுநிலை ஆற்றல் முதலானவை ஒவ்வொன்றும் பூச்சியத்திற்குச் சமமாக அல்லது அதிகமாக இருக்கும். ஏனெனில் இவை அடிப்படை நிலை அளவாக பூச்சியத்தை ஒப்பிட்டு முறையே அலையற்ற, இயக்கமற்ற, சடத்துவமற்ற நிலையில் கணக்கிடப்படுகின்றன. வரலாறு ஆற்றல் என்ற பொருள் கொண்ட energy என்ற சொல் பண்டைய கிரேக்க மொழியில் ἐνέργεια, செயல்பாடு என்ற பொருள் கொண்ட சொல்லில் இருந்து வந்துள்ளது [2]. இச்சொல்லின் பயன்பாடு கி.மு. 4 ஆம் நூற்றாண்டில் அரிசுடாட்டிலின் படைப்பில் முதல் முறையாக தோன்றியிருப்பதாக அறியப்படுகிறது. நவீன வரையறைக்கு முரணாக ஆற்றல் என்பது மகிழ்ச்சி, ஆனந்தம் போன்ற பண்பு சார்ந்த ஒரு தத்துவ கருத்தாக அன்று கருதப்பட்டது. 17 ஆம் நூற்றாண்டின் பிற்பகுதியில், கோட்ஃபிரைட் லீப்னிசு இலத்தீன் மொழியில் vis viva என்ற கருத்தை முன்மொழிந்தார். ஒரு பொருளின் நிறையை அதன் திசைவேகத்தின் வர்கத்தால் பெருக்கினால் கிடைக்கும் அளவே ஆற்றல் என்று அவர் கூறினார். இம்முழு ஆற்றலும் காப்புற்ற அளவு என்றும் அவர் நம்பினார். உராய்வுடன் ஆற்றலை ஒப்பிட்ட, லீப்னிசு, பரு பொருள்களின் பகுதிகளான உட்கூறுகளின் சீரற்ற இயக்கத்தால் வெப்ப ஆற்றல் தோன்றுகிறது என்று கருதினார். இக்கோட்பாடு பொதுவாக ஒரு நூற்றாண்டுக்கு மேல்வரையிலும் ஏற்றுக்கொள்ளப்பட்டது. தற்கால இதனையொத்த இயக்க ஆற்றல் இரண்டு காரணிகளால் வேறுபடுகிறது. In 1807, Thomas Eng replaced the term vis viva with its modern meaning [3]. In 1829, Kusudave-Cassupard used the Coriolis kinetic energy with its modern meaning. William Rankin coined and used the term potential energy in 1853. The law of non-destruction of energy was proposed in the early 19th century. This is applicable to any isolated system. The debate over whether heat is a physically relevant substance continued for some years. Considered a quantity such as the calorie or momentum. The connection between mechanical work and heat generation was discovered in 1845 by Yemsu Prasukhot Yule. Such developments led to the theory of the indestructibility of energy. Mostly William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) formalized the field of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics facilitated the rapid development of chemical processes by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walter Nernschut. Also, the department helped introduce Claudius' theory of entropy formation and Joseph Stephen's laws of radiative energy. Noether's quantifiable dependence theorem states that energy is invariant over time[4]. Hence since 1918 the law of non-destruction of energy has been understood by theorists as a quantum measure of direct motion proportional to time. Units of Energy In 1843 Yemsu Presukot Yule discovered the mechanical equilibrium of heat through a series of experiments. Many of the most famous used Yule's apparatus: a weight attached to a wire that rotates an insulated paddle submerged in water to prevent heat transfer. This device shows that the gravitational force lost by the weight is equal to the internal force exerted by the water due to the friction of the paddle. The unit of energy in the International System of Units is the joule. The planet got its name because of its discovery by Yemsu Presukhot Yule. A joule is equal to the energy expended to move a distance of one meter using one newton of force. However, apart from the International System of Units, various units such as erg, calorie, British thermal unit, kilowatt-hour, kilocalorie are used to measure heat energy. When using these scales a conversion factor is necessary to express them in international units. Watt is the unit of power rating in the International System of Units. (ie energy per unit time) which is one joule per second. So, one joule equals one watt-second and 3600 joules equals one watt-hour. The unit of energy in the centimeter-gram-second system is the erg. In the US imperial system of measurement, this is called a foot-pound. Apart from these, units like electron volt, calorie food, kilocalorie are used in certain areas of science and commerce. Scientific Uses Energy is a conceptual and mathematical utility in classical physics. Because it is a protected quantity. Many formulas have been developed in mechanics using energy as a key tool. Work is a form of energy that bridges time and distance. W = ∫ C F ⋅ d s {\displaystyle W=\int_{C}\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}} Work (W) is the linear summation equal to the integration of the force F along the path C. Work and energy are related to a frame. For example, suppose a ball is hit by a bat. The bat doesn't do any work on the ball. But sufficient work is done on the ball by the bowler. The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian. This energy got its name because it was discovered by William Rowan Hamilton. Classical Equations of Motion The classical equations of motion can be written in Hamiltonian terms even for very complex or compact systems. These classical equations have significant direct analogies with non-relativistic quantum mechanics [5]. Another energy-related theory is the Ilagrangian theory discovered by Joseph-Louis Ilagrangian. In this method also the basics of Hamilton's theory are followed. In both these theories the equations of motion are derived or derived. Although this theory was found to challenge classical mechanics, it is very useful for modern physics. Usually obtained by subtracting the static energy from the kinetic energy is called the Ilograngian. Ilacrangean theory is considered more convenient for mathematics than Hamiltonian theory. Noidhar's theorem, developed in 1918, states that the operation of any physical system with a classifiable symmetry has an associated conservation law. Noida's theorem became a fundamental tool for modern theoretical physics and mathematical differentiation.

"Leonardo da Vinci or Illianardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519) was a renowned Italian Renaissance architect, inventor, engineer, sculptor, and painter. Considered a versatile genius. He is especially widely known for his excellent paintings. Paintings like ""The Last Supper"" and ""Mona Lisa"" are world famous. He is also known for many discoveries that were made much earlier than the time of Uri EAHCDWQN. However, none of these were published during his time. He also played a major role in the development of the fields of anatomy, astronomy and civil engineering. He had an insatiable curiosity and an intense imagination [1]. He is one of the greatest painters the world has ever lived and is versatile.[2] Leonardo da Vinci is primarily known as a painter. His painting ""Mona Lisa"" is considered to be the most famous painting in the world.[3] Leonardo da Vinci is highly regarded for his technological genius. He shared his intellectual thoughts in many fields including geology and made many innovations unimaginable in his time.[4] He made innovations in the fields of anatomy, architecture, optics and hydrodynamics. However, he did not have a direct influence on these fields as he did not publish them in his contemporaries.[5] Life Youth His life is described in Giorgio Vasari's biography, Vitae. Illianardo was born in Vinci, Italy. His father, Ser Piero da Vinci, was a well-to-do landowner or artisan; Mother Katarina was a peasant woman. There is also a theory that Catherine was a Middle Eastern slave owned by Piero, but there is no strong evidence for this. He grew up in Florence with his father. He was a vegetarian all his life. He apprenticed under a painter in Florence and later became a painter in his own right. His time was before the introduction of modern nomenclature in Europe. Thus his full name is ""Illianardo di Ser Piero da Vinci"". It reads ""Illianardo son of Piero of Vinci"". He signed his works as ""Illianardo"" or ""I am Illianardo"" (Io, Leonardo). Thus his works are generally referred to as ""Eleonortos"" rather than ""Da Vincis"". It is also believed that since he was an illegitimate child, he may not have used his father's name. Leonardo's early years are largely the subject of historical speculation. Vasari, a 16th-century historian of Renaissance painters, wrote a note on Leonardo. A local resident came to Leonardo's father and asked him to paint a picture on a round board with his talented son. Accordingly, Leonardo drew a picture of snakes spewing fire on the blackboard. The terrifying painting was sold by Leonardo's father to a Florentine art dealer. The seller won it to the Duke of Milan. The note says that Leonardo's father, who made a good profit from this, bought another picture of an arrow piercing the heart and gave it to the peasant. Verrocchio's Studio, 1466-1476 In 1466, at the age of 14, Leonardo joined the most successful painter of the day, Andre the Sion, known as Verrocchio. Since Verrocchio's workshop was in the intellectual area of ​​Florence, Eleonorto gained knowledge of the arts. Famous painters such as Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, Lorenzo de' Gredi were also professionals or otherwise associated with the same workshop. Leonardo was introduced to a wide range of technical skills and had the opportunity to learn drawing, painting and sculpture as well as drawing, painting, sculpting, drawing, chemistry, metallurgy, metalwork, plaster casting, leatherwork, mechanics, carpentry, etc. Many of the inventions in Verrocchio's workshop were made by his employees. According to Vasari, Verrocchio and Leonardo painted the Baptism of Christ together. Eleonordo's depiction of the young angel carrying Jesus' robes surpassed even his master's, so Verrocchio put down his brush and stopped painting after that. This may be an overstatement. On closer inspection, the painting appears to be Leonardo's hand painting. By 1472, in the reign of Leonardo XX, a group of doctors and artists, Sen. Luke qualified as an expert in the group. However, Leonardo's father had set up a private studio for him, but he continued to work with Verrocchio due to his closeness. The oldest painting known to have been painted by Leonardo is a pen and ink painting of the Arno Valley. It is dated 5th August 1473. Career Period According to court records, he was prosecuted on certain charges in 1476 and later acquitted. From 1476 to 1481 he is thought to have had his own workshop in Florence, but from 1476 to 1478 there is no record of him. In 1478, he was commissioned to paint The Adoration of the Magi at St Barnard's Cathedral. From 1482 to 1499 he worked for Ludovico Sporza, the ""Duke"" of Milan, and ran a workshop with several apprentices. In 1495, seventy tons of bronze, earmarked for Illianardo's equestrian statue, ""Gran Cavallo,"" were used to cast arms to defend Milan from an attack by the French forces under Charles VIII. When France returned in 1498 under Louis XIII, Milan fell unopposed. Sporza resigned. Illianardo stayed in Milan until one day he saw a full-size clay model for his ""Gran Cavallo"" being used by French archers for target practice. He then traveled to Mantua with Satelli and his friend Luca Pacchioli and reached Venice two months later. He returned to Florence in April 1500. He was employed as a military architect and engineer by Cesare Borgia (son of Pope Alexander VI, also known as ""Ducca Valentino"") in Florence. Again in 1506, after Francier was chased by Swiss mercenaries, Maximilian returned to Milan, where he fell into the hands of the Sporza. There he met Francisco Melchi, who became his companion until his death and later his successor. Later from 1513 to 1516 he lived in Rome. At that time, painters like Raphael Santi and Michelangelo were active there. However, he did not have much contact with them. In 1515, Francis I of France recaptured Milan. Leonardo was commissioned to make a mechanical lion for the King of France and Pope Leo X for the upcoming peace talks in Bologna. It was then that Leonardo must have met the king for the first time. In 1516, he entered the service of Francis. The manor house of Gloucester Luge, near the king's residence, was granted for his use, and a generous pension was provided. The king became his close friend. In 1519, Leonardo died in Cloux, France. As per his wishes 60 beggars followed his coffin. He was buried in the Saint-Hubert Chapel at Amboise Castle. Connections and Influences Florence - Leonardo's Artistic and Social Background Verrocchio's tutor Donatello died in 1466, when Leonardo entered into business with Verrocchio. Uccello was a very old man who painted paintings that helped develop landscape paintings. The painters Piero della Francesca, Fra Filippo Lippi and Luca della Robbia and the architect and writer Alberti were over sixty. The successful painters of the next generation included Leonardo's mentor Verrocchio, Antonio Pollaiuolo, and the sculptor Mino da Fiesole. Leonardo's youth was spent in Florence, which was decorated by these painters. Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino were contemporaries of Leonardo. They may have met Leonardo Verrocchio in his workplace and at the Medici Academy. As Botticelli was favored by the Medici family, his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were well-to-do who ran large workshops. Both of them worked very efficiently and satisfied their employers. Leonardo's first work was Adoration of the Magi. But this is not complete. Art Leonardo da Vinci is known for paintings such as The Last Supper, painted in 1498, and the Monolisa, painted in 1503-1506. Only 17 of his paintings survive today. No sculptures are known. He is believed to have done a small sculpture of a house in the Hunt Museum, Limerick, Ireland. One of the surviving paintings is in North America. Leonardo often planned large paintings. So these projects had to be halted without being completed. Years were spent making models and plans for a 7 meter (24 ft) tall bronze horse sculpture to be installed in Milan. However, the project was not completed due to the war with France. Due to personal initiative, a similar statue based on some of Da Vinci's designs was made in New York in 1999, delivered to Milan and installed there. In Florence, he was commissioned to do a public mural entitled The Battle of Ensign. On the opposite wall, his rival Michelangelo was painting. He left the city after painting several excellent early studies. The mural was not completed due to technical reasons. Science and engineering can be seen in his works of art, and his studies in science and engineering are more attractive. These flows are recorded as notes and images in about 13,000 pages of reference books. A left-handed writer, he used mirrored letters all his life. His approach to science is nocturnal. He tried to explain the phenomena by describing and expressing them in minute detail. He did not give priority to methods and theoretical explanations. Throughout his life, he planned to create an encyclopedia with detailed maps of everything. Due to his lack of formal education in Latin and mathematics, he was ignored by the scientists of his time. Anatomy and Physiotherapy He began studying the anatomy of the human body through his training under Andrea Verocchi. Verocchi was keen for his students to gain an in-depth knowledge of the subject.[6] As a painter, Da Vinci excelled in anatomy, drawing muscles, tendons, and connective tissue. A successful painter, Da Vinci was allowed to mutilate corpses at the Santa Maria Nuova Hospital in Florence. Later he was approved for this in Urom city and Milan hospitals. From 1510 to 1511 he studied with the physician Marcantonio della Thore. Illianardo drew 240 detailed diagrams and composed an anatomy textbook containing 13,000 words.[7] He has given these to his cousin Francisco Melzhi to publish. This work is considered to be extremely rare due to Da Vinci's unique style and breadth of knowledge. A small section of anatomy in his sketchbook was published in 1632.[9][8] These were visited by many anatomists and many painters, including Vasari, Cellini, and Albrecht Dürer, and many drawings were made from them while Melchi was organizing the subject matter.[8] His reputation for engineering and innovation led the King of France to carry him in his hand like a trophy during his lifetime, and the King protected him throughout his old age. Even after his death, the king was carrying him by his hand. His interest in his work never waned. People still flock to see his well-known works of art; T-shirts still bear his paintings; Writers continue to praise his intellect and interest in portraying his private life.[9] [[Giorgio Vasari, in his enlarged Lives of the Artists, 1568,[10] introduces Leonardo da Vinci with the following words: Many men and women naturally possess superior abilities; Only sometimes, in the state of surpassing nature, a lone person is born somewhere behind the others who are endowed with heaven-given beauty, knowledge, grace and talent. All his powers come from God rather than from manta. Everyone agrees that this is true of Leonardo da Vinci. His glory and majesty shine through in all that he does. He developed his intellectual skills in such a way that he found very simple solutions to all the problems he took.—Giorgio Vasari A newly described mineral called davinsite was named in his honor by the International Mineralogical Society in 2011.[11] Art market Illianardo's Salvator Mundi sold for $450.3 million at a New York Christie's auction on November 15, 2017, becoming the world's highest-selling artwork.[12] The previous highest price was Pablo's Les Femmes d'Alger, which sold for $179.4 million at the same New York, Christie auction in May 2015. William de Kooning's Transfiguration was sold privately by the David Geffen Foundation in September 2015 for $300 million. This is the highest price ever sold for an artwork.

"J.J. Sir Joseph John Thomson (December 18, 1856 - August 30, 1940), commonly known as Thomson (Joseph John Thomson), was an English physicist who discovered the electron, the fundamental element of the atom. He studied electricity, magnetism and isotopes. He is hailed as the 'Father of Modern Nuclear Physics'. Discoverer of the mass spectrum. He became a professor of physics and received the 'Adams Prize' for his research and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. His mother, Emma Swindell, and father, Joseph James Thomson, were from a Scottish family.[1] youth He was born in 1856 at 'Cheetham Hill' in Manchester, England. His parents belonged to a Scottish family. In 1870 he attended Owensboro College, Manchester, and then in 1876, Trinity College, Oxford. There he studied very well and won the 'Adamsu Paris' [2] . As a result, he was appointed as a member of the college till his last days. His father wanted him to become an engineer. But after the death of his father, his family was unable to pay the fees, so that wish was not fulfilled. Owensu College taught him the best professors and his scientific education was excellent. In 1883, he was appointed as a professor in the college itself. He was appointed Cavendish Laboratory Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Cambridge. Before him, Lord Raleigh was a professor in the work. From 1884 to 1918 he was appointed professor of economics at Cambridge and at the Royal Institution in London[3]. He also became a member of the Royal Society. In 1890 he married Rose Elizabeth. A son and a daughter were born to him. His son 'George Paget Thomson' became an outstanding professor of physics and later won the prize in 1937. Studies Thomson was the first to research the atom and published a treatise entitled ""Treatise on the motion of Vortex Rings"". It won him the Adamsu Prize in 1884. In 1886, he published a paper entitled 'Application of the Dynamics to Physics and Chemistry'. In 1892 he published the book 'Notes on Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism'. It was the third volume of James Clark Maxwell's book as an introduction to his book. Along with Prof. J.H.Poynting, he published a course in physics entitled 'Properties of Matter' in four volumes. Study of cathode rays Thomson was involved in the study of cathode rays with the help of a cathode ray tube. His first study was whether it was possible to isolate resistive particles from antielectron rays. With the help of an electrometer, he made several slits in the tube and examined it with the help of a magnetic field. He realized that it was impossible to separate the anti-electrons from these rays [4]. Secondly he investigated how these rays are affected by an electric field. He continued his research using the vacuum tube and luminescence. He thereby discovered that anti-electron rays are hit by an electric field [5]. Electron detection In the third study he sought to find the charge-mass ratio of the electron. He called anti-electron particles 'Corpuscles'. Later a scientist named Johnstone Stoney confirmed it as electronic [6]. From this came the fact that objects are electrically conductive. From this arose modern atomic theory and the explanation of physical effects associated with the atom. Hence he is hailed as the father of modern nuclear physics. In 1895 he published two books 'Elements of Mathematics' and 'Principles of Electricity and Magnetism'. They also published a fifth edition in 1921. In 1896 Thompson went to America. He delivered four lectures there based on his early studies. He announced his discovery of the electronic particle during an evening lecture at the Royal Society of London. He announced this on Friday, April 30, 1897. In 1903, he also published a book entitled ""Conduction of Electricity through Gases"". This book was later published in two editions (1928 and 1933) by his son George Thomson, entitled 'Thomson's Great Days at the Cavendish Laboratory'. He went back to America in 1904. He lectured at Yale University on materials and electricity. His ideas on the 'Structure of the Atom' were published. Isotopes and mass spectrometry Using the ideas of scientists such as Austen and Dempster to separate different types of atoms and molecules using electron beams, he explained a method that would help find many isotopes. Through his analysis of neon gas, he made it clear that certain elements are compounds of isotopes. Based on that, his students Asudan and Dempster created a mass spectrograph. In 1906 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his studies on the effects of passing electricity through gases in a discharge tube. He was involved in determining the number of electrons in atoms by measuring the amount of scattering of light, theria, beta and gamma rays. Similarly, he was also involved in researches on the nature of electro-particles. These studies helped his student Rutherford to continue his research. Books published The Structure of Light-1907 The Corpuscular Theory of Matter-1913 Positive Rays of Electricity-1913 The electron in Chemistry-1936 Recollection and Reflections (History)-1936 He wrote and published many books like specialties He was awarded the Order of Merit in 1908. In 1912, he became the President of the English Society. He was given a special membership of the Royal Society and then its president from 1916 to 1920. In 1918 he became Chancellor of Trinity College. He founded the Cavendish Research Institute there.

In 1935, he resigned as editor of the Justice newspaper after being appointed to the Government Revenue Department.[6] He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the Indian Department of the British Government. He was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 25 February 1937.[8][9] All India Non-Brahmin Movement Ramasamy Mudaliar had good friendly relations with Shaku Maharaj and the leaders of the Maharashtra Non-Brahmin Movement and other North Indian Non-Brahmin Movement leaders. Ramasamy Mudaliar helped coordinate leaders of non-Brahmin organizations in different parts of India and held conferences for them.[10] On 18 December 1922, he participated in the Brahminaralladore conference at Satara under the chairmanship of Rajaram II.[10] On December 26, 1924, he attended the All-India Non-Brahmin Conference at Belgaum and was praised by all. On February 8, 1925, he attended the Seventh Non-Brahmin Conference and spoke about the need for unity with non-Brahmins.[10][11] In 1925 Sir P. D. Mudaliar was the only bridge between Shaku Maharaj's Satya Shodak Samaj and the Justice Party after Thyagaraya Chetty's demise. On December 19, 1925, Panagal assisted the King in holding the All India Brahmin Allathor Conference at the Victoria Hall, Chennai. On December 26, 1925, he again held a second conference at Amaravati. It happened in two series. The first session was presided over by the Maharaja of Kolhapur and the second session by the King of Panagal. Mudaliyar spoke in the second series:- It is beyond the point where I have to explain the non-Brahmin movement. Its operations spread from Bombay to Chennai and from Vindhya Hills to Kanyakumari. The lightning speed and scope with which its principles spread across the country will illustrate the status of the movement. Mudaliar's speech was criticized by The Hindu, saying his desire to establish himself in other provinces had fueled his imagination to such an extent. Ramasamy Mudaliyar was appointed as a member of the Viceroy's Executive Committee in 1939 when World War II broke out in the War Cabinet.[12][13] In June 1942, K. C. Mouse. I (KCSI) degree awarded. In July 1942, he was one of two Indians appointed to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's war cabinet. They were given the same rights and privileges as the representatives of other areas under British rule.[12][13] Dr In 1945, Oxford University awarded him the title of ""Doctor of Civil Law"" (Doctor of Civil Law) in recognition of his services during the Second World War. [14] Mudaliyar attended the United Nations General Assembly Conference held in San Francisco from April 25 to June 26, 1945 as the President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) as India's representative. There he presided over a working committee meeting that discussed economic and social issues.[15] On 23 January 1946, he was elected the first President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council at Church House, London.[16][17] In February 1946, a council meeting chaired by Mudaliar passed a resolution that an international health conference should be held.[18] The International Health Conference was held on June 19, 1946. Mudaliyar started it. This is where the World Health Organization (WHO) came into being. The draft laws of the organization were discussed and accepted by representatives from 61 countries.[19] He served as the President of the Economic and Social Council for one year and then returned to India and was sworn in as the Chief Minister (Dewan) of Mysore.[20] Maharaja Jayachamaraja of Mysore advised Wadiyar not to join independent India.[21][22] Works References Citations Cite has empty unknown parameter: |coauthors= (help) Category:City Fathers of Chennai Category:Judiciary Leaders Category:1887 Births Category:1976 Deaths Category:Mysore Diwans ",Winston Churchill belonged to which country?,British,1338
"Animals are a large group of mostly multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia or Metazoa. Their body plan eventually stabilizes as they grow. Some go into a metamorphosis process later in life. Many animals are migratory. They can move spontaneously and freely. Many animals are also carnivorous. That means they have to eat other organisms to survive. Many known animal groups appear in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, about 542 million years ago. History The English word ""animal"" is derived from the Latin word animale. It is derived from the word anima which means vital breath or soul. In everyday colloquial usage, the term usually refers to non-human animals. The biological definition of the term Kingdom Animalia refers to all members including humans. Characteristics Animals have many characteristics that distinguish them from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular organisms[3] (see also Myxozoa). These separate them from bacteria and many other organisms. They are carnivorous.[4] Digestion usually takes place in a chamber. This separates them from plants and algae (although some algae have photosynthetic and nitrogen-fixing abilities).[5] They also differ from plants, algae, and fungi in lacking firm cell walls.[6] It can be said that all animals are migratory at certain life stages [7]. In many animals, the embryo progresses to a stage called an embryo. This is a characteristic unique to animals. Anatomy Animals have bodies that are divided into separate tissues. However, there are some notable exceptions, namely the sponges (class Porifera) and Plagozoa. The body includes muscles that contract and control movement, and nervous system tissue that transmits and processes signals. Usually a built-in digestion chamber is also located with one or two openings. Animals with this type of organization are called metazoans (multicellular organisms). or eumetazoans where the former is commonly used to refer to animals. Reproduction and Development Almost all animals engage in some form of sexual reproduction. They have a few specialized reproductive cells. Meiosis takes place in these to produce small motile spermatozoa or large meiosis eggs. These unite to form zygotes, which develop into new organisms. Many animals also have the ability to reproduce asexually. (By parthenogenesis) Fertile eggs are produced unfertilized, or in some cases by fragmentation. An ovum develops initially within a sterile sphere called the blastula. It undergoes reorganization and differentiation. In sponges, the globular larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new species of sponge. In many other groups, the nucleus undergoes a more complex rearrangement. It first folds inwards to form a gastrula, a digestive chamber, and a gastrula with two separate germ layers – an outer ectotherm (outer layer) and an inner endotherm (inner layer). These tissue layers then undergo differentiation to form tissues and organs. Source of food and energy Predation is a biological exchange event in which a predator (a carnivorous animal that hunts) eats its prey (the target organism). Predators may or may not kill their prey before eating it. But hunting always ends in the death of the prey. Another major category of consumption is detritivory. That means eating food that contains dead organic matter. Sometimes it becomes difficult to distinguish between the two eating habits. For example, parasitic organisms prey on and feed on an organism. They then lay their eggs on the decomposing body to feed their offspring. The selective pressures exerted by one on the other have led to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. This has led to various anti-predation adaptations. Many animals get their food indirectly from sunlight. Plants use this energy by converting sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) molecules, photosynthesis converts sunlight energy into chemical energy stored in glucose (C6H12O6) bonds and releases carbon dioxide (O2). These sugars serve as building blocks and allow the plant to grow. When animals eat these plants (or other animals that may have eaten the plants), the sugars made by the plant are used by the animal. They can be used directly for the animal to grow, or they can be broken down and release the collected sunlight energy to give the animal the power it needs to move. This process is called glycolysis. SOURCES AND FOSSIL RECORD Animals are generally thought to have evolved from a lepidopteran eukaryote. Their closest living relatives are thought to be the zoonoflagellates, flagellates with necks morphologically similar to the zoonocytes of some sponges. Molecular studies classify animals into a specialized group called opisthokonts. These include zoonoflagellates, fungi and some small parasitic unicellular organisms. The name derives from the fact that motile cells have flagellum, a posterior arrangement similar to that found in the mature sperm of many animals. Other eukaryotes tend to have anterior ligaments. The first fossils that may represent animals appear in the pre-Cambrian period. These are fossils dating back to about 610 million years ago. However, these are difficult to correlate with later burials. Some modern animal groups may belong to separate groups, even if the prediction is correct; There is also the possibility that they are not animals at all. Apart from them, most of the known animal groups originate from about the same period in the Cambrian period, about 542 million years ago. Whether this event, known as the Cambrian explosion, represented a rapid divergence between different groups or a change in conditions that made fossilization possible is still debated. Yet paleontologists and geologists who study primitive life forms through fossils suggest that animals may have existed much earlier than previously thought, possibly as much as 1 billion years earlier. Fossil traces such as tracks and pits found in the Thonian period indicate that triploplastic worms such as medozoans may have been nearly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms.[8][9][10] Animal Blocks Porifera It has long been thought that the sponges (Porifera) first diverged from other animals. As mentioned above, they lack the complex anatomy found in many other animal blocks. Their cells are undifferentiated. But in many cases it is not organized into separate tissues. Seaweeds are adherent. They generally feed by drawing water through pores. However, a 2008 study of 150 genomes in 21 species[11] revealed that hair jellies may be the basic pathway of animals, at least 21 of them. Both have distinct tissues, but are not organized into organs. There are only two major germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm. Only cells are scattered between them. As such, these animals are sometimes called diploblastic animals. Smaller placozoans are similar. But they don't have a permanent digestive chamber. The rest of the animals form a monophyletic group called Philateria. For the most part, they are bilaterally symmetrical. They often have a distinctive head with feeding and sensory organs. The body is threefold. All three microbial layers are well-developed. Tissues make up well-sorted organs. The digestive chamber has two openings. There is also a mouth and an anus, another internal body cavity called the coelom or pseudocoelom. However, there are exceptions to each of these characteristics – for example, mature echinoderms are radially ipsilateral. Some parasitic worms have very simplified body structures. Genetic studies have led to significant changes in our understanding of relationships within phyla. Most seem to belong to two main lineages, deuterostomes and protostomes. Deuterostomes Deuterostomes differ from other phyla called protostomes in several ways. Both have a complete digestive tract. However, in protostomes the primary opening (archenteron) develops into the mouth, and the anus develops separately. In deuterostomes this is reversed. Deuterostomes have a dorsal, rather than a ventral, nerve sheath. and their germ cells undergo a different cleavage. All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages. The major groups of deuterostomes are Echinodermata and Chordates. The former are equilateral in shape, living only in seawater, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The latter are dominated by vertebrates, which are animals with backbones. These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Satonatha or arrow worms can also be deuterostomes. But recent studies suggest their protostome affinities. Ectyzazoa Ectyzazoa are protostomes. They are so named from their common habit of growing by winging or shedding (ecdysis). Arthropoda, the largest animal group, belongs to it. This includes insects, spiders, crabs and their relatives. All these organisms are generally divided into continuous body segments with appendages. Close relatives of Arthropoda are two suborders, Onychophora and Tardigrada. These share similar characteristics. Ecdyszoa also contain nematodes or roundworms. They are the second largest animal group. Roundworms are generally microscopic and can be found in almost any water-based environment. Many are important parasites. The Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and Kinorinja, Priapulita, and Loricifera are related suborders. These segments have a reduced coelom called pseudocoelom. The remaining two divisions of protostomes are sometimes grouped together into a single division called Spiralia. The reason is that in both the germinal cells are formed with spiral cleavage. Platyzoa Platyzoa includes the order Platyhelminthes and Platyhelminthes. These were initially considered to be some of the most primitive types of philateria. But it is now thought that they may have evolved from a more complex ancestor.[12] A large number of parasites such as flukes and tapeworms are included in this group. Flatworms are hollow.[13] Other Platyzoa phyla are mostly pseudocoelomates. The most important of these are the Rotifera organisms. They are most common in aquatic environments. These include Acanthocephala or needle-headed worms, Nathostomulita, Micronathosoa, and possibly Cyclophora.[14] All of these categories share complex jaws. Hence they are called Gnathifera. Lophodrozoa The Lophodrozoa include the two most successful animal orders, the Mollusca and the Annelida.[15][16] The second largest group of animals includes snails, clams, and clams. The latter includes segmented worms such as earthworms and cards. These two genera have long been considered closely related because of the trachophore larvae they have in common. But Annelida are considered closest to Arthropoda.[17] Because both have a stated body.[18] Lobotrosaszoa also harbors nemertia or ribbon worms, sipuncula, and several pods that contain a fan of a dense hairy structure around the mouth called a lophopore.[19] They have traditionally been grouped together as lophophorates.[20] But they are now considered to be paraphyletic,[21] some closer to the Nemertia, and some closer to the Mollusca and Annelida.[22][23] These include the Brachiopoda or lampreys, Enterophracta, Boronida, and possibly Bryozoa or bryozoans, which are predominant in the fossil record.[24] Model organisms Because of the great diversity found in animals, it is more economical for scientists to study a small number of selected species, make connections between the work of different scientists, and draw conclusions from them about how animals behave in general. The most intensively studied multicellular animal (metazoan) model organisms are the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Cenohaptidis elegans because of their ease of rearing and maintenance. They were also the first life forms to be genetically coded. The position of their genetic block facilitated this. But the flip side of that is that many genes, introns and genetic links are missing. Little can be learned about these ectyzozoans in general through animals. The extension of this type of evolution within the superphylum is revealed by the currently evolving crustacean, mollusc, and mollusc gene plans. A study of the starlet sea anemone genome emphasized the importance of coding sequences in sponges, placozoa, and zooanoflagellates in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancient genes unique to Imetazoa.[25] A study of the sponge Oskarella carmela suggests that the genetic makeup of the common ancestor of sponges and immetazoa was more complex than previously assumed.[26] Other model species belonging to the animal kingdom include the mouse (Mus musculus) and the zebrafish (Danio rerio). History of Classification Aristotle divided the living world into animals and plants. This was followed by Carl von Linné's classification in chronological classification. Since then biologists have begun to stress evolutionary relationships. So these groups are somewhat restricted. For example, protozoa were initially considered animals because they are motile. But now they are considered as a separate category. In Linnaeus' original classification, animals were grouped into three kingdoms: Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. The first and last four were brought into a single phylum called Chordata. Many other forms have been isolated. The above lists represent our current understanding of this section. However there is some variation by source.

"A pyramid (pyramid, Greek: πυραμίς pyramis[1]) is a pyramidal structure. Its base is mostly square. However, it can also take the form of triangles and other types of polygons. Because most of the mass of these buildings is located at the base, their center of gravity is close to the ground, so some ancient civilizations chose this form for erecting solid monuments. For thousands of years the world's largest structures were pyramids. The largest structures were first the Red Pyramid at Tasur Nakuropolis in Egypt and then the Great Pyramid of Ghubu. Of the old Seven Wonders of the World, only the Great Pyramid of Khufu remains standing today. It is mostly built of limestone; Some of the chambers are made of red granite. An architectural marvel, the Great Pyramid is built on 13 acres of land with 1,300,000 stones weighing from 2.5 tonnes (5,500lb). Each side of its square foot is approximately 230m (755ft) long. Its height when built was 146.5m (488ft). But the white Dura limestone at the top was stolen and used for construction in Cairo, making it 137m (455ft) tall today. However, it is the tallest pyramid. Among the pyramids built in the world, the largest by volume is the Great Pyramid of Zolula in Mexico. This pyramid is still being excavated. Pyramid-shaped buildings were built by many other civilizations, including the Egyptians, Mayans, and Sumerians. A glass pyramid is erected in front of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA is built of glass in the design of an Egyptian pyramid. Ancient Buildings Mesopotamia The Mesopotamians were the first to build the early pyramids called sikkurs. They were built using sun-dried bricks and all perished. Such sikkurs were built by the Sumerians, Babylonians, Elamites, Akkadians, and Assyrians in their respective regions. Egypt The Egyptian pyramids are the most famous and well known. Built of brick or rock, some of these are among the largest in the world. The surfaces of most of the pyramids were made of highly reflective white limestone. Thus they were seen from a distance with a glow. The crest or peak itself was made of granite or volcanic rock and plated with gold, silver, or a gold-silver alloy.[2] The Egyptians started building after 2700 BC [3] and built the pyramids until 1700 BC. During the Third Dynasty, King Yosar built the first pyramid by stacking six mastabas on top of each other. The Great Pyramids of Egypt are located at Giza. Most of the pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile. As of 2008, 135 pyramids have been discovered in Egypt.[4][5] The base of the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest pyramid in Egypt. It is considered one of the ancient wonders of the world. The limestone and limestone [6] embedded in the crest have fallen over time or been stolen and used for buildings in Cairo.

"Tamil Nadu is one of the 29 states of India. Tamil Nadu is also widely known as Tamil Nadu. Its capital is Chennai. Tamil Nadu is located at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. Its territorial boundaries are Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in the west and north. The state of Tamil Nadu has borders around the Puducherry and Karaikal regions of Puducherry Union Territory. It is geographically bounded by the Eastern Ghats to the north, the Western Ghats to the west by the Neelamalai escarpment, the Annai Mountain escarpment, and the Palakkad Pass, to the east by the Bay of Bengal, to the southeast by the Gulf of Mannar and the Straits of Baku, and to the south by the Indian Ocean. Tamil Nadu was known as Madras State in English and Chennai Province in Tamil. Protests were held to change it to Tamil Nadu. Sankaralinganar was resurrected after fasting for 76 days[11]. Later the name Madras State was changed to Tamil Nadu in 1969. Tamil Nadu is the 11th largest state in India by area and seventh largest in population. It is also the fourth largest contributor to India's GDP (as of 2010)[12]. In 2006 it was ranked tenth (sixteenth when including the United States) on the Human Development Index.[13] It is also the most urbanized state in India.[14] With 6% of India's population, it is the state with the highest number of commercial establishments (10.56%) and the second highest number of employment opportunities (9.97%)[15]. BC Tamils ​​have been living in this area since 500 BC. Tamil language inscriptions and literature dating back more than 20,000 years are available.[16]According to mythological tradition, Tamil is believed to have been taught to Agathiya by Lord Shiva.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . Tamil Nadu is rich in natural resources, temples inspired by Tamil architecture, hilltops, coastal resorts, places of worship of many religions; There are eight World Heritage Sites in Tamil Nadu.[25][26] Geography Tamil Nadu is located on the southern coast of peninsular India. In the north are the states of Karunadakam and Andhra, and in the west is Kerala. The Union Territory of Puducherry (formerly known as Pondicherry) is located on the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu. To the south-east of this state is the island of Sri Lanka. Unlike many other parts of the country, Tamil Nadu receives rainfall during the months of October – December from the ""Northeast monsoon"". During this period, the farmers depend heavily on the rains that come from the cyclones that form in the Bay of Bengal. Cauvery, the state's sixth major river, originates in Kodaku Hills in Karnataka state in the north and flows into Tamil Nadu. Vaigai, Tamiraparani and Palaru are other major rivers. Chennai, known as Madras until 1996, is the largest city and capital of the state of Tamil Nadu. Thirteen kilometers long and second longest beach in the world, Marina Beach is located in Chennai. Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, Salem, Thanjavur, Dindigul, Tirunelveli, Erode, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Tuticorin and Vellore are other major cities of Tamil Nadu. History Tamil Nadu was ruled by Chera, Chola and Pandya kings in ancient times. Also, the state is an artistic region with many temples and sculptures. A song depicting the borders of Tamil Nadu Vada Vengadam South Kumari Aidai Tamil component Nallulagam Defines that (Tolkappiyam, special crop, 1-3). The land where the Tamil people used to live was called Tamil Nadu. The following literature references may be cited as proof of this: Tamil Nadu to listen to Vayaka (Purananuru, 168:18) Tamil Nadu is surrounded by this sea wall (Patiruppattu, II Patu, Pathikam: 5) To know Tamil Nadu in the drawing of Imil Sea (Silapathikaram, Arangerukatha: 38) (Manimegala, 17: 62) in Tamil Nadu Marungil within the island of Sambudh. Tamil Nadu has a history of more than 6000 years. There are various opinions about the origin of the Tamil people living here. Some believe that the Tamils, who once lived all over India, were a sub-group belonging to the extra-Indus civilization. The southward migration of this race is associated with the Aryan invasion policy. According to this policy, the Aryan invasion from the north is believed to have pushed the Tamils ​​into South India, which includes the present-day Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. Regardless of the historical facts, the identity of the modern Tamil people can be said to have been developed on the basis of the above principles. The ancient Tamil Nadu, which included today's Tamil Nadu, was divided into various countries. Many royal dynasties came from time to time. The most prominent among them were the Pandyars, the Cheras, the Cholas, the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, the Vijayanagarats, and the Nayaks. The above-mentioned Madurai is located south of present-day Madurai and it is known through ancient Tamil literature that it was completely destroyed by an oceanic earthquake in later times. The Pandyan nation excelled in education and commerce. The people of Tamil Nadu had trade relations with the Greek and Roman empires of that time. Although subjugated from time to time by the Pallavas and the Cholas, the Pandyas were one of the most powerful royal dynasties in Tamil Nadu. From the 1st century AD to the 4th century CE, the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyars ruled Tamil Nadu from the 1st century AD to the 4th century AD. Among them, King Sengutuvan among the Cheras, King Karikal Cholan among the Cholas, and King Nedunjezhiyan among the Pandyas were famous rulers and became very famous. The Cheras were influential in present-day Kerala and Kongu districts, the Cholas in the areas that included Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli, and the Pandyas in Madurai, Nellai and South Kerala districts. It is believed that due to their alliance, Tamil Nadu excelled in their war operations against the rule of the Mauryan Gupta empires in the north. From the 4th century AD to the 9th century AD. In the early fourth century, unknown kings called Kalapraras ruled Tamil Nadu. Although their history is not known because they suppressed the Moovendras, the new kings of that time called the Pallavars were granted autonomy and only documents worth mentioning about them have been found. Historians say that the reign of these kings from 4th to 6th century AD is the dark period of Tamil Nadu. AD Later in the fourth century, the Pallavas came to the fore, building fine temples. They ruled South India for 400 years. They controlled most of the Tamil country with Kanchipuram as their capital. The Pallavas defeated the Cholas in the sixth century. It is believed that their influence extended to Sri Lanka. Mahendravarman I and his son Narasimhavarman were the best kings among the Pallavas. Pallavar architecture developed and evolved during the Pallavar period itself. The last Pallava king was Aparasidha. He was defeated by Adittha Chola in the latter part of the ninth century AD and the Pallavarakshi came to an end in Tamil Nadu. It is noteworthy that during this period (300 AD – 600 AD) the Buddha was very influential in Tamil Nadu.[27] 9 to the 13th century AD The Cholas came back to power in the ninth century AD. During the reign of Rajarasa Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas emerged as a powerful force in South India. Their empire extended to central India, Orissa, and even parts of Bengal. Rajarasa Chola defeated the Chalukya kings and Chera kings in the east. He also conquered some parts of Sri Lanka from the Pandya kingdom. Rajendra Chola further advanced and captured the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakhsati Islands, Sumatra, Sava, Malaya and Pegu with his fleet. He also defeated Mahipalan who came from the present Bihar and Bengal regions. To celebrate his victory, he built a capital called Cholapuram on the banks of the Ganges. By the thirteenth century the power of the Cholas declined. 14th Century After the fall of the Cholas in the 14th century, the Pandyas rose again. However, the upsurge did not last long. In 1316 the Khilsi rulers, invading from the north, besieged and plundered Madurai. The Muslim invasion rendered the Cholas and Pandyas powerless and gave rise to the Islamic ""Bamini"" rule. In response to the Islamic invasion, various small kingdoms came together to form the Visayanagara Empire. The various parts of the empire were divided and rulers called Nayaks were appointed to oversee them. The Visayas Empire, with Ambi as its capital, was prosperous and peaceful. However, the Visayanagara rulers were defeated by the Sultans of the Deccan plateau in the Battle of Talikota around 1564 and all the territories under their control were divided among the Nayaks. During Nayak's rule, Pattana Palayams were formed to reform the political systems of Tamil Nadu and the system of village self-government was abolished. Nayaks from Tanjore and Madurai rose to fame and renovated ancient temples. Present-day Kerala and the adjoining areas of Malabar were under the rule of Chera. The territory of the Cheras bordering the sea was open to trade with the Romans. Until the British invasion, the small area under Cheras rule remained largely uninvaded. 17th century A new chapter in the political history of Tamil Nadu began after the British established the East India Company in Madras (now known as Chennai) in 1639. They took advantage of the quarrels among the petty princes of Tamil Nadu to divide them and started exerting their power over them. Tamil Nadu and subsequently South India gradually came under British control. There were also many Tamil rulers who fought against the British during this period of their domination. Rulers like Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Ananda Padmanabha Nadar, Pulithevan, Velu Nachiyar, Maruthu brothers, Vandayat Devan, Akku Muthukkon, Veeran Sundharalingam, Ondi Veeran, Periya Kaladi, Theeran Chinnamalai led the forces to fight against the whites. 20th Century When India gained independence in 1947, Madras Province (pictured) (The Madras Province) became Madras State. But till 1948 Pudukottai princely state was under the rule of Thondaiman kings. It is one of the last remaining princely states of India. Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, West Kerala, South West Karnataka coastal areas came under Madras State. In 1953, the Telugu-speaking northern parts of Madras State were further divided into Andhra State and the Tamil-speaking southern parts into Madras State. In 1956, the western coastal areas of Madras State were divided between Kerala and Karnataka through an amendment to redefine state boundaries. In 1969, Madras State was renamed as Tamil Nadu. Kanyakumari District, a Tamil-speaking area in the southern part of Travancore-Cochin state, was formed and merged with Tamil Nadu on November 1, 1956. Heritage Tamil Nadu is known for its rich literary, musical and dance traditions that continue to flourish today. It is one of the most industrialized states in India. Subramania Bharati, V. U.

"In 1945, during the final stages of World War II, the Allies dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These two nuclear bombs are the only ones to have occurred in combat to date. According to the US government, World War II was ended by this atomic bomb. World War II would have lasted many more months if the atomic bomb hadn't caused havoc on Japan. More people would have died because of it. It noted that the United States has ensured that people do not die on a large scale. There is still a great deal of controversy around the world about the US government's justification for this massacre. The Last Stages of World War II During World War II, Japan was very aggressively fighting to become a superpower. A victorious Japan attacked and sank an American warship stationed at Pearl Harbor in the Pacific Ocean. It was then that the course of the war turned completely upside down. In the end, the US used Japan as a test site to detonate its newly invented atomic bomb. Atomic bombs were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by American warplanes. Ultimatum to Sappan to Surrender The Allies first attacked Sappan with incendiary bombs. Many cities were destroyed due to this. Later, the intensity of the attacks increased. On the European front, Nazi Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945. On the same day the ""Instrument of Surrender"" was signed. But the war continued on the Pacific front. Later, on July 26, 1945, the United States, the Republic of China and the United Kingdom issued the ""Potsdam Statement"" in which Sappan's government accepted defeat and demanded ""unconditional surrender"" or ""immediate and total destruction"" if it did not. It was said to be a team. The words ""immediate and total annihilation"" seemed to give a final warning that the Allies would have to drop a nuclear bomb on Sappan, as a successful atomic bomb test had been carried out ten days earlier. Sappan government ignored this warning of nuclear bomb attack. Two nuclear weapons developed under the ""Manhattan Project"" were dropped on Saban. The atomic bomb named ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and the atomic bomb named ""Fat Man"" was dropped on the city of Nagasaki three days later on the 9th of August. Japan was faced with unimaginable disasters. Evidence of that destruction still lingers in the country. The result was the first time in history that atomic bombs were used in war. The effect of these two bombings was terrible. Between 90,000-166,000 people died in Hiroshima and 60,000-80,000 in Nagasaki within 2-4 months of the bombs being dropped. It is noteworthy that half of those who lost their lives were killed on the first day of bombing in both cities. Hiroshima City Health Department estimates that 60% of those who died on the day of the bombing were from burns, 30% from falling debris, and 10% from other causes. In the months following the bombing, scores of people died from burns, radiation sickness, and serious illness from other injuries. The United States estimated the immediate and short-term causes of death following the bombing as follows: 15-20% died of radiation sickness; 20-30% died from burns; 50-60% died of complications from other injuries. The vast majority of those killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilians, not combatants. There were many military camps in Hiroshima alone. Names of Atomic Bombs The US nickname for the atomic bomb dropped on the city of Hiroshima was ""little boy"". Three days later, the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki was nicknamed ""Fat Man"". At 8.15am, the Sinnabaiyan Enolake dropped the atomic bomb 'Little Boy' on the heart of Hiroshima. 'Enolake' is the mother's name of Baltippets, the pilot and commander of the plane that carried the atomic bomb. As soon as the bomb fell, it exploded with a loud bang and flames were visible more than 2000 feet above the city. 90,000 people died. A total area of ​​about 16 km was completely destroyed. Buildings were razed to the ground. Because all communications were cut off, even residents and officials in other parts of Japan were initially unable to grasp the extent of the devastation. The headquarters of the Japanese army repeatedly tried to call the military unit in the city of Hiroshima. With no response from the other side, complete silence prevailed, leaving the Japanese military headquarters in confusion and panic. Due to the fact that the leadership of Japan could not fully realize the terrible damage that had occurred, a young officer from the leadership was assigned to go to Hiroshima by plane to learn about the damage that had occurred there. The officer rushed to Hiroshima by plane. After a three-hour flight and still a hundred kilometers from Hiroshima, he and the plane's pilot saw the sky filled with smoke. With great difficulty, they took their lives in their hands and diverted the plane to another area and landed safely. It was only after the young officer returned and told of the disaster that the world became aware of the atrocity. Sixteen hours after the bombing of Hiroshima, an announcement from the US White House made the Japanese headquarters aware of the devastation of the bombing. Studies conducted from 1950 to 1990 revealed that tens of thousands of people died from the toxicity of atomic radiation. Tens of thousands of people still give birth to fetuses years after this incident. Children are born with disabilities without body parts like hands, feet, eyes, and nose. The 'Fatman' atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki exploded and burst into flames eighteen kilometers high. As soon as the fire extinguished Jewel, thick clouds of poisonous soot floated overhead. Japan's report on the bombings noted that “the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were seen as crematoria without mausoleums.” By the third week of August, the United States was ready to drop another nuclear bomb. The US planned to drop three bombs in September and the first bomb in October. As the top military officers had mentioned in their reports that all these bombs could not be dropped without the written orders of the President of the day, the situation gradually changed and they were forced to abandon these plans. Surrender of Sappan On August 15, 1945, the sixth day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, Sappan surrendered to the Allies, accepting defeat. In September of the same year, Sappan signed the ""Japanese Instrument of Surrender"". Thus World War II officially ended. Is Nuclear Weapons Moral? After World War II, Sappan was committed to maintaining world peace. In 1967, Japan formulated the Three Non-Nuclear Principles (Japanese: Hikaku San Gensoku). The devastation of Sappan during the war led to the creation of Akkaya. The three philosophies of Sappan are as follows: Sappan does not produce nuclear weapons. It does not possess nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are not allowed to enter Japan. These policies echoed the overall experience of the Spanish people. They were passed as ""Resolutions"" though not declared into law by Parliament. The question of whether the Allied bombing of Sappan was the reason for the surrender of Sappan in World War II continues to be debated. Likewise, the question of whether it was morally right for the Allies to drop atomic bombs during the war, which caused terrible destruction and loss of life, is also constantly debated. Background to Atomic Bombing The Pacific War In 1945, the war between the Allies and the Japanese Empire entered its fourth year. There were no signs of an end to World War II. On the contrary, the intensity of the fight increased. 1.25 million US soldiers died on military bases during World War II; The intensity of the fighting is evident from the fact that approximately 1 million of them died in the 12 months between June 1944 and June 1945. In December 1944 alone, German troops killed 88,000 American soldiers in the Battle of the Bulge, known as the ""Ardennes Offensive"". Achanda saw the highest number of warrior deaths in a single month.[2] During the same period, Allied forces in the Pacific Rim captured the Mariana Islands and Palau,[3] moved on to the Philippines,[4] and then attacked Borneo.[5] Saban's policy of leaving troops was abandoned. In order to move their fighters to other areas of the fighting, the Allies launched attacks aimed at reducing Sappan's forces, which continued to fight on the Bougainville, New Guinea, and Philippines fronts.[6] In April 1945, US forces landed on Okinawa and continued fighting until June. The death rate among Japanese forces at the time dropped significantly from five to one in the Philippines to two to one in Okinawa. [2] Nasi Cerumani surrendered on May 8, 1945 in preparation for the occupation of Sappan. Prior to that, the Allies had begun planning and preparations for a large-scale war in the Pacific and the invasion of Sappan.[7] Dubbed ""Operation Downfall"", the plan consisted of two parts: 1) ""Operation Olympic""; 2) ""Crown action"". ""Operation Olympic"" was scheduled to begin in October 1945, and the US 6th Army Division was scheduled to deploy and occupy the southern third of Kyushu, the southernmost of the four major islands of Sappan. [8]Following that operation, ""Operation Crown"" was scheduled to begin in March 1946. Accordingly, it was planned that the United States First Division, Eighth Division, and Tenth Division would occupy the Kantō Plain, located near the capital Tokyo on Honshu Island, the largest of the four main islands of Japan. When the date for the invasion was set, five months were left to allow ""Operation Olympic"" to achieve its objective, bring troops involved in the operation from Europe to Sappan, and survive the snowy winter in Sappan.[9] Sappan easily learned that the Allies were planning to invade it. Its topography favored it. Sappan accurately foresaw the invasion plan of the Allies and devised a plan to counter the invasion. Saban's war plan was called ""Operation Ketsugō"". Accordingly, the Japanese stationed the largest part of their army to defend the island of Kyushu. This left a small contingent which could be called upon for continuous defence.

Power to Punish for Contempt of Court The Supreme Court has been empowered to punish any person who commits contempt of court as per the Constitution allowed under Articles 129 and 142. Suwarup Singh Naik, the current Minister of Maharashtra[4] was sentenced to one month in jail on 12 May 2006 for contempt of court in an unprecedented case. Misconduct and immorality of judges in India's higher judiciary,[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] [19][20][21][22] The most prominent controversy in 2008 was the revelation of the gross misconduct of the judges through their spending on the tax payers[23] during vacations, which led to the demand for the public accounting of the assets of the judges. The Right to Information Act[24][25][26][27][28] however revealed that it would be rejected due to knowledge. Supreme Court Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan's comments about his position have been criticized. These are his comments : — A judge is a public servant [29] who is in charge of a constitution. He later retracted his views[30]. It has been heavily criticized by current President Pratibha Patil and former President APJ Abdul Kalam as judicial dereliction of duty [31]. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made recommendations to strengthen the judiciary to deal with immorality (corruption) and root it out.[32] to resign No matter what crime a High Court judge or a Supreme Court judge is caught committing, there is no place in law to prosecute them. Two-thirds of the members of Parliament must vote to remove them from office. The National Judicial Council to Investigate Indian Cabinet Judges Bill 2008 was introduced by the Parliament and thereby introduced a National Judicial Council and a National Judicial Council headed by the Chief Justice of India.

A panel of Judges constituted under this Act will inquire into the conduct of Judges. Complaints of the Chief Justice or a retired Judge, and complaints by the person under sentence, by the person imposing fine, shall not bind this Court. And complaints which are incriminating, frivolous and aimed at tarnishing his integrity will not be accepted. Supreme Court Bench of Senior Judges, Justice P.N. Aggarwal, Justice VS Sirpurkar and Justice G. Singhvi — We do not certify that any judge is corrupt. Black sheep are everywhere. The question arose in the hierarchy here-Supreme Court Bench Judges[33][34] Senior government officials include former President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam — Prolongation of untimely cases leads people to extra-judicial acts-APJ Abdul Kalam[35] * Former President of India, Pratibha Patil in a seminar entitled: Reforms of Judiciary[31]: — Judiciary cannot escape the censure that outdated justice poses a huge threat to the society and that the courts give room for the promotion of illegal (lawless) groups. The time will come when the courts will serve as a beacon for the people to uphold the complete justice, truth, loyalty and faith that everyone expects as the machinery of the justice system examines itself. The performance of the judiciary is undeniably substandard and tainted. - Pratibha Patil Sessions Judges {| class=""collapsible collapsed"" cellspacing=0 align=center cellpadding=5px width=75% style=""background: Lavenderblush; border: 1px solid gray;"" |-style=""background:Beige;font color:black"" !colspan=3| Judges of the present session of the Supreme Court of India[36] |-style=""background:Darkblue;color:white;border-bottom:2.5px solid black"" !style=""background:brown;color:white;border-bottom:2.5px solid black""| வ.எண் ! style=""background:brown;color:white;border-bottom:2.5px solid black""| Judges |- | align=center width=25% style=""border-bottom:2px solid gray"" |1 | width=75% style=""border-bottom:2px solid gray"" |Justice K.

"The Nile (Arabic: النيل‎, An Nile; Ancient Egyptian: Iteru Yifi; Gothic Egyptian: ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲱ, P(h)iaro; Amharic: אבאי?, ʿAbbai) is the most important river in the northeastern African continent. It is also said to be the longest river in the world [1]. With a length of 6650 km, it flows through eleven countries namely Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea[2]. Among these, Egypt and Sudan are the countries that benefit the most from the Nile[3]. The Nile consists of two major tributaries, the White Nile and the Blue Nile. Of these, the White Nile is the longest. It originates from the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. From there it reaches South Sudan through Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Lake Victoria and Uganda. The Blue Nile originates at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows through the southeastern part of Sudan, joining the White Nile near its capital, Khartoum. The northern part of this river, from Sudan to Egypt, flows mostly through the Sahara desert. The region is known for its ancient Egyptian culture and the Nile River Civilization. Many settlements of ancient Egypt were located in this area. Name reason In ancient Egyptian, the Nile River was called Yiphi or Ituru. It means big river. The adjacent figure is an Egyptian hieroglyph used to represent the Nile River. The etymology of its current English pronunciation, Nile, is uncertain. It is believed to be derived from the Semitic word maru (meaning six)[4]. History The Nile River was a major factor in ancient Egyptian civilization. Many important cities of the time were located in the Nile Valley and its estuary. It has been prominent in Egyptian culture since the beginning of the Stone Age. Following a climate change around 3400 BC, drought occurred in many parts of North Africa and the Sahara Desert began to form. During that period, many tribes began to migrate to the Nile Valley region. It was during this period that the world's first village and agricultural society emerged. Yonile The Nile is estimated to be the fifth most evolved river to flow northward from the Ethiopian highlands. This primordial Nile is called Yonile. Its barriers are found in the desert regions west of the present-day Nile. Yonile, 23 - 5.3 million years old. This contributed large amounts of fossiliferous sediments to the Mediterranean Sea. Several natural gas wells have been discovered in this deposit area. Tributaries The drainage area of ​​the Nile River is 3,254,555 sq km. It is 10% of the total area of ​​the African continent. Its major tributaries are the White Nile, the Blue Nile and the Atbara River. White Nile The White Nile is the largest tributary of the Nile River. Its source is Lake Victoria. But some rivers join the lake too. So this is unacceptable. The White Nile is 500 km from Lake Victoria through the Iraiban Falls. Reaching Lake Albert via Yoga Lake takes advantage of the distance. The river in between is called the Victoria Nile. The river that flows out of Lake Albert is called the Albert Nile. After this, the Albert Nile enters South Sudan, where it is known as Baghar al Yabal. It joins another tributary known as Bagh Al Ghazal at Lake No. Bagh Al Ghazal is a river produced in the Saad marshland. Its total length is 716 km. Together, these two rivers form the water that emerges from Lake No, known as the Bagh al Abayat or the White Nile. It got its name because of white clay particles floating in this water [5]. Blue Nile The source of the Blue Nile is Lake Tana in the Ethiopian lowlands. Its total length is 1400 km. It is the most important river in Ethiopia. This river meets 90 percent of Ethiopia's drinking water needs. Also, 96 percent of Ethiopia's waterborne traffic is carried through this waterway [6]. However, the river has a significant flow during the periods of high rainfall in the Ethiopian plateau. At other times its current is very less. Especially at the end of August, the river has a flow of 5663 m3 per second, but at the end of April it has a flow of only 133 m3. Atbara river Like the Blue Nile, the Atbara River originates in Ethiopia's Lake Tana. 800 km from there. This long flowing river is 300 km north of Khartoum city. At a distance it joins the Nile. The Atpara river, which has flow only during the rainy season, is mostly dry during the summer season from January to June. current The flow of the Albert Nile, the approximate origin of the Broad Nile River, is 1048 m3 per second. It has a steady current throughout the year. After this, the Bagh Al Yabal River loses most of its water in the Saat Marshes. Approximately half of its current is accelerated here by evaporation, so at the end of the river its flow decreases from 1048 m3/s to 510 m3/s. The average flow of the White Nile is 924 m3 per second. It reaches a maximum of 1218 m3 per second in early March. The minimum volume is 609 m3 per second. This variation in the course of the White Nile is due to the flooding of a tributary called the Sobad. Of the total flow of the Nile, the share of the White Nile averages 30%. But in summer from January to June it increases to 70% to 90%. This proportional increase occurs because the flow of the Blue Nile during these months is less than 113 m3 per second and the Atbara River is almost dry. The share of the Blue Nile averages 70% of the total Nile flow. The reason for this current difference is due to heavy flooding in this river during the rainy season of August. At these times the flow of the Blue Nile is 5663 m3 per second. It is 50% higher than the conventional current. Before the construction of dams on this river, its flow was still 15% higher. The Blue Nile of those times had a maximum flow of 8212 m3 per second. Minimum size is 552 m3. Estuary The Nile estuary is one of the largest estuaries in the world. It starts in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, on the course of the Nile and ends in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a bow-shaped estuary with a length of 240 km from east to west and 160 km from north to south. Formerly seven branches of the Nile flowed through this estuary. But after the construction of several dams across the Nile, it has dwindled to two. Also the rising sea level has greatly affected this estuary. The famous ancient port city of Alexandria was drowned by such rising sea levels. It has been observed that the water level of the Mediterranean Sea may rise up to 30 cm by 2025. This rise could occupy up to 200 sq km of the Nile estuary. Water allocation problem The sharing of Nile water is a major political and cultural issue in the Eastern and Horn of Africa countries. Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya are opposed to Egypt's supremacy in sharing the Nile's water resources. According to the 1929 British-Egypt Agreement under the European colonial rule, the approval of the Egyptian government is necessary for the irrigation projects of other countries carried out in the drainage areas of the Nile River. This is a major factor in today's problems. The “Nile River Basin Initiative” is trying to solve this problem [7]. In February 1999, this organization was formed by the Ministers of Water Resources of nine countries namely Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and Congo. Eritrea is merely an observer in the system. The World Bank and some voluntary organizations played an important role in developing this system[8]. In May 2010, the five countries of this organization namely Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania came to a resolution among themselves. This resolution insists that the existing water distribution system should be reformed and the Anglo-Egyptian agreement of 1929 should be canceled [9]. Egypt and Sudan have expressed their strong opposition to this decision[10]. However, Burundi supported the resolution and signed it in February 2011[11].

"The skeleton of a normal adult human consists of the following number of bones: 206 (208 if the sternum is considered in three parts). This number may vary depending on anatomical differences. For example, a very small number of humans have an extra rib (in the neck) or an extra lower vertebra; Some of the fused bones are not considered separate bones, but the five fused vertebrae; Three (3 – 5) coccygeal bones together can be considered as 26 vertebrae 33.

"Indian Independence Day is celebrated on 15th August every year. This day is a public holiday to mark the independence of India from British rule on 15 August 1947. On this day the national flag is hoisted and saluted throughout the country.[1] On this day, the Prime Minister of India will hoist the national flag at the Red Fort in Delhi and address the nation. Then the freedom struggle martyrs will be remembered and honored. The Prime Minister will inform the people of the progress made by the country in the last year and the goals for the coming year. In each state capital, the state chief minister hoists the national flag and addresses the nation and provides welfare assistance. Similarly, the heads of the district government at the district level, its dignitaries in the government offices, headmasters/principals of schools, colleges or those who have been invited as special guests will hoist the flag and give special speeches.[2][3] See more History of India Republic Day Quotations External links Government of India website On the Encyclopedia Britannica site Category:History of India Category:Special Days of India Category:Agatu Special Days Category:Indian Freedom Struggle ",When did India get independence?,15 August 1947,73
"Tuberculosis (Tuberculosis) is a serious disease of mandarins caused by mycobacteria. Due to this the patient may die. This disease is mainly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum (Mycobacterium africanum), Mycobacterium canetti (Mycobacterium canetti), It can also be caused by microorganisms such as Mycobacterium microti[1]. The impact of the disease Although tuberculosis usually affects the lungs in the respiratory system, it can also affect the nervous system, lymphatic system, gastrointestinal system, bones and joints, circulatory system, kidney, genitals, skin and teeth. The disease is commonly referred to as TB. TB stands for T</b>ubercle b</b>acillus or T</b>U<b data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[2018,2025,3,3]}'>B Abbreviation for ERCULOSIS (tuberculosis). Although there are some drugs that can prevent the disease from getting infected, treat the diseased person and recover from the disease, scientists have not yet found ways to completely prevent the disease from occurring. The disease is spread through the air through coughing, sneezing, and saliva. Although most people are infected, it is in a 'latent' or latent TB stage. About one-tenth of those who develop symptoms later become infected. More than 50% of them die if they are not treated properly. Chest X-rays, tuberculin skin tests, and body fluid cultures are used to diagnose the disease. To cure this disease, various antimicrobials are combined and given for a long time. But the development of bacterial subtypes capable of resisting all the currently used antimicrobials (Multi Drug Resistance) is seen as a major problem. As a result, the disease becomes more severe as the population loses immunity to the newly developed microbe. Many scientists around the world are eager to find a solution to this through research. Vaccination called BCG is also practiced in many countries. A report by the World Health Organization says that one-third of the world's population is affected by this disease, and every year 80-90 million people are newly infected. Not only that, every second a new person is known to be affected by the disease[2]. The number of infected people is increasing every year [3]. Tuberculosis is seen as an important secondary infection in patients exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS [4]. According to a report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005, in 2003, 88 million people were newly infected and 17 million people died from this disease. Due to this disease, the highest number of deaths have occurred in the African country. , , . In developing countries, in 2004, 1.46 million acute (chronic) cases, 89 million new cases, and 16 million deaths were reported [2]. Also, due to immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) and the use of drugs that suppress the body's immunity, the disease is also spreading in developed countries. The disease occurs in 80% of Asian and African populations and 5-10% in the United States[1]. Classification The current classification system for the treatment of tuberculosis is based on the infectious nature of the disease.[5] SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS When the disease begins to worsen, 75% of patients have pulmonary tuberculosis (Pulmonary TB). Their symptoms are; Chest pain, expectoration of blood with cough, severe persistent cough for more than 3 weeks. Notable symptoms are; Fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pallor, very easily and frequently fatigued[2] In the remaining 25% of patients, the disease spreads from the lungs to other organs. This is known as Extra Pulmonary TB [8]. These usually occur in immunocompromised people and children. When this type of TB disease affects the nerve block (brain, spinal cord) it is called Meningitis, and when it affects the lymph nodes, it is called scrofula in the neck. Also, the double membrane of the lung cavity called pleura, gastrointestinal block, bones, joints, circulatory system, kidney, genitals, skin, etc. are capable of attacking and causing disease. When it affects bones and joints, it is known as Pott's disease. Miliary tuberculosis is a very serious disease. In this case, the infection spreads to the blood clot, causing small lesions that look like millet. The lesions are visible on X-rays.[9][10] Pulmonary tuberculosis and disseminated tuberculosis may occur in the same patient [11]. Causative agent The primary causative agent is the bacilli of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an aerobic bacterium. As it divides every 16-20 hours, it has a very slow growth rate compared to other bacteria (usually bacteria divide once every hour) [12]. (E.coli is a fast-growing bacterium that divides once every 20 minutes. Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a cell wall, it is classified as Gram positive because it does not have an outer phospholipid membrane. However, on gram staining, the high lipid in its cell wall is mycolic. Due to Mycoli acid, it is very mildly stained or not stained [13]. This Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria is a type of bacillus that resists weak antimicrobials and can survive for several weeks in dry conditions. Although it can only grow in the body of a host organism in nature, it can be grown artificially in test tubes in a suitable culture [14]. Scientists are able to identify these bacteria by using a standard microtiter from histological staining of mucus taken from patients' mouths. During common gram staining, although these bacteria are colored, when treated with caustic solutions, this bacterium does not undergo decolorization and retains some color, so it is classified under the category of acid fast bacillus (AFB).[1][13] The Ziehl-Neelsen colorimetric method is commonly used to identify these bacteria [15]. During this Ziehl-Neelsen staining, the cells of this type of bacteria are seen in a bright red color on a blue background. AFB can also be identified by Auramine-rhodamine staining and fluorescent microscopy. Also this bacterial species can be detected by two component, two step AFB cold staining method [16]. The M.tuberculosis complex includes three other mycobacteria that do not cause tuberculosis. They are M. bovis, M. africanum, M. microti. Among these, M. africanum is a major causative agent of tuberculosis in some parts of Africa, although not widespread[17][18]. Although M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, the subsequent introduction of pasteurized milk has prevented this cause from becoming a common health problem in developed countries [1][19]. Although M. microti is generally known to cause disease in immunocompromised humans, there is also the possibility that the susceptibility of this pathogen has been underestimated [20]. There are some other mycobacteria species that are capable of causing the disease. Mycobacterium leprae is capable of causing leprosy. Both Mycobacterium avium and M. kansasii belong to the category of Non Tuberculosis Mycobacteria (NTB). Although both of these do not cause tuberculosis or leprosy, they are capable of causing some pulmonary diseases similar to tuberculosis [21]. Infection and spread Tuberculosis is airborne and spread like ordinary tuberculosis. Air droplets 05-5µm in diameter expelled when a person infected with pulmonary tuberculosis coughs, sneezes, speaks or spits are capable of causing TB infection. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 disease-causing droplets[22]. Because the amount of pathogen required to cause infection is so small, a single airborne droplet can cause a new infection in another person.[23] A person who has continuous, frequent, and extensive contact with an infected person is more likely to develop the disease. An infected but untreated person has the potential to infect 10-15 more people per year [2]. People who live in areas where tuberculosis is prevalent, who inject needles that have not been properly disinfected, children who have been in contact with an infected person, who are taking immunosuppressive drugs, patients who are affected by AIDS, and workers who assist and provide medical assistance to tuberculosis patients are more likely to be infected [24]. ] In many people infected with the disease, the disease remains latent (latent TB). In this way a person with latent disease will not get new infections. Infection is possible only from a person with active TB [1]. The probability of infection depends on factors such as the number of non-infectious droplets emitted by a carrier, the nature of the ventilation in the area, the amount of time exposed to the pathogen, and the virulence of the M.tuberculosis strain [11]. In order to prevent the spread of infection, it is important to immediately isolate the person who is in the active stage of the disease and to carry out anti-tuberculosis treatment without delay. Under such treatment, he usually becomes non-infectious within two weeks. Transmission from a newly infected person to another in an active stage of the disease takes 3-4 weeks from the time of infection [25]. Eating meat infected with tuberculosis can also lead to infection [26]. Mycobacterium bovis is capable of causing tuberculosis in cattle[27]. Pathogenicity 90% of people infected with M.tuberculosis have latent TB infection (LTBI) without symptoms. Only 10% of those with latent disease develop active disease later in life [1]. However, without appropriate treatment, more than 50% of patients with the disease die [28]. Diagnosis A disease is diagnosed when the causative agent is definitely known from samples (saliva, pus) obtained for clinical tests conducted on symptomatic patients. Where this is not possible, the disease can be confirmed by X-ray imaging, as well as, or tuberculin skin testing. The disease is difficult to diagnose due to the slow growth rate of the pathogen. It takes 4 - 12 weeks for blood, or saliva samples, to be cultured in a laboratory at an appropriate facility. A complete clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis requires medical history, physical examination, chest X-ray, microbial smear, and microbial culture. Tuberculin test and serological test may also be done. Interpretation of tuberculin test results depends on factors such as whether the individual has already received the BCG vaccine and whether he has been in contact with others who have the disease [11]. Also, this test method can give false results in some other diseased and malnourished people [1]. Tuberculosis Prevention In 1993, the World Health Organization launched the Global Tuberculosis Control Program in view of the severity of the disease. Its goal is to prevent 14 million deaths from the disease between 2006 and 2015 [29]. Since humans are the only species susceptible to M.tuberculosis, it is believed that complete control of the disease is possible with the help of a potent vaccine [30]. In tropical countries where other non-tuberculosis-causing mycobacterial species are abundant, there is a natural anti-tuberculosis resistance [31]. TB prevention can be implemented in two ways. Detection and cure of disease Screening of those at high risk of disease, detection of disease, isolation of them, prompt initiation of appropriate treatment, and cure. This can prevent further spread of hemorrhoids. Prophylactic use Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine was introduced in 1921 to prevent tuberculosis in humans [32]. This vaccine is made by mutating Mycobacterium bovis to weaken the microorganism. After several years of continuous culture in artificial culture, the microbe has lost its ability to cause disease in humans. This vaccine has shown adequate efficacy in children. If this vaccine is used after an adult, it may not work properly. Vaccination BCG was the first vaccine against tuberculosis discovered between 1905-1921. This is the most widely used prophylaxis in children[33][34]. BCG vaccine should be given within four weeks of birth. A scar will be formed during this. This ointment should be given again within a period of six months to five years when the scar does not form. Seek medical advice immediately if the cough persists for more than three weeks Crowded places, houses with no sunlight, encourage the spread of the disease. A lack of fortifying food can easily lead to the disease Drink well-boiled milk or pasteurized milk to avoid cow's milk-borne tuberculosis. Treatment Compulsory treatment is essential for a period of six months. Failure to do so will result in the development of resistant pathogens and the disease becoming incurable. Drugs used are Rifampicin. Isoniasid Pyriminamide Ethambutol Due to the fact that M.tuberculosis bacteria have developed new strains that are resistant to some of these types of antibiotics (Multi Drug Resistance or Extensive Drug Resistance), sometimes the treatment is not effective [35]. History Tuberculosis is known to have existed since ancient times. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was discovered in the remains of a buffalo that may have existed nearly 18,000 years ago [36]. Whether Tuberculosis originated from cattle/cattle and mutated with the ability to infect humans, or originated from a common ancestor capable of infecting different species and later mutated is still unconfirmed [37]. However, M. bovis is a direct descendant of M. bovis, a more recent disease that infects cattle. It is clear that M. tuberculosis has mutated [38]. TB has been found in fossil remains of pre-human prehistoric animals (7000 BC)[39]. As well as B.C. 3000-2400 years old in the spines of the fruit bodies, destruction of these microorganisms was observed [40]. BC By 460 AD, tuberculosis was called Phthisis in Greek. Hippocrates knew tuberculosis as an extremely widespread and dreaded disease characterized by fever, often fatal, and bloody cough[41]. In South America, from about 760 BC to AD. 100 years later, evidence of tuberculosis was found as early as the Paracus Culture [42][43]. Earlier this disease was also known as 'melting disease'. The disease was called by this name because of the symptoms like coughing up blood, fever and pale body. The disease was also known by the name phthisis, the Greek word for melting. In one stage of the disease, the infection extends into the blood clot, where small, millet-like lesions are seen on X-rays[9][10]. It is called Miliary tuberculosis. The disease is also called 'Koch disease' in honor of Robert Koch, the scientist who isolated the Tuberculosis bacillus in 1882.[44] . In the pre-industrial era, the disease was considered leprosy. This is because after a family member dies of this disease, the other members of the family who are infected with this disease will gradually become ill. People used to believe that the spirit of the deceased was the cause of that land, and that it absorbed and destroyed the lives of others. And the symptoms of tuberculosis in humans led them to believe so. Symptoms such as red, puffy eyes, pale skin, extremely low body temperature, weak heart, and coughing up blood led them to such a belief. They thought that coughing up blood was due to absorption of blood. In the early 20th century, there was also a belief that tuberculosis was caused by self-indulgence[45]. It can be said that the study of this disease started from the book ""The Canon of Medicine"" written by Ibn Sina in 1020. He was the scientist who first recognized and declared it an epidemic, first associated it with cholera or diabetes, and suggested that it could be transmitted by soil or water[46][47]. He was also the creator of a method to prevent the spread of the disease[48]. In the past, treatment methods were generally based on dietary changes. Although the connection between pulmonary tuberculosis and tuberculosis was established by Dr.Richard Morton in 1689[49][50], it was not properly recognized as a separate disease until 1820 due to its many different symptoms, and in 1839 J.L.Schönlein Tuberculosis was not named until mentioned [51]. Dr. John Croghan, the owner of Mammoth Cave, brought some patients with this disease between 1838 and 1845, claiming that the constant temperature and fresh air inside the cave would cure them, but they died within a year[52]. The first clinic for this disease was opened by Hermann Brehmer in 1854 in Görbersdorf, Germany (now Sokołowsko, Poland) [53].

"Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) is a plant species that grows in tropical areas such as India and Sri Lanka. It depends on the plant species. It has herbal medicinal properties. It is a plant that originated in East Asia. It is also known as Chinese rose[1]. It is the national flower of Malaysia. It is commonly grown as an ornamental plant. In Ayurveda it is also known as Japa Pushpa, Rudra Pushpa, Rakta Karphasa. Propagation This plant does not reproduce by seeds. Easily propagated by stem cuttings. Rosa-sinensis, like most other species, has more than one complete set of chromosomes, a genetic trait known as polymorphism, one of many plant species. A side effect of the multilocus nature is that the phenotype of the offspring allows for a possible random expression of all (or any) of the characteristics of all generations that have gone before, the parent, or indeed any ancestor in a state that is different. With this characteristic, H. rosa-sinensis has created new named varieties, resulting in many new seedlings and often displaying bright individual flowers and held in judging competitions, passed hobby and recross varieties are popular. To add to the genetic possibilities, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis has successfully produced cold-hardy hybrids (see Cold, Hardy Hibiscus cultivars), cold-resistant Hibiscus moscheutos and many other North American Hibiscus cultivars. A plant is a hybrid of species. Often the offspring of these crosses is sterile, but some are even more complex and fertile, with an almost unlimited chance of increasing the final hibiscus rosa-sinensis varieties. It also attracts the training of these tropical plants all over the world, including the distances in the cold regions. Uses The flowers of this plant are used for hair beauty in many ways. It is also eaten by people in the Pacific Islands. This flower is also used in Chinese medicine. In many parts of India, the flower of this plant is used as a cosmetic, to warm the head and to worship God. Petals of this flower can also be used to polish shoes. In Jamaica, this flower is also used to dissolve the fetus in the stomach. Medicinal Properties Hibiscus flower has many medicinal properties. Its leaves, flowers and roots all have medicinal properties. Heals stomach ulcers and ulcers. (Afflicted people eat 5 or 10 petals of the flower daily to cure ulcers.) Hibiscus is the best medicine for women who are infertile due to uterine damage and women who are infertile in old age. (Grinding the petals of hibiscus flower and mixing it with buttermilk and eating it daily cures the diseases in the uterus very soon. Women who are not fertile will also become fertile.) Reduces menstrual disorders. (If Hibiscus flower is dried in the shade and powdered and brewed as a decoction and consumed, abdominal pain, headaches, fainting etc. during menstruation will be reduced.) Cures whitening. (A decoction of saffron petals and consumed cures blanching. Sales This plant can survive climate changes in cold countries like Russia. Hence it is grown as an ornamental plant in homes. A two meter (meter) grown plant is sold there for $250. Flowers The flowers are multi-colored and have multi-layered petals. Apart from this, multi-colored flowers can also be produced by crossbreeding.

"In mathematics, a function (function[1]) is a relation that connects every element at one point to a single element at another point. The first moment is called the amplitude of the bias and the second moment is called the parallelogram of the bias. The elements of the domain are called inputs and the corresponding elements of the domain associated with these inputs are called outputs. The moment of all outputs is called the amplitude or inverse of the bias. Usually the function is denoted by f. This symbol is the first letter of the English word function. A simple example of functions is: f(x) = x2 In this relation, each input x is related to its square. The output f(x) (read: ""f of x"") for the input x is f - If the input is –3, the corresponding output is 9. That is, f(–3) = 9. The input of a function is called the argument and the output corresponding to that input is called the value of the function. It is not necessary that the inputs and outputs of a function are always numbers. They can be elements of any moments. For example, the function number of sides of geometric shapes would associate a triangle with the number three, a square with the number four, and so on. A dependency can be represented in several ways: Dependencies can be represented by expression or rule. The study explains how to predict the output for a given input. Dependencies can be represented by graphs. Some dependencies in science are given in tabular form. A dependency can be represented by the interactions it has with other dependencies. Example: Inverse dependence, the solution to an associative dependence. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations of arithmetic can be defined as functions. Another important function defined in dependencies is the set of dependencies. In this process the output of one function becomes the input of another function. The input of a function and its corresponding output can be represented as a sequence pair. For example the sequence pairs in the example above are: <x, x2> (<–3, 9>). These pairs of sequences can be thought of as the axes of points on the rest of a graph of dependence drawn on the Cartesian plane. The moment of all dependences having equal domain and equal parallel domain is called dependent space. Attributes of the dependent field are analyzed in true classification and true classification. Intuitive explanation Dependencies are generally thought of as a machine that takes an input and transforms it into an output. Often the inputs are denoted as x or t (if the inputs are time). The outputs are denoted y. The function is denoted as f. The notation y = f(x) says that the function f has an input x and an output y. In y=f(x), y is dependent variable and x is independent variable. Frequently used dependencies are given special names. For example: The sign dependence of an integer x is defined as: sgn ⁡ ( x ) = { − 1 if  x < 0 , 0 if  x = 0 , 1 if  x > 0. {\displaystyle \operatorname {sgn}(x)={\begin{cases}-1&{\text{if }}x<0,\\0&{\text{if }}x=0,\\1&{\text{if }}x>0.\end{cases}}} The moment of admissible inputs of a bias is called the amplitude of the bias and the moment of available outputs is called the amplitude of the bias or the inverse of the bias. Moments of amplitude are also known as parallelograms. For example, if f(x) = x2 is a real moment of the relation, then its amplitude will be the opposite real moment and the parallel domain will be the real moment. This dependence is called the real value dependence of f on real numbers. It's not enough to just say ""f is biased"" without mentioning personnel and parallelism. f ( x ) = x 2 − 5 x + 6 {\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {x^{2}-5x+6}}} The term is not a formally defined dependency. It is a representation only if its domain is taken as a real moment subdomain of R, x≤2 or x≥3 and its co-domain is R.[2] Different odds may represent the same bias. For example f(x) = (x + 1) (x − 1) and f(x) = x2 − 1 both represent the same relation.[3] And a relative does not have to be marked only by chance or involve only numbers. The players and co-players of the dependencies can be at any moment. An example of this is a dependency with Tamil words as inputs and their initials as outputs. In general terms, a relation is a rule that connects every element x in the X term to a single element y in the Y term.[4][5][6] However it is not so accurate to consider bias as a rule.[7] A disadvantage of defining a dependency in this way is that the terms rule or linking are not already defined. An explanation of this kind of bias seems logically plausible but logically unsophisticated.[8] It is worth noting that inputs and outputs are ordered pairs anyway, although this informal definition is used in many books, especially textbooks.[9][10] A function can be described as a set of ordered pairs with the following properties: If (a, b) and (a, c) are both in the set, then b=c. This means that a set of pairs does not contain two different pairs with the same first element. If an element x is in the domain of a function f , then the sequence pair (x, y) contains a unique y such that f contains one. This discrete y is denoted f(x).[11] formal definition . Given two moments X and Y. A moment F is a representation defined from X to Y , whose elements are all ordered pairs (x, y) that have both a unique element y and a unique element y in X for each element x in X .[12] For example, the moment of the sequence pair (x, x2), (x is a real number) is a representation defined from real number to real number. A classifier defined from real to real is not the same as a classifier defined from real to unopposed real. Both are different. There are two different ways of defining dependency in this way. Mandate and co-tenancy may be explicitly or implicitly implied. The first type of definition: it consists of three elements ordered in the definition of dependence: (X, Y, F) X -population; Y - auxiliary personnel; F - Moment of (x, y) series.[13] In each row pair the first element is in the domain and the second element is in the parallel domain. Also a necessary constraint is that each element of the array must be the first element of the same sequence. Definition of second category: A dependency is defined as a moment containing ordered pairs. The first element of these sequence pairs can occur in only one sequence pair. Field of moment dependence of the first elements of series pairs. The second element is the reciprocal or amplitude of the moment bias. No details were given about the parallel candidacy.[14] [15] Contact: Dependencies can also be considered as a classification of interactions: A relation defined from X to a Y moment is a moment consisting of (x, y) ordered pairs. In such pairs, x ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and y ∈ Y {\displaystyle y\in Y} . A dependency can be thought of as a special relation that is left-integer and right-exclusive. Dependencies cannot be considered a type of correlation if the X and Y moments are not specified. The notation f: X → Y denotes a function f with X as prime and Y as coprobe. The moment produced by all the y's is called the inverse or amplitude of the slope. Amplitude does not have to be equal to its counterpart in all dependencies. The input of the bias is called the variable of the bias and the output corresponding to that input is called the value of the bias or its inverse. If an element x in a domain is associated with an independent element y of the parallel domain, it is called the opposite of x or the dependent value of x. The reciprocal of x subjoined under ƒ is denoted ƒ(x). A graph of a graph is a graph obtained by plotting points on the Cartesian plane that contain ordered pairs of graphs. The field X can be empty. If X=∅ then F=∅. Parallelogram Y=∅ If X=∅ and F=∅. Although such hollow biases are not commonly observed, they are assumed to exist in principle. Code A formal description of an association consists of the association's name, staff, counterpart, and linking clause. The code given below consists of two parts: f : N → R n ↦ n Pi {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f\colon \mathbf {N} &\to \mathbf {R} \\n&\mapsto {\frac {n}{\pi }}\end{aligned}}} First part, Also ""ƒ is a function defined from N to R"". The second part, "" n , {\displaystyle n,\,} n Pi . {\displaystyle {\frac {n}{\pi }}.\,\!} -is connected with"" also mean. The length of this chord is a natural number, and the parallelogram is a real number. The slope relates n to the number divided by π. In short: f ( n ) = n Pi , {\displaystyle f(n)={\frac {n}{\pi }},\,\!} can be written as f(n), read as ""f of (of) n"". But when written in short like this, Adaklam (N) and Parallelism (R) are not clearly marked. Types of bias Input bias Total dependency Two-way bias A multivariate function is a combination of two functions Total dependency Inverse bias dependent fields The moment dependent space containing all the dependencies defined from the X moment to the Y moment is called the dependent space. Its symbol is: [X → Y], or YX. Number the size of the field |X|; Let the number of co-players be |Y| If these are both finite numbers, the number of dependencies defined from X to Y is: |YX| = |Y||X|. |X| If Y is infinite and Y has more than one element, then the dependencies defined from X to Y are infinite. However, only a countable number of biases can be written as probability. Dependence, ƒ: X → Y If ƒ ∈ [X → Y] is clear.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization established to liberalize and supervise international capital trade. The GATT (General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)), which had been in place since 1947, officially became operational on January 1, 1995 under the Marrakesh Agreement. The World Trade Organization regulates trade between its participating countries; It provides a stable framework for concluding business agreements through negotiations. This system leads to amicable settlement of disputes between the two countries based on the agreements made with the World Trade Organization, which must be signed by the government representatives of the participating countries and ratified by their parliaments.[4][5] Most of the issues that have attracted the attention of the World Trade Organization (WTO) so far have been the previous inconclusive trade talks, most notably the Uruguay Round (1986-1994). The organization is currently busy implementing the outcomes of the Doha Development Partnership (or Doha Round) trade negotiations that began in 2001. It is a great effort to enrich the participation of the underdeveloped countries, which constitute the majority of the world's population, and to participate on an equal footing. However, ""ongoing negotiations between major agricultural exporters and countries with a large number of impoverished populations have been dogged by an allergy to the exact process of providing 'special safety nets' to the poor during periods of high imports. Currently, the future of the Doha Round is in question. .""[6] The World Trade Organization now has 153 members,[7] accounting for 95% of the total volume of global trade.[8] The organization currently has 30 visitors who are also looking to become members. This World Trade Organization has been regularizing its activities through the regularization of office work block meetings. They meet once in two years. A general committee of the members of this organization is responsible for the implementation of the policy-level decisions taken at the meeting and also for the administration. An officer elected by the office work block meeting will be appointed to preside over it. The headquarters of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is Center William Ruppert, Geneva, Switzerland. History World Trade Organization and GATT 1947 After the Second World War, various organizations - notably the Bretton Wood institutions, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund - established GATT, the predecessor of the World Trade Organization, to promote international economic cooperation. A comparable institution for doing business, called the International Trade Organization, was successfully negotiated through negotiations. The International Trade Organization, as a specialized organization of the United Nations, is capable of supervising other issues indirectly related to trade, such as employment, investments, doing business with short notice, contracts for consumer goods, etc., in addition to removing barriers to trade. But the United States and some other countries did not accept this agreement on the International Trade Organization, so it was not implemented.[9][10][11] With the absence of an international organization for trade, the GATT would 'recast itself' as an international organization within a few years of practice.[12] The GATT negotiation rounds began in 1948 and until the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995, the GATT was the only multilateral instrument that regulated international trade.[13] Between the 1950s and 1960s, despite efforts to implement a form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to function as a multilateral treaty-governing multilateral organization on an ad hoc basis for more than half a century.[14] Seven rounds of negotiations were held under the GATT from Geneva to Tokyo. The first round of GATT negotiations aimed to further reduce tariffs. Then, in the Kennedy Round of the mid-1960s, the GATT passed a section on trade promotion with the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Tokyo Round of the 1970s marked the first major effort to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and improve procedures, with a series of agreements that eliminated non-tariff barriers, in some cases adopting existing procedures in the GATT, and in some other cases leading to entirely new categories. Since some of these multilateral agreements were not accepted by all members of the GATT, they often provided default ""marks"". Many of these indicators were modified in the Uruguay Round, and they evolved into a variety of standards (obligations/mandates) agreed upon by all World Trade Organization members. Only four of them remained diversified (government procurement, beef, civil aviation and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members decided to eliminate the beef and dairy agreements, leaving only two.[13] Uruguay Round Just before GATT's fortieth anniversary, its members realized that GATT's methods were unable to cope with the new globalizing world economy.[17][18] In 1982, the Eighth GATT Round, known as the Uruguay Round, was held to address the shortcomings identified in the Working Group's Commentary (such as institutional deficiencies, instability caused by the spillover effects of some countries' policies on global trade, and GATT becoming unmanageable). - Launched in September 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay.[17] It was the largest trade-based and analogical franchise ever held: the negotiations transcended business practices and touched on many new sectors, notably trade in services and intellectual property, and reforms in business practices in sensitive sectors such as agriculture and textiles; All of the original GATT agreement provisions were reconsidered.[18] In April 1994, a working group meeting was held in Marrakesh, Morocco, concluding the Uruguay Round of negotiations and signing an agreement officially establishing the WTO regime, hence known as the Marrakesh Accords.[19] The GATT remains today the umbrella agreement on trade in goods of the World Trade Organization, which has remained in place due to the Uruguay Round of negotiations. forms the heart of).[17] GATT 1994 (GATT) agreement and other agreements have been legally sanctioned at the Marrakesh Final Meeting; They are recorded in a long list of 60 agreements, mergers, decisions, and adoptions. These agreements are structured around six main components: Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization Goods and Investment — Various agreements on trade in goods, including GATT 1994 (GATT) 1994 and Trade-Based Investment Measures Services Understanding — General Agreement for Services Intellectual Property — Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Dispute Resolution (DSU) Government Trade Policy Review (TPRM)[20] Office Working Group Meetings First Office Working Group Meeting The inaugural Office Working Group meeting was held in Singapore in 1994. At this meeting, among the four issues brought up for discussion for the first time, there were differences of opinion among the overdeveloped countries and developed and developing economies, and because of this they referred to the four as the ""Singapore Issues"". The second office block meeting was held in Geneva, Switzerland. A third office-building meeting in Seattle and a third in Washington ended in failure, with large crowds protesting and the police and national guard's handling of crowds drawing worldwide controversy. The Fourth Office Work Group Meeting was held in Doha, Qatar, a country in the Persian Gulf, and the Doha Development Round was initiated at this meeting. The meeting also allowed China to become a member, becoming the 143rd member. Fifth Office Working Group Meeting z This Office Working Group meeting was held in Cancún, Mexico, with a view to implementing the Toh Round Agreement. A coalition of 22 southern countries, the G20 developing countries, led by countries such as India, China [21] and Brazil, rejected the northerners' demands on Singapore's affairs and demanded an immediate end to EU and US subsidies to the agricultural industry. Talks then broke down and did not progress. Sixth Office Working Group Meeting The Sixth World Trade Organization Office Working Group Meeting was held in Hong Kong from 13 December to 18 December 1995. The four-year-old Doha Development Agenda was held with a focus on settlement negotiations and an aim to conclude the round by 2006. At the meeting, countries agreed to phase out subsidies for agricultural exports by the end of 2013 and subsidies for cotton exports by 2006. Among other concessions given to developing countries is an agreement to receive duty-free goods from least developed countries, underpinning the EU's ""Everything But Arms"" initiative. And the customs duties up to 3% are non-exempt. Other major issues were decided to be completed by 2010 after negotiations. Seventh Office Working Group Meeting The General Assembly of the World Trade Organization, on 26 May 2009, decided to hold the Seventh World Trade Organization (WTO) Office Working Group Meeting in Geneva from 30 November to December 2009. A note issued by AMBA President Mario Madus said that the shortcomings of the biennial meeting, which was the failure of the 2005 round of negotiations, had to be eliminated, and that the forthcoming 'minimalist' meeting would not consist of bargaining talks, but of ""small group negotiations"". Emphasizes situations in which negotiations take place openly and transparently, rather than as an organization and as a normal negotiating structure"".[22] Doha Round The WTO's current round of negotiations, known as the Doha Development Agenda, began at its Fourth Office Working Group meeting in November 2001 in Doha, Qatar. The Doha Round was an overt attempt to remove barriers and subsidies, particularly in agriculture, with a view to helping the world's poorest people, given the ambitions of globalization.[23] Its initial agenda was to strengthen the system by further reducing trade barriers, implementing new, modernized regulations, and fulfilling commitments already made to developing countries.[24] Despite several rounds of negotiations, office work block meetings and other meetings, the negotiations were very heated and no agreement was reached. Disagreements persisted on several key issues, including agricultural subsidies.[25] Tasks Among the various tasks of the World Trade Organization, researchers consider the following to be the most important: Overseeing the practical execution, management and operation of agreements concluded.[29][30] Providing a forum with a conducive environment for negotiations and settlement of issues.[31][32] In addition, the World Trade Organization's primary duty is to review and promote national trade policies, and to monitor and act upon the correctness of forward-backward harmonization and transparency of trade policies in the formulation of global economic policies.[30][32] Another key task of the WTO is to promote the understanding of WTO norms and chapters through technical cooperation and exercises as these conditions change for developing, least developed and low-income countries.[33] The World Trade Organization is also involved in economic research and studies: it produces assessments of world trade realities and research articles on specific topics and publishes periodic and annual reports.[34] Finally, the World Trade Organization has been working closely with Bretton Wood's two institutions, the IMF and the World Bank.[31] Principles of trade system All countries participate in the world stage and with a view to understand trade, they have defined the principles of trade and have given a shape to a structure called the World Trade Organization. This system does not define or specify consequences. That is, the organization regulates the games for commercial purposes.[35] Five terms are important to know about the pre-1994 GATT system and the World Trade Organization: Non-discrimination. It has two major components: the most-favoured-nation (MFN) regime, and the national treatment policy Both of these define goods, services and intellectual property in WTO terms, but their precise scope and nature differ for each category. According to these preferential country MFN terms, a WTO member must establish uniform rules for all trade affairs of other WTO members, that is, a WTO member must offer to offer to other members, without discrimination, the most favorable conditions it wishes to provide for a particular product when doing business. [35] ""If some concession is made to one, the concessions must be made to all remaining members of the World Trade Organization.""[36] National treatment means that both imported goods and domestically produced goods are treated equally without discrimination (at least after the foreign goods enter the market) and these terms are trade. It was created to remove non-fee barriers to doing so. (Example: technical standards, safety standards etc. discriminating against imported goods).[35] Reciprocal discount. The MFN rule also indicates a desire to limit the scope for free concessions arising out of the MFN rule and to have better access to foreign market participation. For a country to negotiate on this, the benefits must be greater than a unilateral liberalization; It paves the way for such gains through concessions.[37] Obligations for Structured and Forced Implementation. World Trade Organization members should list the tariff commitments and access mechanisms announced in multilateral trade negotiations in a time table with figures. Such timetables establish ""top-level commitments"": a country can change its structures, but only after negotiating with its trading partners, and in doing so they have to compensate for the impact on trade. If this is not satisfied, the country complaining of the offense may invoke the dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization.[36][37] lack of light WTO members must publish their country's trade regulations, bind institutions to review administrative decisions affecting trade, provide periodic information to other members, and promptly report changes in trade policy to the WTO. Such internal opacity requirements are supported by periodic country-specific reports (Trade Policy Reviews) through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) along with complementary links.[38] The World Trade Organization systems thus improve predictability and stability, eliminate further quotas and similar restrictive practices, and ensure that imports are free of restrictions.[36] Safety valves. Under certain circumstances, governments can regulate business. Three types of progressive appropriations can be found in this direction: regulations aimed at achieving non-economic principles, regulations aimed at allowing fair competition; and classifications that allow marking for economic reasons.[38] Exceptions to MFN policies are concessions to developing countries, free trade areas and customs unions. There are 11 types of groups in the inventory forum system, each performing a specific task. All members of the World Trade Organization participate in the committees. Although the Textile Watch Committee is separate from the other groups, it is also included within the Commodity Council. The organization has its own chairman and consists of 10 members. The organization has affiliations with several groups in the textile industry.[39] The Committee on Intellectual Property-Based Business Principles provides information on intellectual property in the World Trade Organization, news and official notes of the TRIPS Council, and the work of the World Trade Organization with other international organizations in this field [40]. Group on Services The Group on Services operates under the auspices of the General Assembly and is responsible for monitoring the functioning of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The Services Committee has three sub-committees: Financial Services, Domestic Disciplines, GATS Regulations and Personal Obligations.[39] Other Committees The general committee consists of a variety of committees, working groups and working parties.[42] Details of the groups are business and environment Trade and Development (Subcommittee for Least Developed Countries) Regional Trade Agreements. Restrictions on outsourcing. Budgeting, Finance and Administration. Parties doing the work Succession or Conformity Working Groups Business, Credit and Finance Business and Technology Transfer Trade Negotiating Committee The Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) is currently negotiating the trade round. Its chairman is the highest official of the World Trade Organization. The group is currently trying to find a compromise in the Doha Development Round negotiations.[43] Voting System The World Trade Organization operates on a one-country, one-vote basis, but so far no voting conditions have arisen. It is generally the rule of thumb to make decisions based on consensus, and the relative size of the market gives them bargaining power. The advantage of consensual decision-making is that it leads to decisions that are widely agreed upon by all participants. Disadvantages of consensual decision-making include long periods of time and many rounds of negotiations before a decision is made. Future confusion may result from the use of vaguely ambiguous terms for incompatible items in contracts for final results. The reality is that WTO treaty negotiations do not take place with the consensus of all members, but through informal negotiations by small groups of countries. Such negotiations are called ""green room"" negotiations (the color of the office of the World Trade Organization chief in Geneva), or ""mini-ministry"" when they are held in other countries. Such processes have been highly criticized by developed country members of the World Trade Organization, as they have been excluded from these negotiations. Richard Harold Steinberg (2002) argues that although the WTO's harmonized regime model led to legitimate initial negotiations, in the final rounds they favored Europe and the United States because of their powerful bargaining power and thus could not be considered an equitable development.[44] Settlement of Disputes In 1994, World Trade Organization members signed the Marrakesh Agreement under the title ""Final Act"" and expressed their understanding of the terms and procedures for the settlement of disputes (DSU) and agreed to implement it.[45] They regard dispute settlement as a central pillar underpinning the WTO's many forms of trade, and ""value it as their unique contribution to global economic development.""[46] Furthermore, WTO members can take direct action against any of their affiliate members if they believe they have violated the rules. Instead of taking action, they have voted to comply with the commercial system's multi-party dispute resolution system.[47] Implementation of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanisms would require separate DSB panels, an Appellate Body, the WTO Secretariat, arbitrators, independent experts, and a number of separate institutions.[48] Eligibility and membership The process of becoming a member of the World Trade Organization is individual for each country, and membership depends on the country's economic development and current trade performance.[49] This process can take about five years, on average, but may take longer if the country is not fully harmonized and political reasons are intervening.[50] As a private process of the World Trade Organization, approval is granted only if there is consensus among interested parties.[51] Accession Process Countries wishing to join the WTO must first submit an application to the General Assembly, detailing all of the country's trade and economic policies related to and related to WTO agreements.[52] An application to the WTO should be an agenda item and considered by an executive committee composed of all WTO members involved.[51] After receiving all the background information, the Working Committee will focus on the differences between the information provided in the application and the World Trade Organization regulations, and will scrutinize the applicant's international and domestic trade policies and laws. This working group would prescribe conditions and restrictions for an applicant country's accession to the World Trade Organization, and provide a time frame for compliance with WTO rules.[49] The final stages of compliance will involve bilateral discussions between the applicant country and the members of the Executive Committee and will explain the terms of concessions and tariffs and restrictions on market access for the supply of goods and services. Although the negotiations took place only between the two parties, the obligations of the new members were to be shared equally and equally with other World Trade Organization members according to the general non-discrimination norms.[52] Once the negotiations between the two parties are concluded, the Executive Committee shall provide to the General Assembly or Bureau Working Group meeting an annexation package, which shall include a summary of all meetings with the Executive Committee, the Protocol of Accession (a form of membership agreement form for members), and lists (the ""Schedule"") the obligations of the country to become a member. Once the General Assembly or Working Group meeting has agreed on the terms of accession, the applicant country must approve the accession package in its parliament before that country can become a member.[53] Members and visitors. The World Trade Organization has 153 members. (All 123 countries that participated in the Uruguay Round signed on to become members on the founding day, and all subsequent members later).[54] The 27 member states of the European Union are known as representatives of the European Community. WTO members do not necessarily have to be members of a sovereign state. Instead, they can be a fully autonomous separate entity that conducts trade relations with foreign countries and collects customs duties. This is how Hong Kong (literally ""Hong Kong, China"" 1997) joined the GATT system as a contracting state, and the Republic of China (ROC) (commonly known as Taiwan, whose autonomous status China has not accepted) became a ""single member"" of the World Trade Organization in 2002. The customs-imposed Taiwan, Penggu, Kinmen, and Matsu countries are members of the ""Taiwan"" (Chinese Taipei).[55] A number of non-members (30) are present as observers to the World Trade Organization and efforts are underway to make them members. Iran, Iraq, and Russia remain observers and are not yet members. Other than the Holy See, other countries must reach a negotiated understanding within five years of becoming observers. Some international intergovernmental organizations are also admitted as WTO observers.[56] So far 14 countries and 2 territories have not maintained official relations with the WTO. Treaties The World Trade Organization currently oversees about 60 different treaties, each of which has the status of an international legal text. Member countries must sign and ratify all WTO agreements upon approval of compliance.[57] A brief note on some important agreements is given below. Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) was implemented by the World Trade Organization in 1995. The agreement has three themes, or ""pillars"": domestic sourcing, market linkages, and export subsidies. General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) was developed to extend an agreement similar to the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Methods)) created for trade in goods to the services industry. This agreement has been in force since January 1995. Agreement on Trade-Related Purposes of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) The Agreement on Trade-Related Purposes of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) imposes less extensive quality controls on many types of intellectual property (IP). Negotiations on this took place at the end of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations held in 1994. The Agreement on Sanitation and Plant-Sanitation (SPS) The use of the Agreement on Sanitation and Plant-Sanitation – also known as the SPS Agreement – ​​occurred during the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the GATT's General Agreement, and has been in the works since the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995. has Under the SPS Agreement, the World Trade Organization has issued principles clarifying boundaries for harmful substances for use in food safety (micropesticides, biocides, testing and matching specifications) and animal and plant health (imported pests and diseases). Treaty on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) The Treaty on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) is an international agreement of the World Trade Organization. It occurred during the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on GATT, and has been in the works since the establishment of the World Trade Organization in late 1994. These work to prevent disruption to business due to technical negotiations, quality control and testing and certification"".[58] Review The objective of the World Trade Organization is to promote barrier-free trade and stimulate economic growth. Critics of free trade argue that income levels between rich and poor countries tend to diverge rather than converge (ie the rich get richer but the poor remain poorer).[59] Martin Khor, director of the Third World Network, says the World Trade Organization has failed to manage the global economy impartially and its operations are skewed in favor of rich countries and multinational corporations, leaving smaller countries with less bargaining power to suffer. that the Uruguay Round agreements with the World Trade Organization are of no use to developing countries, and that the market conditions for industries have not improved as a result; that little by little the concession given to the textile industry has been withdrawn and nothing favorable has happened to them; that non-tariff barriers ie anti-piling measures have increased; and claims that subsidies for domestic sourcing and agricultural exports are still excessive in rich countries.[60] However, Jagadish Bhagwati asserts that producers in poorer countries have too much tariff protection, and that those countries are more likely than rich countries to strike against hoarding or dumping in greater numbers.[61] Other critics say that labor relations and environmental issues have been overlooked. Steve Charnovitz, director of the Global Environment and Trade Study (GETS), thinks that the World Trade Organization ""must address concerns between trade and workers and the environment"".[62] Furthermore, trade unions scoff at references to industrial rights in advanced countries, and his argument is that the more the world trade system advances its policy of globalization, the more environmental and labor rights will fall behind.[63] On the other hand, Khore responds that ""if the environment and trade unions enter the global trade system, [...] social and cultural issues can in principle be accommodated"".[64] Bhagwati also criticizes that ""rich country boycotts are an atrocity to impose irrelevant agendas on trade agreements"". .[65] Thus, both Bhagwati and Arvind Panakaria of Columbia University criticize the introduction of TRIPs into the World Trade Organization, fearing that such anti-trade agendas could one day run out of control and cripple the system.[66] Other critics view the WTO's decision-making system as complex, inefficient, disconnected from the organization, and non-inclusive, and charge it with a small, informal steering committee (a ""consultative forum"") to facilitate consultation on trade-related issues among member countries. [67] The Third World Network has called the World Trade Organization ""a highly opaque international organization"" because ""developing countries, which constitute the majority of WTO operating systems, have no mechanism to truly exercise their power""; The network also insists that ""democracy should give opportunities to social groups and institutions to express their views and to base policies and decisions on them.""[68] Some non-governmental organizations, such as the World Federalist Movement, the World Trade Organization, have set up a parliament similar to democracy. It argues that the performance will be better, but other reviewers have not heeded this.[69] Some libertarians and small-state think tanks, such as the Ludwig von Mises Institute, oppose the World Trade Organization, accusing it of being a bureaucratic and anti-investment institution known for political interference rather than unfettered trade. H. Rockwell Jr. of Lovell, president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, says. . . What the World Trade Organization says is that US exporters should be barred from setting up branch offices in foreign countries, saving them up to 30% of the income tax they have to pay to the government. Now the American tax rate should be raised and other loopholes removed, otherwise there will be a situation of giving new subsidies on a large scale, which will greatly affect the inflation sector of our country. [...] Of late there has been much talk of foreigners hating the prosperity and civilization of our country, and seeking to do us harm in one way or another by way of revenge. By the way, here is another presentation worth pointing out, Islamic extremists are not involved; They are ambassadors and diplomats, and not names on the suspect list.

"Lemon (Lemon) is a terrestrial plant with the botanical name of citrus lemon (L. oozebac). Native to Asia, this plant is classified as a member of the Rutaceae family in the flowering plant subfamily. It grows mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. Lemon is known as a short herbaceous plant. A plant belonging to the flowering plant family that includes lime and tomato. Its fruit is generally used for its juice. Lemon has medicinal properties. Drinking lemon juice mixed with water and adding sugar or salt as desired is considered a healthy drink. In cooking, it is used to add flavor to foods. The oblong yellow fruit of the tree is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily because its juice has both food and purgative uses [1]. The pulp and skin are also used in cooking and baking called indusal. Lemon juice contains about 5% to 6% citric acid, making lemon juice a key ingredient in foods such as lemonade for its distinctive sour taste. The pH of lemon juice is between 2 and 3. Thus it is used as a cheap acid in teaching experiments in schools. History Although it is believed to have originated in the Indian state of Assam, northern Burma, and China, exact information about its origin is unknown [1]. A study of hybrids between bitter orange (sour orange) and citron is known to be a study of lemon genetics [2][3]. Lemon cultivation was introduced in Europe near southern Italy in the late second century AD in ancient Roman society[1]. However, it is not widely cultivated here. In South Asia and Southeast Asia, it is used as an antiseptic. It is also used as an antidote to many types of toxins. Later it was introduced to Persia and from there to Iraq and Egypt around 700 AD. The first records of it are found in agricultural texts of the tenth century AD. It was also used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens. Between 1000 and 1150 AD, the lemon spread throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean region.[4] [1] Substantial cultivation of lemons began in Genoa, Europe in the mid-15th century. Lemons were introduced to the Americans in 1493 when Christopher Columbus brought lemon seeds on his voyage to Izpaniola. Spanish conquest helped spread lemon seeds throughout the New World. It was mainly used as an ornamental plant and medicinally [1]. In the 19th century, lemons were widely cultivated in Florida and California [1]. In 1747, Yemsu Lindu is known to have mixed lemon juice with his sailors who were suffering from scurvy. It is noteworthy that vitamin C was not discovered at that time [1][5]. The word lemon is thought to have originated from the Middle East. Although found in Old French as limon, in Italian as limone, in Arabic as laymūn or līmūn, in Sanskrit as nimbū, “lime” and in Persian as līmūn, limon is generally given everywhere as a citrus fruit [6]. A daily market for lemons is held in Puliangudi town of Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu. Punnaiyapuram village near Puliangudi is the best place for lemon growing. Its advantage is that it takes longer than other lemons to lose juice (water) in this region's lemons.[7] Varieties 'Boni Brei' are long, smooth, thin-skinned, and seedless cultivars[8]. Grows mostly in San Diego County, California.[9] Eureka lemon is a plant that grows abundantly throughout the year. It is also known as the 'plant of four seasons' due to its ability to produce fruits and flowers together throughout the year [10]. Commonly sold as supermarket lemon[11]. The Eureka lemon is found to have green and yellow colored outer skin with pink-fleshed [12]. The lemon is thought to be native to the town of Pemminello St. Teresa', or Sarrento, in Italy [13]. It is traditionally used in the preparation of the Italian drink Ilemoncello. Meyer lemons appear from cross-hybridization with lemons and oranges. Introduced to America in 1908 by Frank N. The fruit is named after Meyer. Meyer lemons have thinner skins and less acidity than Ilisuban and Eureka lemons. While not widely grown on a commercial basis, Meyer lemons require more attention. It usually ripens to a yellowish orange color. It is more frost tolerant than other lemons. 'Ponderosa' lemons are more cold-hardy than regular lemons. The fruit is thick-skinned and large in size. It is a citron-lemon hybrid. 'Yen Pen' is a lemon variety cultivated by Australian aborigines [14]. Citrus orangium, known as Narthankai, Citrus reticulata, Kamala orange, Citrus sinensis, Sathikudi, are similarly classified citrus plants. Garden lemons require a minimum temperature of 7°C, so they are not hardy in temperate climates, but hardy at maturity. The branches that need to be shortened as they grow are cut and shortened. Too many branches encourage bushy growth. Grows very vigorously, throughout the summer. Uses It is used as medicine and food for diseases like chikarvi, gout, rheumatism. It is used to make pickles, medicines, candy, fruit juice etc. Lemon is used in the preparation of aromatic oils and soaps. Lemon is also said to boost the immune system [15]. Nutrients and Phytochemicals Lemons are high in vitamin C. Other essential nutrients are mixed in small amounts. Lemons Lemons also contain a variety of phytochemicals, including polyphenols, terpenes, and tannins [16]. Like other citrus fruits, it is packed with a significant concentration of citric acid.

"Tobacco is an agricultural product. It got its name tobacco because it is used for smoking or snuffing. People who are used to smoking it become addicted to that habit [2]. Tobacco is made from the leaves of the Nicotine plant. It has been used in America since ancient times. Since Europeans arrived in the Americas it has become a commercial commodity as well as a popular recreational item. Thus, it helped the economic development of the southern part of the United States. Its predominance as a cash crop continued until the introduction of cotton in these regions. It belongs to the Solanaceae family and includes many species of tobacco in the genus Nicotina. The breed was named in honor of Jean Nicot de Villamain, the French Ambassador to Portugal[3]. He sent it to the court of Catherine de' Medici in 1560 as an apothecary. The effect it has on the human body is significant depending on the method and dosage of its use. The most important health hazard caused by its use is circulatory disorders. Smoking, over time, deposits large amounts of cancer-causing substances in the mouth, throat, and lungs. In 2008 the World Health Organization condemned tobacco as a leading cause of death.[4] Etymologically the leaves are used for smoking, hence the name tobacco. Also, it is given as tobacco cigar in Tamil because dried and powdered tobacco is rolled into fine particles and rolled inside the leaf. The English word tobacco is derived from the Spanish and Portuguese word tobaco. Tubaq (طُباق ṭubāq) from Arabic in the 9th century refers to a variety of medicinal herbs. From this there are references to Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin usage after 1410.[5][6] History According to history, tobacco was discovered by South American people and spread to America, by the Spanish to Europe and then to other countries. Traditional use Tobacco has been used in the Americas since 1400–1000 BC, and is known to have been cultivated in Mexico.[7] Native Americans cultivated and used them. Northeastern Americans used it as a trade item in their handbags, as a social ceremonial item, and for commercial contracts.[8][9] Sometimes people used it as a gift from their god and as a prayer object in religious worship according to people's belief.[10] Popularity With the arrival of Europeans, the use of tobacco from the Americas began to spread commercially to European countries. In 1559, the seeds were brought and spread to the West by Hemandes de Pancalo under the orders of King Philip (II) of Spain. In the 1700s it spread to Europe and its colonies as a major plant for smoking, chewing, and snuff. [11][12] In the 18th century it was a major cash crop in Cuba and the Caribbean. Cuban cigars are world famous. A device invented by James Panchok in the 19th century made the production of tobacco cigarettes quick and easy. This helped in the development of the tobacco business. Tobacco production continued to grow until the end of the 20th century, when awareness of the dangers of tobacco became widespread.[13][14] Introduced to India in the 17th century.[15] Modern Use In the mid-20th century, due to various scientific discoveries and knowledge of the effects of tobacco, tobacco control began to gain importance. Cancer, respiratory disorders, and circulatory system effects from tobacco have been investigated. Annual contract amounts received for advertising, marketing, etc. of tobacco products by tobacco contracts awarded in the United States. In 2003, 168 countries signed the World Health Organization's recommendations on the harms of tobacco, the importance of control, and awareness campaigns.[16] Phyto-biological Tobacco is an annual cash crop of garlic. The Nicotiana genus of the Solanaceae family has several subspecies. BIOCHEMICAL-Nicotine The alkaloids of the nicotinate plant are addictive and addictive. It also acts as a nerve agent in insects. The dry state of tobacco contains 0.6% to 3.0% nicotine. Nicotine acts as a primary agonist (agonist) at acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), except for its two subunits (nAChRα9 and nAChRα10). These interact with the brain and cause tobacco addiction. Once tobacco is consumed, it enters the blood stream as a molecule of nicotine and reaches the brain within 10-20 seconds. It makes the present momentary for a few seconds and forces it to consume.[17] AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION Like other crops, tobacco is grown through seeds. The cash crop tobacco seeds are sown on the surface of well-drained soil. They sprout and sprout due to external factors like sunlight, water etc. Tobacco seedbeds in Geneva are sown in a compost bed of sawdust or horse manure. Some weevils (Epitrix cucumiris, A. pubescens) cause disease in tobacco. In 1876, 50% of tobacco cultivation was affected. Later loss was controlled by pest control measures adopted in the 1890s. Cultivation & Processing of Tobacco Well-grown tobaccos are harvested, or pinched and processed (a) Processing of tobacco. Thus the moisture, greenness etc. in the tobacco is completely/partially removed and the taste and aroma are enhanced. Tanning Methods Air Tanning Tanning in fire Sun tanning Tanning in the shade Heat tanning Tanning and tanning Varieties are types of tobacco, Aromatic tobacco Smoke is lit by small fires, and the aromatic and flavorful tobaccos are consumed in tobacco pipes. They are mostly grown in Virginia, Tennessee, and western Kentucky in the United States. Fire-cured tobacco is used in parts of Kentucky and Tennessee as chewing tobacco and in cigarettes. Latakia tobacco Latakia tobacco is the most popular tobacco in the port city of Latakia, Syria. It is currently produced mainly on the islands of Cyprus. After the leaves are harvested they are dried in sunlight and then filled in the barn and then fumigated (a) is sensitized. Bolivilai tobacco Until the American Civil Wars, charred cane leaves were the most widely used. After 1812, the production and selection of soft, smooth, highly flavored and aromatic tobacco was essential. Various methods of sensing were tried as late as 1839 by various researches by American farmers. In 1839, Stephen Boleyville, an employee of North Carolina sailor Abisha Slade, accidentally discovered tobacco. He used coal to light the fire. Thus dried tobaccos of pale yellow (a) gold color were obtained.

These include China (39.6%), India (8.3%), Brazil (7.0%) and the United States (4.6%).[19] Major tobacco producing countries in percentage. China China is the world's leading producer of tobacco. About 20 million rural and rural Chinese people produce it on an area of ​​about 2.1 million hectares.[20] Though leading in tobacco production, these are not profitable cash crops like cotton and sugarcane. Because the Chinese government taxes, controls, and sets market prices for tobacco. Established in 1982, the China Tobacco Control Priority Management Association (STMA) oversees China's border tobacco production, marketing, export, import, and 12% gross national income growth. And to control tobacco production, Chinese government agencies levy taxes on retailers. The Tobacco Center is headquartered in Guntur, Andhra state, India.[21] About 96,865 certified farmers are engaged in this industry in India.[22] And many are cultivating without permission. About 3120 tobacco production centers are operating across the country.[23] About 0.25 percent of the total agricultural land in the country is used for tobacco cultivation.[24] Brazil About 1,35,000 farming families in Brazil are engaged in tobacco-based industries as their main economic livelihood.

Tobacco and smoking-related deaths Tobacco is a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide. A person loses approximately 11 minutes of their life when smoking one cigarette. Every 6 seconds, one death in the world is caused by tobacco. Smokers have a 60-80% higher than normal mortality rate.[26] About 5 million people die each year from tobacco-related diseases.[27][28] Cancer Tobacco use increases the risk of cancer. as proof, Lung cancer,[29] Laryngeal and neck cancer,[30][31] Blood, vascular cancer,[32] Kidney cancer,[33] Oral, esophageal cancer,[34] Pancreatic cancer,[35] Stomach cancer,[36] Lung damage reduces lung growth. The airway begins to narrow. Tobacco smoking is a major cause of lung damage and various respiratory diseases. Other effects include cardiovascular disease - increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, hardening of the blood vessels. Disturbance of mouth, smell, taste – causes discoloration of gums in mouth. Taste reduces consumption. Smoke causes eye problems. Strokes, Mental Illnesses – Smoking affects the brain and causes strokes. Kidney disease infection Impotence Female infertility Pregnancy problems Drug interactions World No Tobacco Day World No Tobacco Day is observed by the World Health Organization on 31st May every year. Environmental Risk In 2017, the World Health Organization released an awareness report on tobacco and its environmental pollution. [37] Tobacco-related waste pollutes the environment by releasing more than 7,000 toxic chemicals and human carcinogens.[38] About 1,000 tons of tobacco smoke releases human carcinogens into the atmosphere. Out of the 15 billion cigarettes sold daily, about 10 billion cigarette wastes are released into the environment. About 30%-40% of beach and rural litter consists of cigarette butts. Economics & Advertising Considering the harmful, side effects of tobacco, various restrictions and bans on tobacco advertising and marketing are being observed all over the world. In India, tobacco products should carry pictures about the dangers of tobacco. Smoking is prohibited in public places. Film for Tobacco Control Board of India and Health Awareness, In films, smoking awareness scenes should be included in the credits, intermissions and endings. When there are scenes of smoking in films, slogans such as ""Smoking is harmful"" should be included in international and national languages.

"Smallpox is a highly contagious disease that affects only humans. It is caused by two highly virulent organisms, Variola major and Variola minor.[1] Among these, variola maser is capable of causing more casualties. 20 to 40 percent of those infected die. Only one percent of people infected with variola minor die. Many survivors are left blind in (one or) both eyes and permanently scarred. 300-500 million people died from this disease in the 20th century. According to a report published by the World Health Organization in 1967, 15 million people were infected with the disease that year alone, and two million of them died. Edward Jenner discovered a vaccine for this disease in 1796. Janet Parker died of the disease in September 1978 in the United Kingdom. After that the attack of this disease was not known anywhere. History The first appearance of smallpox is still unknown. But over the centuries, this deadly disease has struck different parts of the world. Below is the timeline[2] for this 3rd century - The mummy of Pharaoh Ramses, who lived in Egypt, showed signs of smallpox. This is proof that smallpox was present in the world in the 3rd century. 4th century - In China, the symptoms of this disease were recorded in writing in the 4th century. It is also mentioned that people should pray to God 'Yo Ho Long' to heal them from this disease. 6th Century - A period of increased trade between China and Korea, the 6th century. Through this, smallpox began to spread to Korea and Japan. The myth that 'red colour/light cures smallpox' is believed all over the world. Similarly in Sappan culture, victims of smallpox wore red clothes.[3] 7th century - In the 7th century, it spread to the Indian subcontinent. Later, it started spreading to North Africa through the Arabs. 10th Century - At the beginning of the 10th century, countries such as Greece, Turkey, and Romania were affected by smallpox. Smallpox is thought to have spread through trade in the Asian continent. 11th century - Smallpox spreads across continental Europe. It is thought to have spread when European Christians migrated to the Middle East due to the Crusades. 13th century - Smallpox spread to the northern European country of Iceland due to population growth and increased number of travelers traveling the world. 15th Century - In the 15th century, smallpox became widespread in Europe. Smallpox was brought to East Africa by the sea voyages of Portuguese people 16th century - Smallpox spread to the Americas due to European settlement and the African slave trade. In 1520, the Spanish spread smallpox to present-day Mexico. Smallpox is also considered to be a major reason for the destruction of the Aztec civilization that lived there at that time. Meanwhile, in the 16th century, the smallpox vaccine known as variolation was widely practiced in China and India. Variolation is the practice of taking the poultice of a smallpox victim after drying it well and pulverizing it. People who are not affected by smallpox should inhale this powder. By this they controlled smallpox. 17th century - 'Variolesan' method of prevention also started to be adopted in Ottoman Empire. To this end, in Turkey and North African countries, this method of prevention was used. 18th century - 'Variolesion' method of prevention was introduced in England by 'Lady Mary Wardley Montagu'. She is the wife of the British Ambassador to Turkey. When she contracted smallpox in Turkey, she gave her two children the variolasan vaccine. Meanwhile, in 1796, 'Edward Jenner' proved that smallpox could be prevented through cowpox. This formed the basis of vaccination against smallpox. 20th Century - In the 20th century, smallpox was still found in Africa, Asia and South America. It was largely controlled by vaccination in the European and North American continents. Smallpox was completely eradicated in 1980 through a global eradication campaign. Symptoms A smallpox sufferer must go through the following stages before recovery. Each phase has certain signs and symptoms. [4] 1) Measles: During this period, the pathogen of smallpox is multiplying in the human body. But no symptoms are known. Symptoms: No Duration: Lasts 7 - 19 days (most often 7 -14). Contagiousness: No 2) Initial symptoms: At this stage, the sufferers are so exhausted that they are unable to do any work. Symptoms: High fever, headache, body aches and occasional vomiting Duration: 2 - 4 days Prevalence: Sometimes 3) Early Canker sores: Small canker sores, first appear on the tongue or mouth. Once these tumors become inflamed and burst, the pathogen can spread widely throughout the body. Starting on the face, within 24 hours, pimples start to appear all over the body, up to the arms and legs. At the moment such lumps appear, the fever is slightly isolated. By the fourth day, all the lumps are thickened and ulcerated. This ulcer contains a thick, cloudy fluid. At this point the fever will rise again Symptoms: high fever, thick, fuzzy blisters all over the body Duration: 4 days Contagiousness: Yes, highly contagious phase 4) Pustular blisters and pustules: In this phase, the sores on the body turn into blisters. These blisters are slightly raised, round and appear like a pea inside the skin to the touch. After about 5 days, these blisters form crusts and then crusts. Pustules are crust-like deposits on a dry sore. Symptoms: Blisters and warts Duration: Lasts about 10 days Transmissibility: Yes 5) Falling of warts: At this stage, the dry warts begin to fall off. Although dry, it is still contagious. So be careful. After shedding, the body will have scars. Symptoms: Shedding Period: Lasts up to 6 days Transmissibility: Yes 6) Absence: After all the scabs are shed, the disease is not contagious. It is a sign of complete recovery for a person suffering from smallpox. Contagiousness: No Medical Treatment There is no medical treatment for smallpox. No single treatment will help. However, sometimes some anti-toxin and some anti-microbial drugs may be prescribed.[5] These are not for smallpox toxin. Smallpox can be given to prevent other diseases. PREVENTION Since there is no medical treatment for smallpox, prevention is best. There are vaccines for this. If taken before the smallpox virus strikes, the disease can be completely prevented If taken within 3 days of exposure, the vaccine will prevent the virus from multiplying. This will not affect it If taken within 4-7 days of the attack, it can protect against the disease. However, if the disease subsides, its impact is likely to be minimal [6]. Eradication Smallpox was considered a very deadly disease due to its contagious nature. Although smallpox vaccines were available in the early 19th century, the disease continued to spread throughout Africa and Asia. It was only in 1959 that the World Health Organization decided to eradicate smallpox completely. Due to lack of funds and insufficient volunteers, it could not be implemented successfully. In 1967, the effort was again intensified. The Last Appearances of Eradicated Chronological Smallpox, [7] Continent of North America - 1952 South America Continent - April 19, 1971 (Brazil) Continent of Europe - 1953 Continent of Africa - October 12, 1977 (Somalia) Asia Continent - October 16, 1975 (Bangladesh) Continent of Australia - There is no indication that the disease has spread here The Last Appearance In 1975, Rahima Banu, a 3-year-old girl in Bangladesh, became the last person to recover naturally from smallpox (variola maser). On October 12, 1977, Ali Mao Malin, a cook, contracted smallpox and recovered. In 1978, Janet Parker, a medical photographer, contracted smallpox while researching and died on September 11. Smallpox was officially declared eradicated by the World Health Assembly on May 8, 1980.[8] It has been 27 years (as of 2017) since smallpox was completely eradicated from the world.

"Main Page The Story of my Experiments with Truth is a biographical book written by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi has described his life as an open book, describing his entire life as a researcher's research journey. He mentioned the unforgettable parts of his life as lessons to remind the society. All of them, he thought, were trials of truth. So he named this book Sathyasothanai. Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote his story from his youth to 1921 as the story of my truth test. A collection of his articles in Gujarati from 1925 to 1929 in Navajeevan Weekly. Its English translation was also published in the English journal ""Young India""[1] mainly due to the inspiration of Swami Anand and those who worked with him. They encouraged Gandhiji to share the background of his public life. The book was selected by the World Commission on Spirituality and Religion as one of the 100 Greatest Spiritual Books of the 20th Century [2]. English Translator's Preface Mr. Mahadev Desai, who translated this book written by Gandhiji in Gujarati into English in 1940, mentions in his preface that he published the first volume in 1927 and the second volume in 1929. He fixed the price of the book at one rupee and 50,000 copies in Gujarati before the preface was written. He mentions that it was sold out and Indians were unable to buy English books due to high prices. He also mentions the need to make English books affordable. He also mentions that Chapter 29 to Chapter 43 of Part 5 was translated by Pyarilal, a friend of Mr. Desai.[3] Preface Gandhiji himself wrote the preface to this book. He mentions that he decided to write this story only on the insistence of Seth Germadash, who was with him in Erwada Jail. He mentions that writing such autobiographies is a practice from the West, not at all in the Low Countries [4] and that he considered the idea of ​​a friend. Although his thoughts may change later on, he notes that he decided to write this book [5] with the intention of recording the trials he had done in his life with truth. He has clearly explained that in this book he wants to mention only about his spiritual and ethical experiments and does not want to mention about politics. In the first part, he writes about eating grass, smoking, drinking alcohol, handling, and then praying for these. [6] Two books had a great impact on him in his childhood and among them he read Arichandra's drama with great interest. He also mentions that he felt like Arichandra ""[7]. Isiravanan's play of parental affection and the devotion shown by Isiravanan to his parents in it affected him greatly [8] Gandhiji got married at the age of 13. Regarding this, he said, ""It is with great pain that I have to record here the news that I got married at the age of 13. .It is impossible to justify marriage at such an unbelievably young age"". In this section, Mr. Karamchand records that he was killed by nature. He also records in this section how he hated the exercise he had to receive in school.[9] Part Two Gandhi wanted to stay with his family, relatives, friends, and improve his relations with his wife, but because his work was not interesting, he accepted a job as a legal adviser to an Indian Mohammedan organization. His trip to South Africa was a temporary arrangement, and he considered it a substitute for the sluggishness of his career. After a long struggle between the British and the Dutch, Natal and the Cape Colony were claimed by the British and the Dutch who had already settled in South Africa came to the Orange Republic and Trench Wall respectively. The struggle with the British continued for independent poor countries and the white citizens who lived there. In order to suppress them, the British government followed a strict apartheid policy there. Because of this, mostly black people were subjected to great hardships. Indians living on sugarcane and coffee plantations were less affected than blacks. However, they were treated as second-class citizens. Gandhiji's suffering in South Africa and his struggle against oppression is well known. During his long stay here, he suffered many humiliations. The news [10] of his being thrown from a train in Maritsubusa became very popular. Gandhi was thrown from the train for refusing to get down from the first class based on his principles. After this, he experienced many difficulties in getting a place to stay in the canteen due to apartheid. It was also seen that Paddy had to accept many more injustices by his fellow Indians, who were mostly labourers. Although confused at first, the insults and humiliations he faced made him take a stand against apartheid. He rose to prominence as a public figure and figure among the Transvaal Indians. In his first speech there, he said that such inequality should not be accepted and everyone should unite, work hard, learn English and practice healthy habits. Although the work of a lawyer accepted by the Gandhis was heavy, he had the opportunity to read Tolstoy's books in his spare time. Tolstoy maintained a close correspondence with Gandhiji who was greatly impressed by his ideas of peace and justice. Both were congenial in the philosophy of non-violence. Gandhi's intense protest and anger against apartheid in South Africa strongly resonated in Tolstoy's social commentary. Both of them adopted as a guide the philosophy of self-denial for the people of the country which was preached by Jesus Christ in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. [Mohan Dasu Karamchand Gandhi | Gandhiji continued to depend on the Bhagavad Gita for his spiritual quest. As a result, he learned that the basis of his work was self-reliance and not self-denial. Gandhiji, who maintained that public life was a state of unconsciousness, refused to accept any payment for his services and depended on the income he earned from his legal profession for his livelihood. He did not rely only on religious texts for understanding and formulating theories about religions. Gandhi's friend Raichandra from Bombay was a religious fanatic. A well-versed spiritualist on many topics including Hinduism, Christianity. He will keep in touch with him and exchange ideas. Because of this he realized that inner honesty and clarity are important. Agashuthi believed that superiority was more important than the order to be observed on the outside, even on the baseless doctrines of religions. Therefore, even though he believed in the God of his religion, he believed that all religions present truths in their own way, and therefore it is appropriate to respect them. After his stint in South Africa, he found, as expected, reason for the Gandhis to stay. The Natal Legislature then attempted to enact the ""Indian Suffrage Act"" denying Indians the right to vote. There was no widespread awareness or opinion about this assembly case except for a few friends of Gandhiji. Friends requested Gandhiji to remain in South Africa and join them in protesting against the injustice being meted out to Indians. Indians were treated very lowly there and were called 'coolies'. He saw that apartheid was ingrained in the blood of the whites and particularly in the Dutch-ruled area where Indians lived in squalid urban slums and were not allowed to own or manage agricultural land. Even in Natal, where Indians have a slight influence, one cannot go out after 9 pm without a pass. In 'Cape Colony', another British-ruled place, Indians were also prohibited from walking on footpaths by the side of roads. The purpose of the 'Bill of Laws' was to give legal form to many such injustices. Although last-minute petitions could not prevent the introduction of the Indian Citizenship Act, the Gandhis urged the British Government's Secretary of State for Settlement, sent the petition, and published it in newspapers in South Africa, England, and India. Newspapers raised awareness of the plight of the South African Indian in all three countries, with the Times of India and the London Times editorializing the case for Indian suffrage. Gandhiji also established a political organization called the Natal Indian Congress, which held regular meetings. After some financial support, a library and regular discussions were organized. He published two pamphlets, A Plea to Every Englishman and A Plea for Suffrage to the Indian People, explaining the injustices of apartheid policies. Although initially Gandhiji was expected to stay in South Africa for a month or at most a year, he stayed in South Africa for about 20 years. Even though the first job he had accepted was over, he had started working for 20 new companies. Although his first job ended, his work for 20 new companies provided him with income, which provided him with a living. This also gave him time to engage in public life, and his struggle against apartheid and inequality in South Africa made him known as 'Uttamar'-'Mahatma' among Indians around the world. . Part Three In 1896, Gandhi left India for a while and returned to South Africa with his family. In India, he published a pamphlet called 'Green Pamphlet' explaining the ""plight of Indians in South Africa"". He realized how popular he was among the Indians and how much they appreciated his service. Many laborers in South Africa came from Madras Province to welcome Gandhiji in large numbers when he arrived in Chennai. Gandhiji along with his family returned to South Africa in December 1896. Gandhiji was very popular throughout South Africa. He arrived at the port of Natal on his way back to South Africa. A violent mob protested that he should not be allowed into Natal. The crowd mistakenly believed that all the non-whites from the ship carrying the Gandhis were brought by the Gandhis to settle in South Africa. But those who came with Gandhi were already living in Natal. Fortunately, the Gandhijis were on good terms with the British in South Africa, so the police superintendent of Natal port and his wife escorted the Gandhijis safely. After this event, the white people there began to think highly of him and respect him. Natal resumed his work in the Indian Congress. His goodwill towards the British helped him decide how to handle the Poowar War that ensued. Wanting to develop goodwill, they took part in the Battle of Poowar and served as Indian Medical Service with the volunteer force, even though they did not fight. Gandhi had an unshakable belief in the principles of equality and equality. As the British government also had these policies, he believed that the British government's constitution and government deserved the loyalty of all Indian citizens. He believed that apartheid in South Africa was not a permanent approach but a temporary arrangement. He thought that India also needed an English government and that it would do good for the public. The war between the British and the Dutch continued for three years. The British were victorious in a fierce battle and captured the Transvaal and Orange Pree. He believed that British victory would restore justice in South Africa and he could return home. He wanted to attend the conference of the Indian National Congress in 1901. He believed that the Indian National Congress would provide a political and social foundation for the middle class. Founded by an Englishman in 1885, the Congress had no political power. It took a 'supportive stance' to the government. Gandhi wanted to participate in the meeting and pass a resolution in favor of the South African Indians. Before leaving Natal, he returned home saying he would return to South Africa if necessary. The hope of the Gandhians who participated in the Congress conference in 1901 was not in vain. With the help of one of the important leaders, Gopala Krishna Gokhale, a resolution was passed in favor of the South African Indians. Gandhiji, Mr. Gokhale stayed at their residence for a month and met many leaders. This was very useful for Gandhiji later on. Gandhiji had to return to Natal as he had already promised. It was reported that the British and the Indians were friendly and united and working against the interests of the Indians, and that the British were planning to hand over the power to the whites living there, just like in Canada and Australia. The Gandhijis did not immediately return to South Africa and met Mr. Chamberlin, the Secretary of the British Government for Settlements, and pointed out the injustice to the Indians through a petition. It was reported that the Dutch and the British living there were the only people who deserved to rule South Africa. Gandhiji rallied against this new political arrangement. Instead of staying in Natal, he offered help to those returning from the war who had to stay in the Transvaal and who had to pay high prices for permit cards. He also helped those who were forced to vacate the houses they lived in and were forced to vacate them. She started the magazine ""Indian Opinion"" to spread the principles of political freedom and equal opportunities for Indians in South Africa. Many European women worked in the office of the magazine. Later many people from different parts of the country were involved in this work. It sought to raise Gandhiji's popularity and promote his policies. At the same time, he learned the book 'Theorem for Shops' written by Chan Rachkin. This book emphasized the principle that manual work is superior to all other types of work. This idea had a great influence on Gandhiji. Gandhi renounced all the customs, style, dress and manners of the upper country. He settled with his family in a farm house called 'Ponicus' in the Transvaal. He printed and published the Indian Opinion magazine by hand, avoiding the use of machines. He did farming by hand without the help of machines. He tried to implement the traditional values ​​of India without the influence of the western countries. He did not want to be influenced by the western countries like electricity and technology. He started implementing this policy on 8th September 1906. He asked a large number of Indians gathered in the Transvaal to pledge to carry out a non-cooperation movement. Then the South African government introduced a new rule requiring all Indians over the age of 8 to register their names. Gandhiji refused to register his name as a pioneer. Because of that he was brought before the judge and sentenced to jail and he said he was following the non-cooperation movement and asked for more punishment. Gandhi continued his propaganda. Thousands of Indians objected to their permit cards and entered the Transvaal without a permit card to express their protest and non-cooperation. In 1908 again many went to jail with Gandhiji. A South African commander, John Christian Sumatsu, then refused, saying he would relax the permit card rule. Gandhiji did not lose heart. In 1909, he went to London and gathered support there. As a result, in 1913, General Sumatsu canceled this rule. However, the Transvaal Prime Minister treated the Indians as second-class cottagers. At the same time the Cape Colony government passed a law making non-Christian marriages invalid. As a result, all Indian children were considered to be born out of wedlock. The Natal Government oppressed the Indians by imposing a heavy poll tax. In this way, Gandhiji led non-cooperation movement on a large scale against the Indian policy. Many women took part in this movement and crossed the Natal city border without permission. 5000 coal miners also went on strike. They crossed the Natal border to resist arrest under the leadership of Gandhiji. Thalapathy Sumatsh also had mutual respect for each other, even though they often had differences of opinion. As the majority of Indians protested, Sumitz also relented and accepted Indian marriages and abolished the poll tax. It was also announced that the bringing of people from India to work would be gradually reduced and would be stopped completely by 1920. In July 1914, Gandhiji was called 'Mahatma' and gained world fame due to the success of his non-cooperation movement. Part Four Gandhiji was in England when the First World War broke out. In South Africa he served in the First Aid Volunteer Corps as he served in the Boover War. He returned to the country after his health deteriorated and he was again given a rousing and enthusiastic welcome. Gandhiji was affectionately called 'Mahatma' by all. Although he humbly accepted the love and affection of the public, he used to say that everyone was equal and he did not want to accept being given a title and sanctification. Praying for humility and humility, he retreated from public life for a year and engaged in self-introspection to test his sanctity-healing. Apart from that, he established an ashram along with the untouchables and lived with them. He continued to lead an ascetic life despite the disapproval of his financiers and upper castes. He continued his ashram life with the financial help of a Mohammedan gentleman in an untouchable area of ​​Ahmedabad district. Eventually the ascetic life was accepted by others. Although withdrawn from public life, Gandhiji agreed to meet the Governor of Bombay Province and consult him before taking any political action. Mr. Wellington, who was then the Governor of Bombay, later held the post of Viceroy of India. Gopala Krishna Gokhale was deeply saddened by his demise. Gokhale has been a mentor and supporter of Gandhiji. Although many in the Indian National Congress embraced Indian nationalism, Gandhi stayed aloof. In 1915, he established a new residence called the Satyagraha Ashram near Ahmedabad, where he settled with his colleagues and an untouchable family. After a while, he felt that it was necessary to get freedom from the British, but he was afraid that in their place, wealthy Indians who had grown up in Western civilization would come to rule the country. He had a determined policy of achieving liberation with socio-economic revival, poverty-free, caste-religion-free society, without ups and downs. Gandhiji did not consider that India qualified for liberation until the poor had compassion and patronage for all. Resuming his public life in 1916, Gandhi explained his understanding of liberation and socio-economic revival while addressing the Kashi Hindu Polytechnic Association. He explained how poor the standard of living of the people was and what he had seen during his journey, especially the prevalence of unsanitary conditions. Although the upper castes did not agree with this view, Gandhiji decided to put his ideas into action. He spoke out for the poor agricultural workers in Champaran district against the arrests here as in South Africa. Due to his efforts, the government set up an inquiry committee against the exploitation of the plantation owners. Gandhiji was always vocal against violence. When the factory workers of Ahmedabad went on strike and resorted to violence, Nna kept the peace by fasting. Although some political observers criticized the hunger strike as a wrong approach, within three days the factory owners and workers had reached an agreement. Through this experiment, Gandhi realized that fasting is a powerful weapon. This later paid off for him immensely. When World War I broke out, Gandhi tried to recruit men for the British Army. His contemporaries, who had heard Gandhiji's passionate speeches on the Non-Cooperation Movement, were reluctant to accept his position. Although Gandhiji was loyal to the British government and committed to the principles and principles of the British government, he began to hold more and more on the principle of independence. Following this, the Gandhijis traveled across the country. Later, when his condition worsened, he followed his soil treatment and food ripening without taking any medicine. He had to stay bedridden in his ashram for some time. After the British conquered the 'Otama' empire, the world's most important Mohammedan kingdom, there was widespread unrest in India as well. Although the British claimed to have protected the small states and the people from the tyranny of the Ottoman government, the Indian people refused to believe this. Even after the end of the First World War, the British government decided to continue to enforce the special laws and regulations made for wartime without removing them. As a result of this curfew, many powers to restrict freedom of speech continued to remain in the hands of the government. A nationwide strike was held on 6th April 1919 following Gandhiji's request. Gandhi was arrested for this. In many places, the general public was involved in the protest. Violence also erupted against the wishes of Gandhiji. Gandhiji who did not accept violence called off the protest and appealed to everyone to return to their work. He opined that if the satyagraha could not be conducted without violence, it would be useless to continue it. Not all those involved in the protest agreed with Gandhiji's views. In Amritsar, the capital of Punjab province, the British government expelled Hindu and Mohammedan members of the Congress organization from the province. People gathered in the streets of the city and engaged in violence. The British government sent an officer named Brigadier General Reginald E. Dyer to restore law and order. Dyer banned all public gatherings and flogged people when the police approached. About 1000 citizens who did not care about this gathered in the center of Amritsar city. Dyer opened fire on them without any warning. The people who were trapped in the cramped place were lying on the ground with no way out. But the police, accepting the offer of tires, fired at the people who were lying on the ground until they ran out of bullets. Hundreds died and many were injured. This shooting event came to be known as the Amritsar Massacre. This angered the British as well as the Indians. The British authorities in London condemned the event and ordered Dyer to be fired. The massacre had a great impact on the Indian people. Moderates also took up the argument that Indian independence was the solution. After the assassination, Gandhiji was allowed to go to Amritsar to conduct an investigation. When Gandhiji gave his investigation report, many more politicians contacted him. They also decided that independence from the British government was the only solution. After the Amritsar event Gandhiji participated in the Mohammedan meeting held in Delhi. At the meeting, the Mohammedans expressed concern over British suppression of the Caliphate of Turkey. The Mohammedans regarded the caliphs as the successors of Mohammed. The British explained that such action was necessary to maintain peace after the First World War, but the Mohammedans did not accept this argument. Gandhiji also advised not to accept the action of the British. Gandhiji urged Indian Muslims to engage in satyagraha and refuse government jobs and taxes if the British continued to try to suppress the caliphs. Although England and Turkey were engaged in peace negotiations, Gandhi advised them to remain calm and cautious. Unlike other nationalist politicians, Gandhi supported the Montague Semester Board recommendations. These recommendations led to the formation of local bodies. Ultimately, because of Gandhiji's pride and the idea that the Congress could not achieve anything great without him, politicians with alternative views also agreed with him. The British were serious about ending the Muslim Ghalib issue, as were the implementation of the Relalam Act, which was the basis of the Oppressive Act. Disheartened by this, in 1920, Gandhi prayed to the people of the country to give up their national clothes and government jobs and intensify the non-cooperation movement. As a pioneer, he returned the awards and medals he had received for his services in the Boer War in South Africa. By assuming the responsibility of being the first leader of the independence movement, he made it clear to all that freedom was the solution for India. In September 1920, Gandhi handed over the Constitution and Constitution to the Congress. Accordingly, both groups at the national level paved the way to mobilize support for the Non-Cooperation Movement by forming several groups. Gandhiji and other leaders traveled across the country to strengthen these basic structures. It was a huge success. After the great popularity of Gandhiji, the British Viceroy Lord Reading did not tend to take any action against him. In 1922, Gandhi wanted the non-cooperation movement to evolve into a civil disobedience movement. Following the murder of British officers by a violent mob in the town of Charisari, Lord Reading ordered the arrest of the Gandhis. Gandhiji, who never accepted violence, condemned the Charisari event and went on a fast and prayed. But the British continued to make arrests, believing that this would incite violence. Part Five The British charged the Gandhis with treason and sentenced them to six years in prison. This is the first time such charges have been made in India. Judge Broomfield, well aware of Gandhiji's reputation, was reluctant to impose a harsh sentence. He came to the conclusion that Gandhiji was guilty of the crime. Gandhiji pleaded guilty to the crime and asked for severe punishment. Confessing the crime and serving the sentence was in accordance with his satyagraha policy. He also believed that serving the sentence would strengthen his commitment to his principles. In the prison, the authorities allowed him to keep a bed and read books. He wrote his autobiography while in this prison. While the Gandhis were in prison, Indians returned to their government work as usual. And against the wishes of the Gandhis, the enmity between the Hindus and the Mohammedans intensified. There was violence in many places. Due to disunity among themselves, the liberation struggle was greatly hampered. Disunity was widespread on the basis of caste and religion. Gandhiji believed that the British had lost the morale to continue ruling, but he did not want India to become independent by weakening the British government. He thought that Indians should have the moral authority to get freedom. Gandhiji advised about obedience, modesty, good behavior, refusal of child marriage, etc. Gandhiji has admitted that he has changed his status several times in various programs such as child marriage. He also says that he could not follow the right moral path all the time. After the imprisonment, he continued his truth test. He concludes his autobiography by saying that he continued to do many experiments based on the insatiable curiosity contained in his soul. He ends by saying that his aim is to control his desires and senses and follow this difficult path, set an example for others and achieve the glory of the house. He concludes by saying that his life is not an autobiography, it is a collection of experiments in his life. Gandhiji in his book 'The Kingdom of God is with in you' by Leo Dalchtai, 'Unto this Last' by Chan Irach and poet Shrimad Rajchandra ) records that communication had a profound effect on his life.

"India or officially the Republic of India) is a country located in South Asia. It is the 7th largest country in the world by area, the 2nd most populous country (1.2 billion people) and the most populous democracy. Surrounded by the Indian Ocean to the south, the Arabian Sea to the west, and the Bay of Bengal to the east, it is bordered by Pakistan to the west, Bhutan to the north, People's Republic of China, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. Sri Lanka and Maldives are located near the Indian Ocean. It shares maritime borders with the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a union of India, Thailand, and Sumatra, Indonesia.[19] India is the seventh largest country by area. India has a total coastline of 7,517 km (4,700 mi).[20] According to the 2011 census, India has the second largest population in the world with a population of 1.21 billion.[21] It ranks fourth in terms of purchasing power parity in the economy. India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. The Indus Valley Civilization or the Harappa-Mohanchadaro Civilization originated here. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism emerged as four major religions in India. Conquered by European countries in the seventeenth century, it was liberated on August 15, 1947. Later in 1950, it was declared a republic on January 26 and became the largest republic in the world. History A 40,000-year-old Paleolithic rock-painting tradition, such as the Sanchi Stupa in the state of Madhya Pradesh, built by Ashoka around 300 BC, has been found at Bhimpetka in central India and elsewhere. In South Asia, the first permanent settlements appeared around 9000 years ago. The culture of this region developed into the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, which peaked between 6000 BC and 1900 BC. Around 1500 BC, it is believed that the Vedic culture originated from the influx of Aryan ethnic groups from northwest India, partly due to admixture with the local inhabitants. This theory suggests that the culture, language and religion of the Aryans became dominant in the country over time. In the earlier, broader sense, this influx was a sudden, violent migration. However, recent thinking seems to favor the idea that it may have been a gradual introduction. (See Aryan Occupy Theory). that no sect came from the northwest and that the Indus Valley Civilization and the Vedic Civilization were one. Another view is that the Indus Valley Civilization and the Southerners from the Sunken Kumari Continent mentioned in the Tamil Sangam literature are the ancestors of today's Indians. However, none of these ideas have been fully and definitively verified. There are many differences of opinion among researchers about this. The reign of the Guptas, which began in the third century, is known as the Golden Age of ancient India. The Chera, Chola, Pandya, Pallava, Chalukya and Kadamba empires ruled South India at various times. The arrival of the Arabs began in the eighth century. The Turks started arriving in the 12th century. They were followed by European traders in the late 15th century. With the subjugation of the Mughal Empire, in the 19th century, political control of almost all of India passed to the British Empire. The non-violent struggle led by Mohan Das Karamchand Gandhi against British imperialism led to India's independence in 1947. The Indian subcontinent was divided into secular India and Islamic Pakistan. Then on January 26, 1950, India became a republic. After a civil war broke out in 1971 between the non-contiguous land areas of West and East Pakistan, East Pakistan seceded into the autonomous state of Bangladesh following Indian intervention. After the liberalization implemented in 1991, the Indian economy began to grow rapidly. Natural resources, human resources and conservation-friendly land structure are some of India's leading strengths. The Kashmir issue with Pakistan, alarming population growth, environmental degradation and corruption are some of the challenges facing India. See also: Indian History Timeline Political Structure India is a federation of 29 states and 7 union territories. The Federation is energetically declared to be the Independent Society of India as a Secular Democratic Republic. Government of India is maintained by three components namely Legislative Assembly, Executive Assembly and Independent Judiciary. These are structured along the lines of British administrative systems to monitor the actions of others, misuse of power and corruption while collectively, each component. The President of India is the head of state, but his duties are largely based on traditional rituals. The President and the Vice President are elected every five years by the members of the Parliament and the State and Country Assemblies (under the Irawa system). Executive power rests with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet under his leadership. The President appoints the leader of the party or coalition with the majority in Parliament as Prime Minister. The President approves other Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Parliament of India consists of two houses. They are Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. Both of these are created under the Constitution of India. The Cabinet is accountable to the Parliament, more specifically the Lok Sabha. The 233 members of the Rajya Sabha are elected by the state and national legislatures. Another 12 members are appointed by the President. They will serve for six years. One-third of the Rajya Sabha members will have to go for election every two years. The Constitution of India provides that the Indian Lok Sabha can have a maximum of 552 members.[22] Out of which 530 members can be elected from states and 20 members from union territories. The President may also appoint two Anglo-Indians if he so desires. Thus, a maximum of 552 members can be elected to the Lok Sabha of India. But currently 13 members are elected from Madhya Pradesh constituencies. Thus the present members of the Lok Sabha are 545. Lok Sabha elections are held every five years. Supreme Court is the supreme authority of Indian legal structure. The High Court acts as the guardian of the Constitution. The High Court has jurisdiction over disputes between the States and the Central Government. Further appeals lie to the High Courts. There are 18 High Courts in common for large states and one for small states. Next to that are the District Courts. In all these the decision of the High Court is final. Politics India has a multi-party system of government, so there are numerous parties. These are recognized by the Election Commission of India in two categories namely national parties and state parties based on certain criteria. Since India's independence, the Indian National Congress has largely dominated the Centre. Various state parties are influential at the state level. Other major national parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and the Janata Dal. Barring two brief periods, the Indian Congress was the majority party in Parliament throughout the period from 1950 to 1990. The Congress lost the parliamentary elections in 1977 due to popular dissatisfaction with the Emergency Act imposed during the pre-1977 Congress government. The National Front, formed by the Janata Party and some other parties including the Left, defeated the Congress and came to power. However, this coalition could not rule for long. The government was overthrown within two years. The period between 1996 and 1998 was a tumultuous period for the Central Government. During this period, first the Bharatiya Janata Party and then for a few months a multi-party alliance called the United Front ruled the government. In the subsequent elections held in 1998, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance came to power. This government also earned the distinction of being the first non-Congress government to hold office for the entire five-year term of Parliament. Neither party got an absolute majority in the 2004 general elections. However, the Congress party, which had the largest number of members in the parliament, came to power on behalf of the United Progressive Alliance, which was formed by the Left and other state parties. This is the first coalition government formed by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party won the 2014 Lok Sabha general election and took over the government with a single majority. Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister. Foreign Affairs and Military Since independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most other countries. In the 1950s, there was a voice for the liberation of Asian African colonial countries from the grip of European countries. India is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement. After the Sino-Indian War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, India tried to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union. As a result, relations with the United States were affected. This situation lasted until the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. India and Pakistan fought three wars, mainly over the Kashmir dispute. More than these, there have been small skirmishes from time to time. In particular, the Siachen Ice War in 1984 and the Kargil War in 1999 can be mentioned. In recent times, India has been making important contributions to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). India, a staunch supporter of the United Nations and a founding member, has deployed more than 55,000 soldiers and police personnel to serve on four continents in its peacekeeping operations. However, it has refused to sign agreements such as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty due to its desire to maintain its sovereignty over nuclear programs despite facing many criticisms and restrictions related to military requirements. India's recent activities have seen it improve relations with the United States, China, and Pakistan. Economically, India has close ties with other developing countries in the continents of Asia, South America and Africa. India has the third largest army in the world. Army, Navy and Air Force are functioning of the Indian Defense Department for the defense of India. Along with these, the Border Security Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Force, Central Semkha Police Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Coast Guard are functioning under the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces. India became a nuclear power with its first nuclear test in 1974, Operation Smiling Buddha, followed by ""underground tests"" in 1998. Following the raid in 1998, the world banned the provision of military supplies to India. However, these were gradually withdrawn. India maintains a policy of non-nuclear first use. States and Territories India is a federal republic. It includes 29 states and 7 union territories. All states and the union territories of Puducherry and the national capital, Delhi, have governments elected by the people. Other Union Territories are under the direct rule of the President, with Lieutenant Governors appointed by the Central Government. In 1956, linguistic states were created under the States Reorganization Act. Since then, except for the creation of some new states in northern parts of India, the system has continued without much change. States and Union Territories are divided into smaller administrative units. These are called districts. There are approximately 600 districts in India. Of the seven Union Territories, only Puducherry and Delhi have the right to constitute elected legislatures like other states under a special provision[23] of the Constitution of India. According to Article 370 of the Constitution of India, only the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been granted certain special privileges on a temporary basis.[24] Geography. India is the seventh largest country in the world by area. Part of the Indian subcontinent, India is geographically divided into three sub-regions. They are the Himalayan ranges to the north (highest peak Kanchansunga 8,598 m), the Indus-Gangetic Plain (the Thar Desert to the west) and the Deccan Plateau. The Deccan Plateau is bounded in three directions by the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Indian Ocean to the south and the Arabian Sea to the west. Among the rivers that originate in the Himalayas and flow into India, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra are important. Both of these flow into the Bay of Bengal. Yamuna and Kosi are tributaries of river Ganga. The area through which the Kosi flows has very little slope, causing devastating floods every year. Rivers such as Godavari, Mahanadi, Cauvery and Krishna flowing in the island region are situated in a sloping area, so the risk of flooding is less. These rivers also flow into the Bay of Bengal. Major rivers like Narmada and Thabi flow into the Arabian Sea along the west coast of India. The Indus River is the reason behind the name India. There are two archipelagos within Indian territory. The atoll islands of Lakshadweep lie off the west coast of the Indian archipelago, and the volcanic chain of the Andaman-Nicobar archipelago lies off the east coast in the Andaman Sea. The climate of India is hot monsoon in the south, sub-tropical in the north and various intermediate climates in the rest of the region. India's coastline is 7,517 kilometers (4,671 miles) long. Of this, 5,423 kilometers (3,370 mi) belong to the Indian Archipelago and 2,094 km (1,301 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. Of the shores belonging to the Indian mainland, 43% are sandy, 11% are rocky and 46% are mud flats or swamps. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal have maritime borders. Major and minor ports are located along the coasts of these states. Many of these are naturally formed harbours. India's Flora and Fauna Resources Situated within the Indo-Malayan climate zone, India has remarkable biological diversity. It is one of the 18 most diverse countries. Compared to the total species in the world, 7.6% of mammal species, 12.6% of bird species, 6.2% of reptiles, 4.4% of amphibians, 11.7% of fish and 6.0% of flowering plants are found in India. Many ecosystems here, such as the Solak forests, have a high percentage of endemic species. About 33 percent of India's forest flora is endemic. The forests of India range from the tropical rainforests of the Andaman, Western Ghats, and northeastern India to the coniferous forests of the Himalayas. Between these ranges are the moist deciduous forests of eastern India, dominated by acha trees, the deciduous forests of central and southern India, dominated by teak, and the scrub forests of central Deccan and the western Ganga plains, dominated by oak trees. Among the important Indian plants, neem, which is used in folk medicine for medicinal purposes, is found on the seals of Mohenjo Daro and is the royal tree that Buddha received knowledge from. Many Indian plant and animal species are descended from species that originated in Gondwana, the Indian subcontinent. Later, when the Indian subcontinent moved and collided with the Laurasian tectonic plate, large numbers of species were displaced. However, volcanic eruptions and climate changes that occurred 20 million years ago wiped out most of the species native to India. After this, mammals entered India from Asian regions through passes in the animal kingdom on either side of the emerging Himalayas. In conclusion, among Indian species, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic to India. This is very less compared to 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians belonging to India. Notable local species are Trachypithecus johnii and Bufo beddomii. India has 2.9% of the species listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. These include the Asiatic lion and the Bengal tiger. In recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to wildlife. Thus, the country parks were first established in 1935 and later expanded. In 1972, the Wildlife Protection Act was enacted in India. India has more than five hundred reserves, 13 biosphere reserves and 25 wetlands registered under the Ramsar Convention. Economy For most of the post-independence period, India followed a socialist approach with tight government controls on private enterprise, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment. However, since 1991, economic reforms have gradually opened up its markets and loosened restrictions on foreign trade and investment. Budgetary deficits of central and state governments have declined and foreign exchange reserves have increased from US$ 5.8 billion in March 1991 to US$ 308 billion in July 2008. Amid various political controversies, privatization of state-owned enterprises and the opening of certain sectors to private and foreign participation continue. The Indian economy consists of traditional agriculture, modern agriculture, handicrafts, many new industries and many ancillary services including software. As of 2003, software exports alone were around $1000 million. However, a quarter of the population lives in poverty without proper food. India's foreign exchange reserves and currency were in very good shape in 2001 and subsequent years. India's GDP has reached $1.089 trillion. It ranks fourth in the world at $4.726 trillion ($2,66,000 crore) in terms of purchasing power parity. India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world with an average GDP growth of 5.5% over the last two decades. At 516.3 million, India's labor force is the second largest in the world. 60 percent of them are engaged in agriculture or related industries. 28 percent work in service industries or related sectors and 12 percent work in industries. India's primary agricultural crops are rice, oilseeds, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes. Agriculture sector contributes 28% of GDP. Services and Industry contribute 54% and 18% respectively. Important industries include petroleum, cement, chemicals, consumer electronics, food processing, machinery, mining, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, steel, transportation equipment, and apparel. Along with the rapidly growing economy, the demand for energy is also increasing. According to calculations by the Energy Information Administration, India ranks sixth in oil consumption and third in coal consumption. Poverty Level India is a developing country. However, 350–400 million people live below the poverty line. According to the World Bank's Global Development Index, 35% of Indians live on an income of $1. Basic food, shelter, education and medical facilities for them are very less. Also, 40% of people can neither read nor write. India's economic distribution is highly unequal. In particular, the disparity in economic status between the Dalits, the oppressed and the rest, the urban dwellers and the rural dwellers is seen to be very large. Population According to the 2011 census, the population of India is 121 crore 19 lakh three thousand four hundred and twenty two (1,210,193,422). The population has grown at a rate of 17.70% over the last decade (2001–2011).[26] Uttar Pradesh has the highest population (199,812,341) and Sikkim has the lowest population (610,577). The literacy rate has risen to 74.04% (male 82.14%; female 65.46%). [27] time According to the 2011 Census, the population growth rate of Hindus decreased by 0.7% to 96.63 crore (79.08%), out of India's total population of 121.09 crore, according to the Population Census of India on 27 August 2015[28][29][30]. The population growth rate increased by 0.8% to 17.22 crore (14.2%)[31][32][33][34][35], with Christians at 2.78 crore (2.3%), Sikhs at 2.08 crore (1.7%), Jains at 45 100,000 (0.4%), the population of Buddhists is reported to be 84 lakhs (0.8%), and the non-religious population is 29 lakhs (0.4%).[36][37] For the first time the category ""non-specified"" was included in the 2011 census.[38][39] Disparity in population growth rate by religion According to the above table, the population growth rate of Hindus which was 84.1% in 1951 has gradually declined by 4.30% in 60 years and has come down to 79.80% in 2011. At the same time, the population of Muslims, which was 9.8% in 1951, gradually grew by 4.40% and rose to 14.23% in 2011. In other cases, population growth has not fluctuated much. States where Hindus are a minority Muslims constitute the majority community in the state of Jammu and Kashmir and the Union Territory of Lakhsati. In four states, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya, Christians form the majority community. Sikhs are the majority population in the state of Punjab. [40] In states where Hindus are the majority, minority Hindus are not given minority status by the Indian government. Reservation of seats in educational institutions and educational assistance to the minority Hindus of these states by the Government of India; Continued denial by state governments. Language India is home to two major language families. They belong to the Indo-Aryan language family, spoken by 74% of the population, and the Dravidian language family, spoken by 24% of the population. Other languages ​​spoken in India belong to the Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman language families. Neither the Indian Constitution nor Indian laws describe any language as a national language.[41] With the largest number of speakers[42], Hindi is the official language of the Indian government.[43] English has become the official language and is widely used in workplaces and administration. [44] English plays a major role in education in India, especially in higher education (Department of Higher Education (India)). In addition, each state has for itself the language widely spoken in its respective states as the official language. The Constitution of India recognizes 21 languages. Tamil was the first Indian language to qualify as a classical language. Following Tamil, Sanskrit (2005), Telugu (2008), Kannada (2008), Malayalam (2013), and Odia (2014) were declared classical languages ​​by the Government of India. India has automatically defined the definition of classical language without using the traditional definition of classical language Social Structure The caste system is the foundation of the social power hierarchy of the Indian social structure. The caste structure is made up of elements based on birth, occupation, economy and religion. The origins of this system can be traced to the ""four varna"" caste major divisions emphasized in the Vedas. There are thousands of subdivisions within them. The degree of disparity between them varies from region to region. Caste-based discrimination and inequality arose in society in medieval times due to a misunderstanding of the caste norms mentioned in the Vedas. Currently there are many laws against caste-based oppression. Apart from this, there is reservation for the lower classes in education and employment. However, caste plays an important role in the political life of this country and in many social customs including marriage. The social status of women in India has never been equal. Women have been neglected or hindered in politics, career opportunity, education and economic role. Female infanticide, child marriage, chastity, cohabitation, refusal to remarry, refusal to divorce, refusal to own property, slavery, devadasi system are denied the rights of women. It cannot even be said that legally women's rights are protected because India has a religion-based civil law. However, there is a paradox in India's history that is unlike any other country. That is, women are worshiped as deities, women are recognized as Shiva's right half and Shakti. Moreover, women are also taking place as the personality leaders of modern India. Indira Gandhi, Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee are good examples. It cannot be said that the status of women is the same in all parts of India. Especially in the state of Kerala, the rights of women are well maintained. The status of women has improved significantly in recent times. The growth of the telecommunications sector and the subsequent growth of the Indian economy have provided many opportunities for women. Culture Indian culture is one of the main cultural sources of the world. Indian culture is emerging by absorbing many ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural influences. This culture has many elements like high, complex, diverse music, dance and literature. Indian culture has many levels of character, expression and depth. What follows is a summary. Carnatic music and Hindustani music are the two main classical music traditions. Carnatic music originated in the south and Hindustani music in the north. Hindustani music is a tradition that has absorbed influences from Islamic music. Apart from these, there are many other musical traditions and expressions like Natar music, Tamil music. Indian dance has many dance expressions like Bharata Natyam, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathak, Kathakali. Stories are also told through dance. Apart from these there are folk art dances and puppet dances. Musical instruments expressive of music include veena, lyre, flute, tambura, mridhangam, nathaswaram, mattalam, davil, aguli, urumi, murasu, tamukku, bombai, kanjira, five-faced muvvam, kodukotti (or) kitidikitti, kombu, tarai, conch, mukaveena, trumpet. and rhythm are the primary ones. India has some of the most important literary creations in the world. Literary expressions of many major world languages ​​such as Sanskrit, Tamil, Bengali and Urdu are evident in India's cultural mix. Indian literature is manifested in many aspects like Vedas, Vedanta, Agamas, Buddhist works, Kappiyam (Ramayana, Mahabharata), Tamil Sangam literature, five great Tamil Kappiyams. Celebrations are an integral part of Indian culture and life. There are many celebrations like Pongal, Diwali, Navratri. Indian Independence Day and Mahatma Gandhi's birthday are also important national celebrations. Also, there are many celebrations centered on individual life events. Ancient India excelled in science. Aryabhatta and Bhaskar were the prominent scholars who studied the motions of the planets. The most commonly used mathematical numerals today are the Hindu-Arabic numerals. It is said that the number 0 was used for the first time in India. Saree, vedi, kurta, salwar kameez etc. are the traditional clothes in India. Rice and wheat play an important role in Indian cuisine. Thali, Idli, Dosa, Chapati are some of the foods commonly consumed by Indians. Movies are one of the main pastimes of Indians. Hindi, Tamil and Telugu films are preferred for their entertainment elements and Bengali and Malayalam films for their artistic elegance. Although some significant cultural differences can be found in every part of India, there is an increasing trend of cultural mixing across state and language boundaries. One of the major factors in this phenomenon is the proliferation of mass communication devices. Globalization and economic liberalization since the 1990s have significantly dominated Indian culture. Modern Indian music, films, dramas, media, languages, business practices, daily life style, workplace behavior patterns, male-female friendships/relationships have started to incorporate English words, upper country ideas and attitudes. Although it has undergone many changes over different periods, the main elements of Indian culture such as tolerance, hospitality, value for family ties and unity in diversity are still undiluted.

It contributes 6.23 percent to the country's gross national product and accounts for 8.78% of total employment. It has over 5 million foreign tourist arrivals and 562 million domestic tourist arrivals[45] annually. The tourism industry in India generated around US$ 100 billion in 2008. The sector is also expected to generate US$275.5 billion in 2018 at an annual growth rate of 9.4%.[46] The Ministry of Tourism is the coordinating agency for the development and promotion of tourism in India. It also continues the """" campaign. Tourist buses The Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation and Indian Railways, [47] have introduced several tourism schemes to attract domestic and foreign tourists. To attract foreign tourists Modern luxury trains with names such as Palace on Wheels [48], Maharaja Express, Royal Orient Express, Deccan Odyssey, Royal, Rashatan on Wheels and Golden Chariot (Golden Chariot), Deccan Odyssey, Buddhist Express travel around North India and the cultural destinations of South and East India. Special luxury coaches are operated from Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation operates special trains called Bharat Darshan across India to provide access to India's top tourist destinations at low fares.[49] Sports The national sport in India is Hockey India, which is managed by Hockey India. The Indian hockey team won 8 gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze medals at the 1975 Hockey World Cup and Olympic Games, becoming the most successful hockey team in the world. However, batting is the most popular sport among the Dham people.[50] The Indian cricket team has won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, the 2011 Cricket World Cup and the 2007 ICC World Twenty Over Cup, as well as shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka. The game of batting in India is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Domestic competitions like Ranjik Cup, Duleep Cup, Irani Cup and NKB It also administers the Salve Challenger Cup. Along with these, BCCI is also conducting a twenty over batting tournament called Indian Premier League. India is the origin and home of various traditional sports. They are Kabaddi, Sadugudu, Bekelwani, and Gilli Thanda. Early forms of Indian heroic sports such as martial arts, wrestling, Silambatam and Varmakala originated in India. Both the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award and the Arjuna Award are the highest sports awards in India. Similarly, the Dronacharya Award is the highest award given by the Government of India to sports coaches. Considered to have originated in India, chess is resurging as a popular sport with a growing number of successful players known as Indian Grandmasters.[51] The game of tennis is also popularized by the success of the Indian Davis Cup team and various tennis players.[52] India has a solid lead in shooting, having won various gold medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[53] In addition to these, Indian sportspersons have won many medals and awards at the international level in badminton[54], boxing[55] and wrestling[56][57]. Football is a popular sport in North East India, West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.[58] Holidays There are four national holidays in India. They are: Liberation Day (August 15) Republic Day (January 26) Gandhi's Birthday (October 2) There are also local holidays for celebrations other than Labor Day (May 1).

"An encyclopedia[1] is a collection of knowledge in written form. Encyclopaedias may be multidisciplinary, specialized to a particular field, or to a particular geographic area or ethnicity.[2] The information in the encyclopedia is organized alphabetically and by department. Alphabetical encyclopedias are the most commonly used.[3] Social Leadership Denis Diderot, who published an encyclopedia in French in the late 18th century, said the following about the encyclopedia: The purpose of an encyclopedia is to store and compile the vast knowledge of the world for the benefit of the people and to hand it down to the generations that follow us. This will prevent the work of previous centuries from becoming useless to future generations and will help our younger generation to be well educated and live happily. Also, before we die, this will be the charity we do for the mankind that will live in the future.—Diderot[4] Nature Today's encyclopedias evolved from 18th-century encyclopedias. Alphabets usually give words and their meanings. Also, sometimes the backgrounds of the words and other related information are included to a lesser extent. Even when the meaning of the term is given, users are not provided with information about its complete definition, specificity, scope of application, and how the term relates to the wider field of knowledge. Keeping the above requirements in mind, encyclopedias take up each topic and try to provide in-depth information about it and compile all the available knowledge in the field. Encyclopaedias also include maps, charts, appendices, and infographics. In the past, encyclopedias and encyclopedias were written by experts in the fields they covered. Four main elements define an encyclopedia. They are: Content, Boundary, Regulating Method, Formative Method. Encyclopedias can be generic. These contain articles on topics within each discipline (eg: Encyclopaedia Britannica). Encyclopaedias tend to focus only on topics that fall within a specific field. These are medical encyclopedias, philosophical encyclopedias and jurisprudential encyclopedias. The depth and breadth of the constructs covered will depend on the nature of their users. Encyclopaedias must be organized in a formal order if they are to be a valid source of evidence. In the past, printed encyclopedias were organized in one of two main ways. These are alphabetical system, hierarchical system of categories. The first method is the most commonly used method today. Especially public encyclopedias are organized in this way. Today's electronic media provide facilities for organizing content in multiple ways at the same time. Also, electronic media provide facilities such as search facilities and connectivity facilities that were never seen before. Nowadays, the development of multimedia and information technology has had a huge impact on the collection, verification, integration and disclosure of various types of information. Examples of new forms of encyclopedias are Everything2, Encarta, H2G2, Wikipedia, etc., which are designed for easy access to information. Some of the works labeled as akaramudhis actually resemble encyclopedias. Specially, there are special alphabets for specific fields like this. For example, Dictionary of the Middle Ages in English, Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Black's Law Dictionary. History Naturalis Historia (Naturalis Historia), a Latin work written by Pliny the Elder, a Roman statesman who lived in the first century AD, is the oldest encyclopedic work available today. He compiled a book with 37 chapters on natural history, art and architecture, medicine, geography, geology, etc. He states in his preface that he has compiled 20,000 notes from 2,000 different works written by 100 authors, including many from his own research. It was published in 77 AD. This particular structure is large and elaborate. It may have been a complete collection of all the sciences and arts related to nature. Pliny said: My topic is the natural world or life. A very underrated field. It is regrettable to use vulgar words or foreign barbarous words. Also, the path to this is not already paved by writers or anyone willing to go down this path. None of us has attempted this, nor has a single Greek dealt with all the branches of this subject alone. Although there were many similar older works, this is the only book that survived the Dark Ages. It was very popular during Roman times. Many stages of this were developed and spread throughout Europe. It was published in 1469 as one of the first classical period books to be printed. Since then it has been known as a reference book for information about the Roman period. Especially, it is known for fur art, fur technology, fur engineering, etc.; It was also a much sought after book for information related to fields like medicine, mineralogy, zoology, botany, geology etc. Early Middle Ages Saint Isidore of Seville, a great scholar, produced the first medieval encyclopedia, Etymologiae - 630 AD. In this he compiled information related to all the fields of knowledge, old and new, of his time. It consisted of 448 sections in 20 blocks. This collection is valuable not only for its uniqueness but also for the quotations from other authors and excerpts from their works. If he had not compiled this, information about many rare books would not be available today. The Encyclopaedia of Bartholomew Anglicanus in 1240 was the most widely read encyclopedia of the Middle Ages. However, in the later Middle Ages, around 1260, the encyclopedia by Vincent was said to contain 3 million words. The early Islamic and Persian anthologies of Muslim knowledge included many elaborate works and saw major developments in the fields known today as scientific method, historical method, and citation. By 960 AD, the Brethren of Purity from Pasura were engaged in the creation of the Brethren of Purity Encyclopaedia. Among these, Abu Bakr al-Razi's Encyclopaedia of Science, 270 books by Mu'tazilite al-Kindi, and Ibn China's Medical Encyclopaedia are notable. China The Four Great Books of Song, an encyclopedic work compiled during the beginning of the Song Dynasty in the 11th century, is a massive intellectual work of the time. The last of these contains 9.4 million Chinese characters in 1000 volumes. Many encyclopedic authors can be found throughout Chinese history. Among them were the scholar and statesman Shen Guo (1031–1095); Wang Chen (1290–1333), statesman, inventor, and agronomist; Notables include Chong Yinxiang (1587–1666). Yongle, a Chinese emperor of the Ming Dynasty, compiled an art encyclopedia called the Yongle Encyclopedia. Compiled in 1408, it is one of the largest encyclopedias in the world. It contains 11,000 handwritten volumes and 370 million Chinese characters. 17th – 19th centuries The modern idea of ​​a general purpose and widely used encyclopedia predates the 18th century encyclopedias. However, Chambers' Cyclopaedia or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (1728), Diderot and D'Alembert's Encyclopédie (1751), Encyclopaedia Britannica, Conversations-Lexikon were the first encyclopedias in the form of today. They were structured, with broad headings and in-depth explanations. The encyclopedia of the French Renaissance was based on the premise that it did not need to cover everything known to man, but only what was necessary. As what is necessary is decided on the basis of several criteria, encyclopedias of different sizes have emerged. The metrics were mostly based on morals. Encyclopaedists faced several problems with this approach. Such problems included how to decide what not to include, how to organize knowledge that could not be contained within the framework, how to handle newly discovered knowledge, and the impact it might have on the previous system. Sir Thomas Browne, a physician and philosopher from England, published an encyclopedia called Pseudodoxia Epidemica in 1646. He organized his encyclopedia in a hierarchical system known as the ""gradation of works"", which was widely used in the Renaissance. Accordingly, the topics were arranged from bottom to top in the order of Mineral, Vegetable, Animal, Man, Planets, Cosmos. Brown's collection saw five editions. Each edition was revised and new information was added. The last edition appeared in 1672. Found in the homes of educated Europeans in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, it was translated into many languages. It was John Harris who introduced the most familiar alphabetical arrangement system today. His work, published in 1704, was entitled Lexicon Technicum, or an English Alphabet of Arts and Sciences: Explaining the Arts, Not Only the Words Related to the Arts. (Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves). As mentioned in the title, the book contained not only terms related to arts and sciences but also explanations of arts and sciences. Sir Isaac Newton's only published work on chemistry is in the 1710 edition. It prioritized science as leadership. Its contents covered what was understood as ""science"" in the 18th century, as well as topics in the arts and fine arts. For example, there were up to 1200 pages on disciplinary topics like law, business, music etc. It can be considered more of an encyclopedia than an encyclopedia.

"Radium is a radioactive element with the atomic formula Ra. Its atomic number is 88. Its atomic mass is 226. Radium is the sixth element in column 2 of the periodic table. It is also classified as an alkaline metal. Pure radium is white in color like silver. But when exposed to air, radium readily reacts with nitrogen instead of oxygen to form a black surface layer called radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive. Among these, the most stable isotope is radium-226. Its half-life is 1600 years. This isotope decays radioactively into radon gas, specifically the isotope radon-222. Ionizing radiation is a byproduct when radium decays. It oxidizes the luminescent chemicals and produces radioluminescence. Radium in the form of radium chloride was discovered in 1898 by Maricuri and Pierrecuri. Radium was isolated from the mineral uranite at the French Academy of Sciences and published five days later. Marie Curie and Anne-Louis DePierre produced radium in its metallic state in 1911 by electrolysis of radium chloride.[1] In nature, radium is found in trace amounts in the minerals uranium and thorium. Radium is not an essential requirement for living organisms. Due to its radioactive and chemical reactivity, adverse health effects may occur when combined with biochemical processes. Radium has no commercial uses other than nuclear medicine. Earlier it was used as a radiation source for radiation devices. It is also considered a decongestant and has been used in radiopharmaceuticals. Radium is not used for such applications today. Because the toxicity of radium is realized today. So less toxic isotopes are used in these devices. Radium is the heaviest of the alkaline earth metals whose properties are known. And it is the only radioactive metal in that group. The physical and chemical properties of radium are similar to those of the element barium. Pure radium is a volatile element. It is white like silver, although calcium, isudrontium, and barium, which are considered to be its light co-elements, have a slight yellow tint. Its color fades quickly in air. Radium nitride reacts with air to form a black film on its surface. The melting point of radium can be either 700°C or 960°C. And its boiling point is 1737 degrees Celsius. Both of these quantities are smaller than barium. These quantities are also subject to periodic trends in the periodic table[2]. The elements of Group 2 show the same trend as we go from top to bottom of the table. Like barium and the alkali metals, radium crystallizes in a material-centered cubic form at normal temperature and pressure. The bond distance of a radium-radium bond is 514.8 picometres. Its density is 5.5 g/cm3. This is greater than the density of barium. The radium-barium density ratio is comparable to the radium-barium atomic mass ratio. Because both elements crystallize in the same crystal structure. Isotopes Radium has 33 isotopes with mass numbers 202 to 234. All these are radioactive. 223Ra with a half-life of 11.4 days, 224Ra with a half-life of 3.64 days, 226Ra with a half-life of 1600 years, and 228Ra with a half-life of 5.75 years are all from the decay chain of isotopes thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 Looks natural. The isotope 223Ra originates from the isotope uranium-235, the isotope 226Ra from the isotope uranium-235, and the other two isotopes from the isotope thorium 232.

"Solar System The Solar System or solar system is a system consisting of the Sun and all the objects under the gravitational control of the Sun. The solar system includes the eight planets orbiting Katiravana, its 162 (so far known) moons, the Indus asteroids, the dwarf asteroids, and thousands of other celestial bodies. Comets, igneous rocks, meteorites and interstellar asteroids are also found in the solar system. Sun Sun is also a galaxy. It is the closest galaxy to Earth (different planets and different constellations). It's a fireball. So, you can't go near it. It is many times bigger than Earth. It is about 15 million kilometers away from Earth. The Sun is the source galaxy of the Solar System, at the center of the Solar System. Many planets including Earth, billions of meteors, comets and cosmic dust orbit the Sun in various orbits. It is noteworthy that the weight of the Sun alone accounts for 98.6 percent of the mass of the Solar System. The average distance between the Sun and the Earth is about 149,600,000 kilometers. A ray of light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes, 19 seconds to reach the Earth. Katiravan is composed largely of hydrogen (about 74% by mass, and 92% by volume) and helium (about 24% by mass, 7% by volume), with minor amounts of other elements, such as iron, nickel, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, magnesium, organic matter, neon, and calcium. , also contains chromium. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. So it will be very hot. It is called Mercury in English. Mercury is the smallest planet among all the planets. The diameter of this planet is 4800 km. It is less massive than the moon. Mercury takes 88 to go around the Sun once. As the Earth we live in rotates around itself once every twenty-four hours, day and night alternate for all parts of the earth. But on Mercury, day and night alternate for long periods. Meteorologists say that when Mercury is close to the Sun, the temperature of the sunlit area of ​​Katiravan is about 400 degrees Celsius and when it is far away it is about 280 degrees Celsius. As Mercury crawls in a straight line between the Earth and the Sun, it creeps across the image of the Sun as a tiny black dot. Instead of calling it a eclipse, it is called a New Moon. Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a very hot planet. Even matter melts in it. It is the closest planet to Earth. This can be seen in the early morning sky. This planet is said to be somewhat similar to Earth in size and mass. Its diameter is 12320 km. It takes 224 days to go around the Sun once. It also appears as a black spot when it comes in a straight line between the Sun and the Earth. This event is known as Venus Moon. This happens very rarely. Finally, it was held on the eighth of June in the year two thousand and four. Astronomers say that the next one will occur on June 6, 2012. This interplanetary cycle, which has an interval of eight years, may occur after two thousand and twelve centuries, and the cloud cover around the planet has evolved. This has made it difficult to accurately study the surface of Venus. Earth Our earth is the third planet in the solar system. It is a rock sphere. Earth is surrounded by atmosphere. Two-thirds of its surface is water. Living things are able to live here because of the presence of air and water. Although the Earth is accepted as spherical, it is not perfectly spherical. Both the poles are slightly flattened and the imaginary line is slightly convex at the equator. The diameter passing through the equator is 12742 km and the diameter between the poles is 12713 km. The Earth revolves around itself and also revolves around the Sun once in 365,2563 days. Every year on the 3rd of January the Earth comes closest to the Sun. The time taken for the earth to revolve once around itself is taken as a day and the time it takes to go around the sun once is taken as a year. The rotation of the earth causes day and night, and the rotation of the sun causes the seasons. Mars Mars is the fourth planet. It is also called the Red Planet. A day on Mars is 24.5 hours and life on Mars has not yet been proven. Mars takes 687 days to go around the Sun once. It takes 24 hours and 37 minutes to revolve around itself. So like the Earth, day and night alternate there. Earth's axis is tilted twenty-three degrees. The seasons are similar to Earth's because the axis of Mars' rotation is tilted by twenty-four degrees. Since Mars takes almost twice as long to orbit the Sun as Earth does to orbit the sun, the climate is twice as long. Mars appears reddish yellow when viewed through a telescope. Jupiter is the fifth planet. It is the largest of the planets. It is called a 'giant planet' because its mass is larger than other planets. Jupiter is 1300 times bigger than Earth. Jupiter is made of gases. Jupiter has a large red region. A thin faint ring surrounds Jupiter. This ring is made of ice and dust. It takes 9 hours and 55 minutes to orbit itself once. So imagine how much faster this giant planet rotates than Earth. Whereas Jupiter takes eleven years and three hundred and fifteen days to go around the Sun once. When scientists analyzed the spectra obtained from Jupiter, they found the presence of gases such as ammonia and methane. The Earth we live on has only one satellite. But recently it has been discovered that there are sixteen satellites orbiting Jupiter. Saturn Saturn is the sixth planet. It is the second major planet. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made of gases. Saturn is surrounded by massive rings that are flat circles. Saturn can be identified by these. Put this giant Saturn in water and it will float! Isn't it amazing? Because gases on Saturn are lighter (less dense) than water. Saturn's color is yellow. It takes 29.5 years to go around the Sun once. Uranus The seventh planet is Uranus. Like Saturn, Jupiter is made of gases. There are rings around it. Uranus is. Until 1781 it was believed that there were only six planets in the solar system. The planet Uranus was accidentally discovered by a scientist named William Harsha. Its diameter is 48000 km. It takes ten hours and forty eight minutes to rotate itself. It takes 84 years to go around the sun once. Uranus has five subplanets. Neptune Neptune is the eighth planet. When viewed through a telescope, it appears bluish-green in color. The planet was discovered in 1846 by scientists at the Berlin Astronomical Observatory. It orbits the Sun once every 165 years. Fifteen hours and forty minutes will pass by itself. As this planet is very far away from the sun, it is always cold. It has two components. One of these satellites orbits the mother planet in the opposite direction every six days. Nepriun cannot be seen by the naked eye. The sun also has a family The planets in the sky centered around the sun and orbiting around it - mainly the planets visible to our eyes - belong to the solar system, scientists say. The earth we live in also belongs to the solar system. Because the earth also revolves around the sun. A surprising pattern exists among the planets considered to belong to the solar system. All the planets, known as planets, orbit the sun in the equatorial path of the sun. It is amazing that all the planets revolve around the Sun in the same direction. Each of the planets, except Uranus, revolves around itself in a counter-clockwise direction. The Sun also revolves around itself in the same direction. There are many theories as to how a family of planets could have originated for the Sun. One theory is that due to a large shock to the Sun, some parts of the Sun broke into small pieces and started crawling around the Sun as separate planets. Another theory is that the Sun collided with another planet and the new planets formed and started orbiting the Sun. New solar system discovery by European space scientists H.T. The star 10180 has been studied for the last 6 years at Lasilla, Chile. The research is being conducted with the help of a 3.6 meter telescope equipped with state-of-the-art technology. Discovery of new solar system with 7 planets in HD. They discovered a new solar system around the star 10180. It has 7 planets. Out of them 5 planets are very clearly visible. One of them looks like Saturn. Apart from these, there are also very small outer planets. This new solar system is 127 light-years away from Earth. It is similar to the existing solar system. Scientist Christophe Lowis has said that research is ongoing. [1] [2] ",Which planet is closest to Earth?,Friday,449

"British East India Company rule or Company rule in India (Company rule in India) or (Company Raj), [1]. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the Nawab of Bengal surrendered to the British East India Company, establishing the rule of the British East India Company in the Indian subcontinent. [2] From 1765, Bengal acquired the right to levy diwani in Orissa and Bihar.[3] In 1773, Calcutta served as the headquarters under the direct administration of the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, of the East India Company's territory. [4]The East India Company was a multi-shareholder, for-profit, private joint-stock company. Its board of directors and headquarters were located in London. The East India Company had its own police force, army and courts. Pitt's India Act was enacted by the British government to curb corruption and abuse of power by East India Company executives, officers and employees. The East India Company Act, 1784, after the Sepoy Mutiny, 1857, and the Government of India Act, 1858 brought by the British Government ended. In 1858, the British East India Company was dissolved and the British Empire brought the Indian subcontinent under its direct rule, administered by officers selected from the Indian Civil Service. Expanding boundaries India in 1765 and 1805, British East India Company territories, in pink. India, British East India Company territories (in pink) and other territories in 1837 and 1857 The British East India Company was established in London in 1600 by British merchants with the aim of profiting from trade in the Indian subcontinent. In India in 1611 on the coast of Masulipattanak in Andhra state, in Surat in 1612 and in Chennai in 1640 with the permission of the Vijayanagara Empire. Later they opened trading houses in Bombay city as well. Twenty years later, in 1640, factories and trading companies were established in Calcutta. The British East India Company won the competition with the Portuguese East India Company, the French India Company, and the Dutch India Company. Forces led by East India Company commanders Robert Clive and Andre Bastamandy won the Battle of Plasip in 1757 and the Battle of Buxar in 1764, gaining the right to levy taxes in Bengal, Orissa and Bihar, and in 1773 much territory in the lower Gangetic regions. Carnatic Wars (1746 – 1758), Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766-1799), Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772-1818), Anglo-Nepalese War (1814 – 16), Anglo-Burmese Wars (1824-1826), Second British -Through the Sikh Wars (1849–1856), the East India Company expanded its territory in Northwest India, West India, South India, and Northeast India.[5][6] The Treaty of Sugauli at the end of the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16) gave the British East India Company the territories of Garhwal, Kumaun, Sikkim, Darjeeling and the western Terai plains of the Kingdom of Nepal. Assam, Manipur and Arakan were captured from Burma through the Anglo-Burmese wars. Through the Anglo-Maratha wars, they captured Gujarat, Rajputana, Central India and Maharashtra from the Marathas. At the end of the Anglo–Sikh Wars (1848 – 1849)[7], the Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province were annexed by the East India Company. The territories with the cities of Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai as their capitals and the territories annexed to the East India Company such as Rogilkhand, Gorakhpur, Doab, Delhi, Assam, Sindh, Punjab Province, North West Frontier Province and Kashmir were under the direct administration of the East India Company regime. And there were countless princely states, East Indian dominions, territories of sovereign monarchs who ruled arbitrarily (without separate military forces) paying annual tribute to the British East India Company. By the early 19th century, two-thirds of the Indian subcontinent was under Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh princely monarchies. Company Rule in Chennai Province (1684-1858) The British first set foot in Tamil Nadu in the sixteenth century.[8] They built St. George's Fort in present-day Chennai. At first the English East India Company, which was only engaged in trade, gradually began to interfere in local political affairs. In 1684, the Company territories in the south were consolidated under the name Madras Province. In the 18th century, the Carnatic wars played a role for the British. After defeating the Nawab of Arcot and the French forces, many areas under their dominion came under British control. By defeating Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan in the west, the Company's rule was strengthened in the Madras province by defeating the peasants such as Kattabomman, Marudu Pandyar etc. Military and Civil Services Warren Hasting, as the first Governor-General in Calcutta in 1772, quickly expanded the East India Company's Bengal provincial army. Ayodhya gathered soldiers, Rajput Rajputs and Brahmins into company legions. After the Third Anglo-Mysore War in 1791, the Bengal provincial forces were used to support Madras provincial forces and to support foreign wars like Java and Sri Lanka. At the time of the Vellore Sepoy Mutiny, the East India Company's force in 1806 numbered 1,54,500 soldiers and officers.[10] Development works Postal and telegraph services were started. English system of education developed. The bus service was launched. Chief Governors In the British East Indies regime, only the names of the Governors-in-Chief during important events are mentioned. } Fall of East India Company rule Due to the increasing corruption in the administration of the Company rule under the East India Company, severe famine and financial bankruptcy of the Company, the dissolution of the East India Company at the end of 1858 after the Sepoy Mutiny ended the Company's rule in India and brought the Indian viceroyalty under its direct control under the leadership of the Viceroy who served under the British Empire.

"Helium is an element with the molecular formula He. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, highly non-reactive compound. This element (element) is second in the elemental table. Its melting and boiling points are the lowest of all the elements. Its atomic number is 2. It is the second most abundant element in the universe. It is also the element with the simplest structure after hydrogen. Ilium is the 6th most abundant element in Earth's sea-level atmosphere, next to nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and neon. Its wealth is 5.2 shares per million. Ilium is the second most abundant element in the cosmos after nitrogen, although it is rare on Earth. Its share is 7%. Hydrogen and helium together make up 99.9% of the universe. History Discovery of Ilium Ilium was thought to exist on Earth long before it was discovered. In 1868, French astronomer Pierre Jonsson, while investigating a total solar eclipse in Guntur, British India, unexpectedly found a new line in the yellow region of the luminous spectrum.[1][2] Since it did not match any element then discovered, he determined that it must have been caused by a new element or molecule. At that time, Lockyer and Frank Landau, the editors of the English science journal Nature, named it ileum.[3] In Greek, Elios is the sun god.[4][5][6] About 27 years later, in 1895, William Ramsay of Scotland discovered that certain minerals of thorium and uranium emit inert compounds. He determined that the inert material emitted by radioactive elements was Ilium. Its spectrum coincided with the spectral lines identified by Pierre Johnson. Ramsey is credited with discovering the element Ilium as the first to confirm it on Earth.[2][3][7][8][9][10][11][12] In 1907 Rutherford investigated radioactivity and established that ionized ium and Albach rays were the same. He named it the alpha particle because he did not know at first that the ileum was actually a nucleus. Although methane is the predominant natural fuel, only 0.3% is helium. Illium is separated from methane by fractional distillation. The technique of fractional distillation is to use the difference in boiling point to separate water from an aqueous mixture as an oily substance cannot be easily cooled and liquefied. Its boiling point is very low -268.9 degrees Celsius. It is less than other resources. When air is cooled and liquefied, even if all the elements in it are liquefied, only the eleium remains as an element without changing to a liquid state. In 1908, Ekku Kammerling Anzu, the first physicist on Ilium, obtained liquid Ilium by cooling it to a temperature below one Kelvin.[13] Spectroscopy has found that today's galaxies, especially hot ones, are rich in helium. In fact, ileum is produced by synthesis using hydrogen as a raw material. This is explained by their energy. The two types of thermonuclear reactions that occur at high temperatures are called the ""electron-electron series"" (proton-proton series), and the carbon-nitrogen cycle. In which four electrons combine to form an Ilium nucleus. The same is stimulated and the energy is released in Aitharasan Kund. Properties Ilium with chemical symbol He is stable in normal environment. Its atomic weight is 2, atomic mass is 4.003, density is 0.166 kg/cm. Its freezing point and boiling point are 1.72 K and 4.22 K respectively. Aqueous ileum undergoes another state change at low temperatures. Its lambda is called phase change. Normal aqueous ileum is called aqueous ileum – I, [3] and lambda-altered aqueous ileum is called aqueous ileum – II. This lambda transition at 2.174 degrees K causes paradoxical changes in the self-heating, flow capacity, heat conductivity, etc. of the hydrogelium. /ref>[15] Origin and production The second most abundant (23% of the baryon mass) of the known gases on Earth is ylium, although it is rare on Earth [2]. Aidaran gas takes the first place. Most of the ileum was formed by big bang nuclear synthesis one to three minutes after the big bang. Its magnitudes contribute to the scaling of cosmological models. In galaxies, Ilium is formed through hydrogen nuclear fusion and carbon nitrogen oxidation cycle involving proton-proton chain reactions [16]. புவியின் வளிமண்டலத்தில் ஈலியம் வாயுவின் அடர்த்தி ஒரு மில்லியனுக்கு 5.2 பாகங்களை மட்டுமே கொண்டது ஆகும்[17][18]. பூமியின் வளிமண்டலத்தில் பெரும்பாலான ஈலியம் பல செயல்முறைகள் வழியாக விண்வெளிக்கு சென்று விட்டாலும் கூட புதிய ஈலியம் வாயு தொடர்ச்சியாக உற்பத்தியாவதால் குறைவான இந்த அடர்த்தியானது மாறாமல் நிலையாக உள்ளது[19][20]. வளிமண்டலத்தின் ஒரு பகுதியான பூமியின் வெப்ப மண்டலத்தில் ஈலியம் மற்றும் மற்ற இலேசான வாயுக்கள் மிக அதிகமான அளவில் உள்ளன. கதிரியக்கச் சிதைவு மூலமும் ஈலியம் உற்பத்தியாகிறது. கிளிவெய்ட்டு, பிட்சுபிளண்டு, கார்னோடைட்டு மற்றும் மோனசைட்டு உள்ளிட்ட யுரேனியம், தோரியத்தின் கனிமங்களில் ஈலியம் கலந்து காணப்படுகிறது. ஏனெனில் இவை ஆல்பா கதிர்களை உமிழ்கின்றன. இவ்வழிமுறையில் இக்கற்கோளத்தில் ஆண்டுக்கு 3000 மெட்ரிக் டன் ஈலியம் உற்பத்தியாகிறது [21][22][23]. புவி மேலோட்டில் ஈலியத்தின் அடர்த்தி பில்லியனுக்கு 8 பகுதிகள் ஆகும். கடல் நீரில் ஈலியத்தின் அடர்த்தி பில்லியனுக்கு 4 பகுதிகள் ஆகும். கனிம நீரூற்றுகள், எரிமலை வாயு மற்றும் விண்கல் இரும்பு போன்ற பகுதிகளிலும் ஈலியம் சிறிய அளவில் காணப்படுகிறது. நிலத்தடியில் இயற்கை வாயு சிக்கியிருப்பது போல ஈலியமும் சிக்குகிறது. இதனால் இயற்கை வாயுவில் ஈலியத்தின் அடர்த்தி அதிகமாகும். வர்த்தக ரீதியான பயன்பாட்டுக்குரிய ஈலியம் இயற்கை வாயுவிலிருந்து தயாரிக்கப்படுகிறது. நியூ மெக்சிகோ போன்ற இடங்களில் ஈலியம் வாயுவின் அடர்த்தி மில்லியனுக்கு 5 முதல் 7 பகுதிகள் வரை மாறுபடுகிறது [24][25]. 2011 ஆம் ஆண்டின் கணக்கெடுப்பின்படி உலக ஈலியம் இருப்பு 40 பில்லியன் கனமீட்டர் என மதிப்பிடப்பட்டுள்ளது. இதில் கால் பாகம் கத்தார் மற்றும் ஈரான் நாடுகளில் காணப்படுவதாகவும் மதிப்பீடுகள் தெரிவிக்கின்றன [26]. வட அமெரிக்கா [27] மற்றும் கிழக்கு ஆப்பிரிக்கா [28] போன்ற நாடுகளில் ஈலியம் மேலும் இருப்பு இருக்கலாம் என அறிவிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. நவீன தயாரிப்பு முறைகள் இயற்கை வாயுவிலிருந்து பின்னக் காய்ச்சி வடித்தல் மூலம் ஈலியம் பேரளவில் தயாரிக்கப்படுகிறது. இயற்கை எரிவாயுவில் ஈலியம் 7% காணப்படுகிறது[29]. ஈலியம் வேறு எந்த தனிமத்தையும் விட குறைவான கொதிநிலையைக் கொண்டிருப்பதால், குறைந்த வெப்பநிலை மற்றும் உயர் அழுத்தத்தில் கிட்டத்தட்ட மற்ற அனைத்து வாயுக்களையும் விட இதை திரவமாக்கலாம். இதன் விளைவாகத் தோன்றும் கச்சா எண்ணெய் படிப்படியாக வெப்பநிலைகள் குறைக்கப்பட்டு ஈலியம் தூய்மையாக்கப்படுகிறது. மீதமுள்ள நைட்ரசன் மற்றும் பிற வாயுக்கள் வாயு கலவையிலிருந்து வீழ்படிவாக்கப்பட்டு வெளியேற்றப்படுகின்றன. கிளர்வூட்டப்பட்ட கரியானது இறுதி சுத்திகரிப்பு படிநிலையாகப் பயன்படுத்தப்படுகிறது, இதன் மூலம் பொதுவாக 99.995% தூய தரம் மிக்க ஈலியம் உருவாகிறது[3]. நியான் ஈலியத்தின் முதன்மையான மாசாக கலந்திருக்கிறது. குளிரூட்டும் முறையில் திரவமாக்கி ஈலியம் இறுதிபடிநிலையில் தயரிக்கப்படுகிறது. சில பயன்பாடுகளுக்கு நீர்ம ஈலியம் அவசியமாகிறது. பயன்கள் ஈலியம் எல்லாத் தனிமங்களைக் காட்டிலும் மிகத்தாழ்ந்த உறைநிலையைத் தனிச் சுழி வெப்பநிலைக்கு மிக அருகாமையில் கொண்டுள்ளது. அதனால் இது தாழ்ந்த வெப்பநிலை ஏற்படுத்தும் தொழில்நுட்பத்துக்குப் பெரிதும் உதவியாய் இருக்கின்றது.[30] Aqueous helium is useful for studies of superconducting magnets, for cooling nuclear reactors in space, and for low-temperature studies.[31] Anomalous electrical currents caused by thermal vibrations (non-significant) are considered noise. Diluting them with aqueous ileum results in accurate statistics. Even if the temperature is reduced to the subsonic temperature, the ileum will only liquefy at atmospheric pressure and not solidify. This can be done by increasing the working environment pressure. 30% of its volume by applying this pressure. Can be made to vary in size.[32][33] Ilium is a light substance, less dense than air, and because it is an inert substance, it can be carried in balloons and flown from high altitudes to carry out studies of the equatorial zone. However, being denser than hydrogen, ileum has 98% buoyancy.[34] Persimmons working at high external pressures at great depths in aquatic environments breathe air composed of 20% oxygen and 80% ileum. They would have removed nitrogen and replaced it with ileum. Ilium is less soluble in water than nitrogen.[35][36] So it also dissolves less in the blood. It protects against asthma. Once a drowning person reaches the surface of the water, the low pressure causes dissolved oxygen to bubble up (similar to the way dissolved air bubbles out of a soda bottle when the cap is opened), allowing the oxygen to coagulate in the joints.[37][38] It causes arthritis. As a result, drowning workers tire quickly.[39] As the ileum is breathed in, which is less dense than air, the pitch and quality of the voice change significantly. This makes it seem as if someone is suddenly speaking in a loud voice.[2][40] The speed of sound in ileum is 3 times faster than in air. The fundamental frequency in a confined space corresponds to the speed of sound in that space. So the pitch of the voice changes to breathe the ileum.[41][42] Although the ileum's coagulability is variable, it does not produce any chemical compounds under normal conditions. Studies on the formation of ylium-di-fluoride continue. Illium-neon, the elemental ion elements He 2 + , and He 2 ++ , have been detected. In ignition mode, ium is used to establish an inert atmosphere.[30] For the same reason, ylium is used in the production process of titanium zirconium, in the process of growing silicon and cerumenium crystals, as a coolant in nuclear reactors, and as a propellant in supersonic spaceships.[43][44] Another important use of ylium is as a ylium-neon laser (laser).[2] It was discovered by an American scientist named Ali Chavan. Due to the interaction between two atoms having high energy levels close to each other, the abundance of the stimulated ion can be increased and stimulated emission can be caused in the medium. Its light, monochromatic character (monochromatic) to pass the wavelength without dispersal, directivity (directonality) and similar wavefront (coherence) have been obtained, but the power expression is in the range of milliwatts. Items marked with multiple lines, such as an ileum-neon fluorescent strip, are used to identify items such as books, student answer sheets, and items sold in dental supply stores. Neon lights are used in billboards to make the advertisement visible over long distances. Ileum removes oxygen by displacement, so continued inhalation of non-toxic ileum can lead to oxygen deficiency and death.[2][41][45][46] Ilium can reduce the distortion of optical instruments caused by environmental conditions and temperature changes in bows.[3] This is because ileum has a low refractive index. It is used in portable telescopes for space probes.[47] Vacuum telescopes are too heavy to carry into space, making them unhelpful.[48] Liquid helium is used to cool the superconducting magnets. Superconducting magnets are used today in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) line view instruments[49] high-speed monorail trains, micro-compacted, electromagnet-powered devices[50], Ilium is used to cool and liquefy hydrogen and oxygen, which are used as fuel in airplanes. Ilium can be used to measure the age of rock deposits containing uranium and thorium.[2][3] Citing supplementary texts CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link) CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) Explicit use of et al. in: |author= (help) External links General With some history of helium. beginning 1996: Aga website (MP3) from the Royal Society of Chemistry's Chemistry World: More detail at the Helsinki University of Technology; includes pressure-temperature phase diagrams for helium-3 and helium-4 – includes a summary of some low temperature techniques Miscellaneous with audio samples that demonstrate the unchanged voice pitch Helium shortage Category:Elements Category:Inert resources Category:Physics of Materials ",What is the atomic number of helium?,Atomic number 2,312
"Olympic Games (Olympic Games or Olympics) is an international competition for various sports held every two years in summer and winter alternately. Thousands of athletes participate in it. Over 200 countries participate in the Olympics, considered the premier sporting event in the world.[1] The practice of holding these competitions dates back to ancient Greece. Later, in the late 19th century, the practice of holding these competitions was revived by a French nobleman named Pierre Freddie, Duke of Coubertin. He created the International Olympic Committee in 1894. Its organization and powers are defined by the Olympic Charter. The International Olympic Committee manages the Olympic movement. The Summer Olympic Games have been held every four years since 1896, excluding World War II years. The earliest Olympic Games were held in Olympia, Greece in 776 BC until 393 AD. Greek poet Panagiotis Soutzas' poem ""Dialogue of the Dead"" written in 1833 AD created interest in resuming the contests. The development of the Olympic Movement in the 20th and 21st centuries brought many changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these changes include the introduction of the Winter Olympic Games, Paralympic Games for the disabled, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenagers. The Winter Olympic Games have been held since 1924 to host the Winter Games. Initially, the Summer and Winter Olympic Games were held in the same year. Since 1994, the Winter Olympics have been held two years after the Summer Olympics. The Olympic Committee also had to make various changes in accordance with the developments in the fields of economy, politics and technology. Coubertin, the creator of this phenomenon, intended for it to be a competition involving non-professional competitors. However, the Olympic Committee changed this rule and allowed professional athletes to participate in the Games. As the importance of mass media grew, corporate advertising sponsorships developed and the contests became commercialized. The 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics were canceled due to World War II. The 1980 and 1984 games were held with limited participation as many countries boycotted the competition during the Cold War. The Olympic Movement consists of the International Games Federation, the National Olympic Committees, and the Organizing Committees for each Olympic Games. As a decision-making body, the International Olympic Committee decides which cities will host the Games. The city thus selected shall be responsible for organizing and financing the Games in accordance with the Olympic Charter. The International Olympic Committee is also responsible for deciding the program of sports to be included in the Games. Symbols like the Olympic flag, the torch, and events like the opening and closing ceremonies are part of the Olympic Games. Over 13,000 athletes participate in approximately 400 events across 33 different sports at the Summer and Winter Olympics. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded to the first, second and third place finishers in each competition. The Olympic Games have grown to include almost every country in the world. Such growth has also led to many challenges related to neglect, drug use, handouts, terrorist activities etc. Biennial competitions and the associated media publicity give many athletes the opportunity to gain national and sometimes even international fame. The Olympics also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world. Ancient Olympic Games The Ancient Olympic Games were held every four years at the Temple of Zeus in Olympia, Greece as a religious and sporting event. It was a competition between athletes from the city-states and kingdoms of Greece at that time. Although mostly athletic games were held, combat-based competitions such as jousting, horse racing, and chariot racing were also held. Many have written that during these games, all conflicts between city governments were postponed until after the games. This became known as the Olympic Peace or the Olympic Truce. But this is an untrue notion that has arisen in modern times. The Greeks never postponed wars among themselves. Although the exact origin of the Olympics is not known, there are many stories about it. Heracles, the son of the god Zeus, built the Olympic Games to honor his father. When this was finished, he walked two hundred paces in a straight line and pronounced the distance as an isutadian. This was later taken as a measure of distance. It is widely accepted that the Olympic Games originated in 776 BC. The Olympic Games of that time included running events, jumping events, discus throwing, javelin throwing, tug-of-war, and horse racing.[2][3] According to legend, the first conqueror was a cook named Koroebusu from the city of Elisha.[4] The Olympics of that time had a religious significance. In addition to sporting events, ceremonial processions were held in honor of the god Zeus and Phelps, the god-hero and mythological king of Olympia. Poems were composed about winners of sporting events and statues were erected to honor them.[5] The Olympic Games were at their peak in the sixth and fifth centuries BC. As the Romans grew in power and their influence in Greece grew, the importance of the Olympics gradually began to decline. Although there is no consensus among scholars as to when these games ceased, the majority agree that they ceased in AD 393, the year when Theodosius I banned all idolatry and related rituals. His successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.

"An electromagnet is a magnet that creates a magnetic field by flowing current. Here the magnetic field disappears when the current is stopped. Electromagnets are used as a component in electrical devices such as motors, generators, post circuits, amplifiers, hard drives, magnetic resonance imaging machines, scientific instruments, and magnetic extraction devices. It is also used in the lifting of heavy steel beams in the handicraft industry. Current flowing in a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire. In an electromagnet, the wire is wound into a coil so that the turns are very close together to concentrate the magnetic field. Then the magnetic field produced by each turn of the wire passes through the core of the coil creating a strong magnetic field. A tubular coil is called a line coil. A strong magnetic field can be created by placing a magnetic material like iron inside the coil. Due to the increase in the magnetic permeability of the magnetic material, the magnetic field strength of a magnetic field is thousand times greater than that of a normal coil. This magnetic core or iron core is called electromagnet. The direction of the magnetic field through a coil of wire can be determined using the right-hand rule.[1][2][3][4][5][6] That is, if the fingers of the right hand are bent in the direction of the current flowing through the coil, the right thumb will give the direction of the magnetic field flowing through the center of the coil. The point where the magnetic field lines appear to exit is defined as the north pole of the electromagnet. An important advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that it can be rapidly varied over a wide range of magnitudes by controlling the amount of current supplied. However, a continuous power supply is necessary to maintain the magnetic field. Function of the iron system A magnet's core material (usually iron) is made up of small rings called ""magnetic domains"" that act like tiny magnets. Before current flows in an electromagnet, these magnetic domains are seen pointing in opposite directions. So their small magnetic fields balance each other. Therefore, iron does not develop a large magnetic field. When a current flows in a wire wound over the coil, the magnetic field generated in the coil vibrates the iron coil, aligning the magnetic fields parallel to the magnetic field. So their smaller magnetic fields combine to form a larger magnetic field surrounding the magnet. As the current increases, the magnetic fields increase in order and speed, so does the strength of the magnetic field. However, since all the magnetic domains are arranged in this way, an increase in current does not increase the magnetic field significantly. This state is known as the ""saturation state"". When the coil is de-energized, most of the circuits lose their order and reach a tripped state. However, some arrangements remain unchanged. Because these constituencies face massive resistance in changing their direction. Thus the field of electromagnet becomes a weak permanent magnet. This process is called magneto repulsion. The residual magnetic field is called residual magnetic field. This excess magnetic field can be removed by demagnetization. History In 1820, the Danish scientist Anzu Christian Orsted discovered that a current flowing through a conductor creates a magnetic field around the conductor. British scientist William Sturgeon discovered electromagnetism in 1824.[7][8] His first electromagnet was made of a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron wrapped 18 times with unguarded copper wire. The iron was insulated with a varnish coating. When a current flows through the coil, the iron becomes magnetized and attracts other pieces of iron. When the current is stopped it loses its magnetism. While the piece only had a mass of 200 grams, it was capable of lifting a mass of 4 kilograms when connected to a single cell battery. By this Sturgeon realized the strength of electromagnetism. However, the sturgeon's electromagnetism was weak. Because the copper wire used was uninsulated, it was only possible to wrap the copper wire around the core once. Also, gaps had to be left between each turn of the wire. Thus, the number of circuits wound around the computer is reduced. As early as 1827, American scientist Joseph Henry developed electromagnetism.[9] By using wires guarded with silk thread, he was able to wind the wire at high forces on the fabric. He was thus able to create powerful magnets that took thousands of turns. One of these, 936 km. K. The stuffing was uplifting. Electromagnets were first used primarily in the telegraph. The magnetostatic theory of how the magnetosphere works was first proposed in 1906 by the French geologist Pierre-Annest Weiss. And the complete ""droplet engineering principle"" of magnetism was explored in the 1920s by Werner Heisenberg, Lev Landau, Felix Bloch, and others. Applications of Electromagnetism Electromagnets are often used in the following electrical and electronic engineering accessories. Engineering and Technology – Motors, Generators and Magnetic Lift Transport transformers minmani Loudspeaker Magnetic recording devices Mail round particle accelerator Electromagnetic lock Scientific instruments such as magnetic resonance imaging machines and mass spectrometers Magnetic extraction Trucks Medicine - Magnetic Resonance Wave Draft Analysis of Electromagnets The magnetic field of electromagnets is generally given by Ampère's law: ∫ J ⋅ d A = ∮ H ⋅ d l {\displaystyle \int \mathbf {J} \cdot d\mathbf {A} =\oint \mathbf {H} \cdot d\mathbf {l} } That is, the sum of the magnetizing field H around any loop in the magnetic field is equal to the sum of the currents flowing through the loop. Also Pio Savart's rule is used. This gives rise to a magnetic field due to the current flowing in the small conductor. Calculating the magnetic field and force produced by magnetic materials is difficult. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is that the field strength varies in complex ways at different points. This can be observed mainly outside the computer and in the bay spaces. Here fringing fields and leakage flux should be taken into consideration. Next, the magnetic field (B) and the force do not vary proportionally with the current. These depend on the relationship between the magnetic field (B) and the magnetizing field (H) of the applied material.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization established to liberalize and supervise international capital trade. The GATT (General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)), which had been in place since 1947, officially became operational on January 1, 1995 under the Marrakesh Agreement. The World Trade Organization regulates trade between its participating countries; It provides a stable framework for concluding business agreements through negotiations. This system leads to amicable settlement of disputes between the two countries on the basis of agreements made with the World Trade Organization, which must be signed by the government representatives of the participating countries and ratified by their respective parliaments.[1][2] Most of the issues that have attracted the attention of the World Trade Organization (WTO) so far have been the previous inconclusive trade talks, most notably the Uruguay Round (1986-1994). The organization is currently busy implementing the outcomes of the Doha Development Partnership (or Doha Round) trade negotiations that began in 2001. It is a great effort to enrich the participation of the underdeveloped countries, which constitute the majority of the world's population, and to participate on an equal footing. However, ""ongoing negotiations between major agricultural exporters and countries with a large number of impoverished populations have been dogged by an allergy to the exact process of providing 'special safety nets' to the poor during periods of high imports. Currently, the future of the Doha Round is in question. .""[3] The World Trade Organization now has 153 members,[4] accounting for 95% of the total volume of global trade.[5] The organization currently has 30 visitors who are also looking to become members. This World Trade Organization has been regularizing its activities through the regularization of office work block meetings. They meet once in two years. A general committee of the members of this organization is responsible for the implementation of the policy-level decisions taken at the meeting and also for the administration. An officer elected by the office work block meeting will be appointed to preside over it. The headquarters of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is Center William Ruppert, Geneva, Switzerland. History World Trade Organization and GATT 1947 After the Second World War, various organizations - notably the Bretton Wood institutions, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund - established GATT, the predecessor of the World Trade Organization, to promote international economic cooperation. A comparable institution for doing business, called the International Trade Organization, was successfully negotiated through negotiations. The International Trade Organization, as a specialized organization of the United Nations, is capable of supervising other issues indirectly related to trade, such as employment, investments, doing business with short notice, contracts for consumer goods, etc., in addition to removing barriers to trade. But the United States and some other countries did not accept this WTO Agreement, so it was not implemented.[6][7][8] With the absence of an international organization for trade, the GATT would 'recast itself' as an international organization within a few years of practice.[9] The GATT negotiation rounds began in 1948 and until the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995, the GATT was the only multilateral instrument that regulated international trade.[10] Between the 1950s and 1960s, despite attempts to implement a form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to function for more than half a century, on an ad hoc basis, as a multilateral treaty-governing multilateral organization.[11] Seven rounds of negotiations were held under the GATT from Geneva to Tokyo. The first round of GATT negotiations aimed to further reduce tariffs. Then, in the Kennedy Round of the mid-1960s, the GATT passed a section on trade promotion with the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Tokyo Round of the 1970s marked the first major effort to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and improve procedures, with a series of agreements that eliminated non-tariff barriers, in some cases adopting existing procedures in the GATT, and in some other cases leading to entirely new categories. Since some of these multilateral agreements were not accepted by all members of the GATT, they often provided default ""marks"". Many of these indicators were modified in the Uruguay Round, and they evolved into a variety of standards (obligations/mandates) agreed upon by all World Trade Organization members. Only four of them remained diversified (government procurement, beef, civil aviation and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members decided to eliminate the beef and dairy agreements, leaving only two.[10] Uruguay Round Just before GATT's fortieth anniversary, its members realized that GATT's methods were unable to cope with the new globalizing world economy.[14][15] In 1982, the Eighth GATT Round, known as the Uruguay Round, was held to address the shortcomings identified in the Working Group's Commentary (such as institutional deficiencies, instability caused by the spillover effects of some countries' policies on global trade, and GATT becoming unmanageable). - Launched in September 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay.[14] It was the largest trade-based and analogical franchise ever held: the negotiations transcended business practices and touched on many new sectors, notably trade in services and intellectual property, and reforms in business practices in sensitive sectors such as agriculture and textiles; All of the original GATT agreement provisions were reconsidered.[15] In April 1994, a working group meeting was held in Marrakesh, Morocco, concluding the Uruguay Round of negotiations and signing an agreement formally establishing the WTO regime, hence known as the Marrakesh Accords.[16] The GATT remains today the umbrella agreement on trade in goods of the World Trade Organization, which has remained in place due to the Uruguay Round of negotiations. forms the heart of).[14] GATT 1994 (GATT) agreement and other agreements have been legally sanctioned at the Marrakesh Final Meeting; They are recorded in a long list of 60 agreements, mergers, decisions, and adoptions. These agreements are structured around six main components: Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization Goods and Investment — Various agreements on trade in goods, including GATT 1994 (GATT) 1994 and Trade-Based Investment Measures Services Understanding — General Agreement for Services Intellectual Property — Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Dispute Resolution (DSU) Government Trade Policy Review (TPRM)[17] Office Working Group Meetings First Office Working Group Meeting The inaugural Office Working Group meeting was held in Singapore in 1994. At this meeting, among the four issues brought up for discussion for the first time, there were differences of opinion among the overdeveloped countries and developed and developing economies, and because of this they referred to the four as the ""Singapore Issues"". The second office block meeting was held in Geneva, Switzerland. A third office-building meeting in Seattle and a third in Washington ended in failure, with large crowds protesting and the police and national guard's handling of crowds drawing worldwide controversy. The Fourth Office Work Group Meeting was held in Doha, Qatar, a country in the Persian Gulf, and the Doha Development Round was initiated at this meeting. The meeting also allowed China to become a member, becoming the 143rd member. Fifth Office Working Group Meeting z This Office Working Group meeting was held in Cancún, Mexico, with a view to implementing the Toh Round Agreement. A coalition of 22 southern countries, the G20 developing countries, led by countries such as India, China [18] and Brazil, refused to accept the northerners' demands on Singapore's affairs and demanded an immediate end to EU and US subsidies to the agricultural industry. Talks then broke down and did not progress. Sixth Office Working Group Meeting The Sixth World Trade Organization Office Working Group Meeting was held in Hong Kong from 13 December to 18 December 1995. The four-year-old Doha Development Agenda was held with a focus on settlement negotiations and an aim to conclude the round by 2006. At the meeting, countries agreed to phase out subsidies for agricultural exports by the end of 2013 and subsidies for cotton exports by 2006. Among other concessions given to developing countries is an agreement to receive duty-free goods from least developed countries, underpinning the EU's ""Everything But Arms"" initiative. And the customs duties up to 3% are non-exempt. Other major issues were decided to be completed by 2010 after negotiations. Seventh Office Working Group Meeting The General Assembly of the World Trade Organization, on 26 May 2009, decided to hold the Seventh World Trade Organization (WTO) Office Working Group Meeting in Geneva from 30 November to December 2009. A note issued by AMBA President Mario Madus said that the shortcomings of the biennial meeting, which was the failure of the 2005 round of negotiations, had to be eliminated, and that the forthcoming 'minimalist' meeting would not consist of bargaining talks, but of ""small group negotiations"". Emphasizes situations in which negotiations take place openly and transparently, rather than as an organization and as a normal negotiating structure"".[19] Doha Round The WTO's current round of negotiations, known as the Doha Development Agenda, began at its Fourth Office Working Group meeting in November 2001 in Doha, Qatar. The Doha Round was an overt attempt to remove barriers and subsidies, particularly in agriculture, with a view to helping the world's poorest people, given the ambitions of globalization.[20] Its initial agenda was to strengthen the system by further reducing trade barriers, implementing new modern regulations, and fulfilling commitments already made to developing countries.[21] Despite several rounds of negotiations, office work block meetings and other meetings, the negotiations were very heated and no agreement was reached. Disagreements persisted on several key issues, including agricultural subsidies.[22] Tasks Among the various tasks of the World Trade Organization, researchers consider the following to be the most important: Overseeing the practical execution, administration and operation of the agreements concluded.[23][24] Providing a forum with a conducive environment for negotiations and settlement of issues.[25][26] In addition, the World Trade Organization's primary duty is to review and promote national trade policies, and to monitor and act upon the correctness of forward-backward harmonization and transparency of trade policies in the formulation of global economic policies.[24][26] Another key task of the WTO is to promote the understanding of WTO norms and chapters through technical cooperation and exercises as these conditions change for developing, least developed and low-income countries.[27] The World Trade Organization also engages in economic research and studies: producing assessments of world trade realities and research articles on specific topics and publishing periodic and annual reports.[28] Finally, the World Trade Organization has been working closely with Bretton Wood's two institutions, the IMF and the World Bank.[25] Principles of trade system All countries participate in the world stage and with a view to understand trade, they have defined the principles of trade and have given a shape to a structure called the World Trade Organization. This system does not define or specify consequences. That is, the organization regulates the games for business principles.[29] Five terms are important to know about the pre-1994 GATT system and the World Trade Organization: Non-discrimination. It has two major components: the most-favoured-nation (MFN) regime, and the national treatment policy Both of these define goods, services and intellectual property in WTO terms, but their precise scope and nature differ for each category. According to these preferential country MFN terms, a WTO member must establish uniform rules for all trade affairs of other WTO members, that is, a WTO member must offer to offer to other members, without discrimination, the most favorable conditions it wishes to provide for a particular product when doing business. [29] ""If some concession is made to one, the concessions must be made to all the remaining members of the World Trade Organization.""[30] National treatment means that both imported goods and domestically produced goods are treated equally without discrimination (at least after the foreign goods enter the market) and these terms are trade. It was created to remove non-fee barriers to doing so. (Example: technical standards, safety standards etc. discriminating against imported goods).[29] Reciprocal discount. The MFN rule also indicates a desire to limit the scope for free concessions arising out of the MFN rule and to have better access to foreign market participation. For a country to negotiate on this, the benefits must be greater than a unilateral liberalization; Such gains are made possible through concessions.[31] Obligations for Structured and Forced Implementation. World Trade Organization members should list the tariff commitments and access mechanisms announced in multilateral trade negotiations in a time table with figures. Such timetables establish ""top-level commitments"": a country can change its structures, but only after negotiating with its trading partners, and in doing so they have to compensate for the impact on trade. If this is not satisfied, the country complaining of the offense may invoke the dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization.[30][31] lack of light WTO members must publish their country's trade regulations, bind institutions to review administrative decisions affecting trade, provide periodic information to other members, and promptly report changes in trade policy to the WTO. Such internal opacity requirements are supported by periodic country-specific reports (Trade Policy Reviews) through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) along with complementary links.[32] The World Trade Organization systems thus improve predictability and stability, eliminate further quotas and similar restrictive practices, and ensure that imports are free of restrictions.[30] Safety valves. Under certain circumstances, governments can regulate business. Three types of progressive appropriations can be found in this direction: regulations aimed at achieving non-economic principles, regulations aimed at allowing fair competition; and classifications that allow marking for economic reasons.[32] Exceptions to MFN policies are concessions to developing countries, free trade areas and customs unions. There are 11 types of groups in the inventory forum system, each performing a specific task. All members of the World Trade Organization participate in the committees. Although the Textile Watch Committee is separate from the other groups, it is also included within the Commodity Council. The organization has its own chairman and consists of 10 members. The organization has affiliations with several groups in the textile industry.[33] The Committee on Intellectual Property-Based Business Practices provides information on intellectual property in the World Trade Organization, news and official notes of the TRIPS Council, and the work of the World Trade Organization with other international organizations in this field [34]. Group on Services The Group on Services operates under the auspices of the General Assembly and is responsible for monitoring the functioning of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The Services Committee has three sub-committees: Financial Services, Domestic Disciplines, GATS Regulations and Personal Obligations.[33] Other Committees The general committee consists of a variety of committees, working groups and working parties.[36] Details of the groups are business and environment Trade and Development (Subcommittee for Least Developed Countries) Regional Trade Agreements. Restrictions on outsourcing. Budgeting, Finance and Administration. Parties doing the work Succession or Conformity Working Groups Business, Credit and Finance Business and Technology Transfer Trade Negotiating Committee The Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) is currently negotiating the trade round. Its chairman is the highest official of the World Trade Organization. The group is currently trying to find a compromise in the Doha Development Round negotiations.[37] Voting System The World Trade Organization operates on a one-country, one-vote basis, but so far no voting conditions have arisen. It is generally the rule of thumb to make decisions based on consensus, and the relative size of the market gives them bargaining power. The advantage of consensual decision-making is that it leads to decisions that are widely agreed upon by all participants. Disadvantages of consensual decision-making include long periods of time and many rounds of negotiations before a decision is made. Future confusion may result from the use of vaguely ambiguous terms for incompatible items in contracts for final results. The reality is that WTO treaty negotiations do not take place with the consensus of all members, but through informal negotiations by small groups of countries. Such negotiations are called ""green room"" negotiations (the color of the office of the World Trade Organization chief in Geneva), or ""mini-ministry"" when they are held in other countries. Such processes have been highly criticized by developed country members of the World Trade Organization, as they have been excluded from these negotiations. Richard Harold Steinberg (2002) argues that although the WTO's harmonized governance model may lead to legitimate initial negotiations, in the final rounds they favor Europe and the United States because of the powerful bargaining power of those countries, and thus cannot be considered an equitable development.[38] Settlement of Disputes In 1994, World Trade Organization members signed the Marrakesh Agreement under the heading ""Final Law"" and expressed their understanding of the terms and procedures for the settlement of disputes (DSU) and agreed to implement it.[39] They regard dispute settlement as a central pillar underpinning the WTO's many forms of trade, and ""value it as their unique contribution to global economic development.""[40] Furthermore, WTO members can take direct action against any of their affiliate members if they believe they have violated the rules. Instead of taking action, they have voted to comply with the commercial system's multi-party dispute resolution system.[41] Implementation of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanisms would require separate DSB panels, an Appellate Body, the WTO Secretariat, arbitrators, independent experts, and a number of separate institutions.[42] Eligibility and membership The process of becoming a member of the World Trade Organization is individual for each country, and membership depends on the country's economic development and current trade performance status.[43] This process can take about five years, on average, but may take longer if the country is not fully harmonized and political reasons are intervening.[44] As a private process of the World Trade Organization, approval is given only if there is consensus among interested parties.[45] Accession Process Countries wishing to join the WTO must first submit an application to the General Assembly, detailing all of the country's trade and economic policies related to and related to WTO agreements.[46] An application to the WTO should be an agenda item and considered by an executive committee composed of all WTO members involved.[45] After receiving all the background information, the Working Committee will focus on the differences between the information provided in the application and the World Trade Organization regulations, and will scrutinize the applicant's international and domestic trade policies and laws. This working group would prescribe conditions and restrictions for an applicant country's accession to the World Trade Organization, and provide a time frame for compliance with WTO rules.[43] The final stages of compliance will involve bilateral discussions between the applicant country and the members of the Executive Committee and will explain the terms of concessions and tariffs and restrictions on market access for the supply of goods and services. Although the negotiations took place only between the two parties, the obligations of the new members were to be shared equally and equally with other World Trade Organization members according to the general terms of non-discrimination.[46] Once the negotiations between the two parties are concluded, the Executive Committee shall provide to the General Assembly or Bureau Working Group meeting an annexation package, which shall include a summary of all meetings with the Executive Committee, the Protocol of Accession (a form of membership agreement form for members), and lists (the ""Schedule"") the obligations of the country to become a member. Once the terms of accession are agreed upon by the General Assembly or a working group meeting, the applicant country must approve the accession package in its parliament before that country can become a member.[47] Members and visitors. The World Trade Organization has 153 members. (All 123 countries that participated in the Uruguay Round signed on to become members on the founding day, and all subsequent members later).[48] The 27 member states of the European Union are known as representatives of the European Community. WTO members do not necessarily have to be members of a sovereign state. Instead, they can be a fully autonomous separate entity that conducts trade relations with foreign countries and collects customs duties. This is how Hong Kong (literally ""Hong Kong, China"" 1997) joined the GATT system as a contracting state, and the Republic of China (ROC) (commonly known as Taiwan, whose autonomous status China has not accepted) became a ""single member"" of the World Trade Organization in 2002. The customs-imposed Taiwan, Penggu, Kinmen and Matsu countries are part of the ``Gou'' (Chinese Taipei).[49] A number of non-members (30) are present as observers to the World Trade Organization and efforts are underway to make them members. Iran, Iraq, and Russia remain observers and are not yet members. Other than the Holy See, other countries must reach a negotiated understanding within five years of becoming observers. Some international intergovernmental organizations are also admitted as WTO observers.[50] So far 14 countries and 2 territories have not maintained official relations with the WTO. Treaties The World Trade Organization currently oversees about 60 different treaties, each of which has the status of an international legal text. Member states must sign and accept all WTO agreements upon approval of compliance.[51] A brief note on some important agreements is given below. Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) was implemented by the World Trade Organization in 1995. The agreement has three themes, or ""pillars"": domestic sourcing, market linkages, and export subsidies. General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) was developed to extend an agreement similar to the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Methods)) created for trade in goods to the services industry. This agreement has been in force since January 1995. Agreement on Trade-Related Purposes of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) The Agreement on Trade-Related Purposes of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) imposes less extensive quality controls on many types of intellectual property (IP). Negotiations on this took place at the end of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations held in 1994. The Agreement on Sanitation and Plant-Sanitation (SPS) The use of the Agreement on Sanitation and Plant-Sanitation – also known as the SPS Agreement – ​​occurred during the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the GATT's General Agreement, and has been in the works since the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995. has Under the SPS Agreement, the World Trade Organization has issued principles clarifying boundaries for harmful substances for use in food safety (micropesticides, biocides, testing and matching specifications) and animal and plant health (imported pests and diseases). Treaty on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) The Treaty on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) is an international agreement of the World Trade Organization. It occurred during the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on GATT, and has been in the works since the establishment of the World Trade Organization in late 1994. These work to prevent disruption to business due to technical negotiations, quality control and testing and certification"".[52] Review The objective of the World Trade Organization is to promote barrier-free trade and stimulate economic growth. Critics of free trade argue that income levels between rich and poor countries tend to diverge rather than converge (ie the rich get richer but the poor remain poorer).[53] Martin Khor, director of the Third World Network, says the World Trade Organization has failed to manage the global economy impartially and its operations are skewed in favor of rich countries and multinational corporations, leaving smaller countries with less bargaining power to suffer. that the Uruguay Round agreements with the World Trade Organization are of no use to developing countries, and that the market conditions for industries have not improved as a result; that little by little the concession given to the textile industry has been withdrawn and nothing favorable has happened to them; that non-tariff barriers ie anti-piling measures have increased; and claims that subsidies for domestic sourcing and agricultural exports are still excessive in rich countries.[54] However, Jagadish Bhagwati asserts that producers in poorer countries have too much tariff protection, and that those countries also attack in greater numbers against hoarding or dumping than rich countries.[55] Other critics say that labor relations and environmental issues have been overlooked. Steve Charnovitz, director of the Global Environment and Trade Study (GETS), believes that the World Trade Organization ""must address concerns between trade and workers and the environment"".[56] Furthermore, trade unions scoff at references to industrial rights in advanced countries, and his argument is that the more the world trade system moves forward with globalization, the more environmental and labor rights will fall behind.[57] On the other hand, Khore responds that ""if environmentalism and trade unions enter the global trade system, [...] social and cultural issues can in principle be accommodated"".[58] Bhagwati also criticizes that ""rich country boycotts are an atrocity to impose irrelevant agendas on trade agreements"". .[59] Thus, both Bhagwati and Arvind Panakaria of Columbia University criticize the introduction of TRIPs into the World Trade Organization, fearing that such anti-trade agendas may one day run out of control and cripple the system.[60] Other critics view the WTO's decision-making system as complex, inefficient, disconnected from the organization, and non-inclusive, and charge it with a small, informal steering committee (a ""consultative forum"") to facilitate consultation on trade-related issues among member countries. [61] The Third World Network has called the World Trade Organization ""a highly opaque international organization"" because ""developing countries, which constitute the majority of WTO operating systems, have no mechanism to truly exercise their power""; The network also insists that ""democracy should give opportunities to social groups and institutions to express their views and to base policies and decisions on them.""[62] Some non-governmental organizations, such as the World Federalist Movement, the World Trade Organization, have set up a parliament similar to democracy. It argues that the performance is better, but other critics have not heeded this.[63] Some libertarians and small-state think tanks, such as the Ludwig von Mises Institute, oppose the World Trade Organization, accusing it of being a bureaucratic and anti-investment institution known for political interference rather than unfettered trade. H. Rockwell Jr. of Lovell, president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, says. . . What the World Trade Organization says is that US exporters should be barred from setting up branch offices in foreign countries, saving them up to 30% of the income tax they have to pay to the government. Now the American tax rate should be raised and other loopholes removed, otherwise there will be a situation of giving new subsidies on a large scale, which will greatly affect the inflation sector of our country.

"Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational software technology company. It is the largest software company in the world. It is involved in the production, development, ownership and support of various types of computer software. It is headquartered in Redmond, Washington. It was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975. Microsoft is the world's largest software maker by revenue.[4] It is also the company with the highest total market capitalization worldwide.[5] Windows operating systems and Microsoft Office are its main products. Microsoft started out as a company that developed and sold BASIC translator software for the Altair 8800. Later, it introduced the MSDOS operating system in the 1980s and became a pioneer in the production of stand-alone desktop operating systems. In turn, Microsoft developed and sold a series of graphical operating systems called Windows. Thus Microsoft reached the position of ""Microsoft's software in every home and every desk"". In 1986, Microsoft made three of its employees billionaires and 12,000 millionaires thanks to the initial public holidays and subsequent stock price booms. Since the 1990s, it has expanded itself from the operating system market through acquisitions and mergers. In 2011 it bought Izukai Technology for $8.5 billion; It was the largest acquisition to date.[6] As of 2013, Microsoft is the leader in desktop and laptop operating systems and office productivity software applications (especially with Microsoft Office). It also develops and sells various software applications for desktop computers and laptops. It also seeks to dominate Internet search engines, the virtual game industry (with Xbox and Xbox 360 offerings), the digital services market (via MSN), and mobile phones (via the Windows Phone operating system). In June 2012, Microsoft entered the PC vendor market for the first time with its Microsoft Surface handheld computer. In the 1990s Microsoft was accused of engaging in proprietary business practices and anti-competitive practices. Lawsuits were filed alleging that it imposed unreasonable restrictions on the use of its software and used false information in its marketing efforts. The United States Department of Justice and the European Commission found that Microsoft acted illegally. The company name ""Microsoft"" is a portmanteau of the English words microcomputer software. Bill Gates first mentioned ""micro-soft"" in a letter to Paul Allen in July, 1975.[7] The current form was incorporated in the state of New Mexico on November 26, 1976[8]. The company is headquartered in Redmond, Washington state, United States. This is why Microsoft is sometimes called the Redmond Company. The company's operating platform, Windows, has been released in multiple versions and is a fixture in the computer world. The company has 88,000 employees working in many countries around the world. Since January 14, 2000, Steve Palmer has been the Chairman. On 4 February 2014, Satya Nadella was appointed as the CEO of Microsoft. He is an Indian. Also, John Thompson was chosen as the new CEO of Microsoft. The company announced that Bill Gates, who has been serving as chairman, will now serve as a technical advisor. History Sharpening of the trademark Microsoft's ""Pac-deer"" logo, designed by Isaac Baker, was used from 1987 to 2012.[9][10] Microsoft logo from 2006–2011[10] trademark in 2011–2012.[11] 2012–present: Introduced on August 23, 2012, the logo represents the ""world of animation"" and Microsoft's ""variety of products"".[12] References External links Category:Microsoft Category:American corporations Category: Companies listed on Nasdaq Category:Computer hardware companies ",Who founded Microsoft?,Bill Gates and Paul Allen,396
"Mongolia is the second largest landlocked country in the world. It is located in the Asian continent. It is bordered by Russia to the north and China to the south. Its political system is a parliamentary republic. Ulaanbaatar is the capital and largest city of the country. History Mongolia was a country ruled by numerous nomadic empires. This reign lasted until the creation of the great Mongol Empire founded by Genghis Khan in 1206. After the reign of the Yuan dynasty, the Mongol Empire collapsed, and the people once again had to live a nomadic life. After the sixteenth century, Mongolia was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. In the latter part of the seventeenth century, part of Mongolia was ruled by the Qing dynasty. When the Qing dynasty collapsed in 1911, Mongolia was declared an independent state. However, they had to fight again. For them the Soviet Union helped the Mongols. In 1921, the world recognized Mongolia as an independent country. Mongolia is still a predominantly rural country. The Mongolian Red Cross Society was established in 1939. Its head office is located in Ulaanbaatar. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's interest in Mongolia waned. Currently China and South Korea are trade and political partners of Mongolia. Geography and Climate Mongolia is the nineteenth largest country in the world after Iran. Mongolia consists mostly of grasslands and forested areas. This is 11.2% of Mongolia's total land area. Temperatures here drop to −30 °C (−22 °F) during January. Provinces The Mongolian country is divided into 21 provinces or states. Each province or state is divided into 329 districts.

Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet is used for writing here. Agriculture In 2002, 30% of households were based on livestock. Many herders in Mongolia also lived a nomadic life. Mongolia lost 96.7 million animals due to extreme cold in years like 2009 and 2010.

"An elephant is a herbivorous (leaf-eating) mammal. It is the largest of all land animals. It is also very long-lived (~70 years). It is the longest living land animal besides humans. Elephants are very strong. The beasts of prey and the highest in the food hierarchy of wild animals, the lion (Arima), the tiger, etc., are unapproachable in strength. Lions gang up and kill a tired or young elephant that might come alone. However, such incidents are very rare. Elephants live in families. Also, they have high memory capacity. Only three elephants remain in the world today. They are African bush elephants, African forest elephants and Asian elephants. There are significant differences between them. Generally, all elephants live up to about 70 years. A male elephant is called Kaliru. A female elephant is called Bd. A baby elephant is called a calf or cub. The sound made by an elephant is called bellowing. Elephant Species African elephants are larger in stature than Asian elephants. They have large ear lobes. Both male and female African elephants have tusks. However, ivory is rarely found in Asian female elephants. The back of African elephants curves slightly inwards behind the head and is flat without raised forehead ridges. These have two petals at the apex of the thallus. But the front feet have four or five claws and the hind feet have three claws. Asian elephants have slightly raised backs. There are two ridges on the forehead and small ear lobes. There is only one petal at the apex of the thallus (upper margin). The front feet have five claws and the hind feet have four claws. Food and Habitat Elephants are herbivores or herbivores. They like to eat bamboo and sugarcane. They spend 16 hours a day gathering food. Also, their digestive capacity is very slow. Therefore, 40 percent of these foods are digested. Hence, they tend to consume a lot of food. Well-grown elephants consume about 140 to 270 kg of food per day. Physique Male elephants are typically 3 meters tall and weigh 6000 kilograms. Elephant skin is very thick. There will be a thickness of about 3 cm. However, it will be slow. Thus, mosquitoes etc. will also bite. An elephant has four strong legs. Despite its bulky body, the elephant can climb and descend hills and steep places efficiently. The proverb ""the foot of an elephant glides"" is a reference to the elephant's ability to walk in long ups and downs. Trunk The special feature of an elephant is its trunk. It is best seen only in elephants. Although a few animals have a slightly elongated frontal nose (like the proboscis monkey), there are no animals with long trunk-like limbs. The trunk is made up of a total of 40,000 muscles. It is flexible in all directions. At the tip of the trunk are the nostrils through which the elephant breathes, and tiny, highly sensitive fingertips.[1] The trunk can lift anything from a small stick to a large tree. They usually help in picking up food and drinking water. The elephant repels attacks from hostile animals with its trunk. Because the neck is short the prominence of the trunk is great. Tusk Elephants have two tusks. These are called elephant lines. This elephant coat is present only in male elephants (Kalurukku) in Asiatic Indian elephants and not in female elephants (Pitukku). But African wild elephants, both male and female, have a stripe (both male and female). The elephants living in Sumatra and Borneo, the elephants of Sri Lanka, are bisexual (Kaliru, Pd) and often have an elephant line. An elephant's tusk is an extension of an elephant's molars. Hence these are also called elephant's tusks or tusks (tusks and tusks mean teeth). Tusks can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet). And they can weigh up to 90 kilograms. These tusks are also used for trade. In March 2015, Ethiopia burned six tons of ivory taken from several elephants.[2] Leather Elephant skin is very thick. Thick skin is found in most parts of the body. The skin is about two and a half centimeters thick. However, the skin around its mouth and inside the ear is thin. Asian elephants generally have more hair on their skin than African elephants. Elephants usually smear mud or dirt all over their bodies. This is an important characteristic of elephant society. It helps to protect the skin of the elephant from the sun's heat and radiation. Although the elephant's skin is thick, it is very sensitive. This is why elephants spit mud or dirt after bathing. Legs They have strong legs to support the elephant's large body. They don't need much muscle power to stand because of their straight legs and wide feet. So they can stand for a long time without resting. African elephants often do not sit unless they are sick or injured. But Asian elephants rest often. The elephant has got a broad round foot (foot). The African elephant has three tusks (claws) on its hind legs and four on its front legs. The Asian elephant has four tusks on the hind legs and five on the front legs. Elephants can swim and climb well. These cannot be jumped. Ears Elephants have very large broad lobed ears. They play an important role in maintaining the elephant's body temperature. Elephant's ears are full of blood vessels. The ambient air cools down as the heated blood flows into the ears. Then it goes into the body and lowers the temperature. Due to blood circulation, this process is continuous and the temperature is kept under control. This is why elephants are always seen moving their ears. The upper margin of a grown elephant's ear is folded outward in the Asian elephant, and curled inward in the African elephant.[3] Cognition The elephant's brain is the largest of all land animals. It weighs a little over five kilograms. Elephants have good memory. After elephants and dolphins, elephants are considered to be the most intelligent animals. Elephants are said to be second to humans in intelligence. Elephant brains are also superior in structure and technique. They also learn to use tools. Elephants are generally compassionate.[4] Sensory Sense Elephants have excellent hearing and sense of smell. The elephant's eye is slightly myopic. Thus, an elephant relies on its keen sense of hearing and subtle sense of smell rather than its sight.[5] Their trunks are also sensitive. Not only their ears but also their trunks are capable of sensing vibrations. Their feet are capable of sensing very low frequency sound waves. Social Life The social life of greens is different from the life of pits. Embryos live with their mother's group until they reach puberty, then mostly alone. But the Bds live as a well-knit family of mother, sister and daughter. Adolescence is also observed during the breeding season. Self-awareness Elephants are self-aware. It is established by glass testing. Elephants recognize themselves when placed in front of a mirror. This ability has so far only been found in baboons, some monkeys, and dolphins. A study conducted among domesticated elephants in Zimbabwe suggests that elephants have the ability to understand a person's pointing.[6] A breeding elephant has a gestation period of 22 months. This is the longest gestation period in mammals. They usually give birth to only one calf. Twins are very rare. A newborn baby elephant weighs between 90 – 115 kilograms. Before, during, and after calving, the elephant is greatly assisted by the presence of other adult elephants. From birth, the calf is raised by the herd. Threats Poaching A major threat to elephants is poaching. Elephants are hunted for their tusks. Large, long-lived and slow-breeding elephants, over-hunting has a major impact. They are large and cannot be hidden easily. Each elephant takes years to grow and breed. Each elephant needs an average of 140 kilograms (300 pounds) of leaves per day. Due to the destruction of large animals like tigers and lions, small herbivores competing for elephants' food are multiplying and destroying plants, making it difficult for elephants to get food. Elephants are rarely killed for food by animals other than humans. Habitat Shrinkage Another important threat is the destruction of elephant habitats. Humans are destroying elephant habitats for agricultural expansion. This creates conflicts between the interests of humans and the interests of elephants. For example, elephants enter new agricultural settlements, destroying crops and endangering lives of people. An average of 150 elephants and 100 humans die in Sri Lanka every year due to such conflicts. Deforestation also reduces the habitat of elephants. Habitat loss is said to be the primary reason for the extinction of Asian elephants. Elephants require large areas of forest to survive. Because elephants enter an area in droves and destroy trees and plant vines. Then they go somewhere else. Thus the destroyed forests go to new places and re-grow and come back to the same place and get food. As habitats shrink, food runs out very quickly.[7] Humans and Elephants As elephants are killed legally and against the law by humans, there are unintended consequences for elephants' physiology. Ivory poachers in Africa hunt elephants with large tusks, leaving the remaining elephants with small tusks or no tusks. Newly born cubs are also more likely to be born with these, leading to the addition of tuskless genes in new generations, leading to the birth of large numbers of tuskless elephants. The number of such elephants has increased from 1% in 1930 to 30% in some areas. Edentulism was once a rare genetic mutation and is now becoming a common hereditary trait. Mortality Elephants can die of heart failure, heart attack, and cerebral hemorrhage.[8] Elephant in Sangam Literature In Tamil Sangam literature, the elephant is mentioned in more than 170 names.

"Sheep (Ovis aries) is a four-legged, foraging, mammal. Like all carnivores, it belongs to the order Artiodactyla. Although sheep refers to several related species, in everyday usage it most commonly refers to the species Avis aeris. Domesticated sheep are the most common of the breeds that comprise it. It is said that the number of these in the world may be as high as one billion. They are thought to have originated from the mouflon, a subspecies of wild sheep found in Europe and Asia. This species has been domesticated for agricultural needs since ancient times and is raised for wool, meat and milk. Sheep's wool is used more than any other animal. 45 kg of wool sheared from one sheep in Australia.[1] Sheep farming has been practiced in most human settlements around the world. This was the basis of many civilizations. Australia, New Zealand, South and South Central American nations and the British Isles are closely associated with goat farming in the New Age. A group of goats is called a herd or flock and its young calf is called a calf. Sheep has been an important animal in the history of agriculture. And this animal is very close to human culture. Properties Horns Domestic sheep are small mobile animals. Closely grown hairs known as wool are usually found in sheep. The horns are curled after growth. Domesticated sheep differ from their ancestors and related wild animals in several characteristics. Humans may have selected it as a domesticated animal because of its unique genetic traits suitable for domestication [2] [3]. A few ancient breeds of sheep have retained some of the characteristics of their wild relatives, such as the short tails. Depending on the breed, most sheep do not have horns. In some species both males and females have horns. In some breeds only male sheep have horns. Most horned goats have a single pair of horns and rarely multiple horns in some species [4]. Fur and colors Another distinguishing characteristic is color. Wide variation in color is seen from sheep's wild relatives. Color variation in wild sheep is very low, with mostly variations in brown hues. But domestic sheep have a variety of colors ranging from pure white to dark indigo, but also brown and uniform spots or patches [5][6]. Sheep with white fur, which can be easily colored, were easily tamed and were bred for breeding in the early stages. Also the valuable white wool was the main reason for its rapid spread. However, many modern breeds of colored sheep are now being bred. A small number of colored sheep are also found in white sheep flocks. It is a recessive condition of the white trait [5][6] [7][8]. White wools are highly prized in commercial markets and are therefore preferred by all. The nature of the fur varies widely within species from densely coiled to long hair-like. Such variations and quality in wool are common among sheep within the same flock. Hence color based grading of furs is gaining commercial importance. [9] Height and weight There are variations in the height and weight of sheep depending on the breed. Ewes are selected for breeding because of their growth rate and good heredity at maturity [9].Ewes bred for mating range in weight from about 45 kilograms to 100 kilograms (100 and 220 lb). Male rams (rams) raised for breeding range in weight from 45 kg to 160 kg (100 and 220 lb) [10]. Teeth and Lifespan A sheep's teeth are closely related to its lifespan. A young sheep has 20 teeth with all the deciduous teeth erupted [11]. A mature sheep has 32 teeth. Unlike other moving animals, teeth are found only in the lower jaw. The upper jaw looks like a hard toothless foam pad. The teeth help grip the leaf blades. The back teeth grind them and then swallow them. Eight mandibular incisors are found in hummingbirds. But there is some dispute that two of the eight teeth are different except for six. For sheep teeth are found according to the coordinate system 0.0.3.34.0.3.3 or 0.0.3.33.1.3.3 [12]. A long diastema is seen between incisors and molars. A sheep's age can be easily estimated by looking at its front teeth early in life. Every year the baby teeth are replaced by a pair of larger permanent teeth. Thus the age of the sheep is about four years when the entire set of eight permanent teeth has been replaced. Then, with increasing age, the front teeth continue to lose. This makes it difficult for goats to ingest and digest food and affects health and production. Because of this, the reared sheep start moving towards old age after four years of age. The average lifespan of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, although some sheep may live up to 20 years [13][14][15] Sheep have excellent hearing and a fear response to noise. [16]. Uses Used as meat. Also used for fat needs. Wool is used as clothing and woolen goods for human needs. Varieties Some sheep are raised for meat and fat. Some are raised for wool. Among the sheep reared for meat and fat, we can mention Tailsati goats, Hissar goats etc. There are four main types of sheep bred for wool: fine haired sheep, medium haired sheep, semi-rough haired sheep and rough haired sheep. Varieties in Tamil Nadu Sevvadu found in Tirunelveli district, Pattanam goat found in Ramanathapuram district, Pattanam goat found in Pudukottai district, Kacha Kaththi goat found in Madurai district, these 3 breeds have traditional pride. Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu is divided into two types namely Chevvadu, Arichevvadu and Karunchevvadu. They are grown in areas like Melaneelithanallur, Manoor, Papagudi, Alankulam, Nanguneri, and Palayangottai. In addition to these, 8 types of traditional goats are the red goat in Chennai region, the black goat found in Trichy region, the Mecheri goat found in Salem region, the Kurumbai goat in Coimbatore, the Nilgiri goat in Nilgiris district, the white goat in Ramanathapuram district, the Vempur goat, and the Geezakarisal goat.[17] ] Production and consumption Consumption of mutton A 2016 report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD-Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO) on global mutton production and consumption is as follows [18] Sudan – 10.5 kilograms (23lb) per capita Kazakhstan – 8.1 kilograms (18lb) Australia – 7.4 kilograms (16lb) Algeria – 7.1 kilograms (16lb) Uruguay – 5.7 kilograms (13lb) Saudi Arabia – – – – – Goat Meat Production The table below lists the world's largest producers of goat meat.

"The basic unit of time is the second or second, as determined by the International System of Units (SI). Its code and short code are as follows: Code: (English: s; Tamil: વ or સ્યાન or સ્ડ) Short code: (Abbreviated code: English: s; Tamil: વ).[1][2] Minutes are obtained when the hour is first divided into sixty divisions. The first division of the hour gives the minutes and the second division of the hour into sixty divisions gives the seconds or seconds. The second division is called 'Second' in English.[3] Cesium (atomic mass: 133) has a period of 9 192 631 770 periods of radiation when it transitions between two microscopic levels in atomic physics. This is called the second or second in the SI unit.[1][4] A second (or second) is the basic unit used to measure time.[5] 60 seconds = 1 minute (hour).[6] Definition History Early Civilizations: Early civilizations divided the day into smaller segments and gave separate names to the elements. But no one has formally used the word second or second for the fraction of a given time. BC In 2000 the Egyptians divided a day equally into twelve hours of day and twelve hours of night. Hence the degree of length of hours in days and nights also differed according to seasonal variations. The Hellenistic astronomers Hipparchus (c. 150 BC) and Ptolemy (c. 150) divided the hour into sixty parts (the number system under sexagesimal fractions). They used a mean hour (1/24 day), simple fractions of an hour (1/4, 2/3, etc.), and a time angle (1/360 day, or the equivalent of four modern minutes).[7] ] BC After 300 AD the Babylonians calculated a day using the following system of fractions of sixty. Each subsequent subsection is divided by sixty. That is, 1/60, 1/60, 1/60 is calculated as a power of sixty. Its accuracy is equal to 2 microseconds.[8] The Babylonians did not use hours. But a double duration of 120 modern minutes was used. A duration—estimated at four long minutes. A barleycorn lasts 3 1/3 modern seconds (modern Hebrew's calendar arc),[9] but is not subdivided into smaller units under the fractions of sixty. Based on subdivisions of the lunar cycle: Circa 1000, the Persian scholar al-Biruni used the Arabic system of second or second. He divides the time between the two avayadhas into weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and third and fourth afternoon Sundays.[10] In 1267, the medieval scientist Roger Bacon, in a Latin account, divided between the third and fourth full moons into hours (horae-horae), minutes (minuta-minuta), seconds (secunda-secunda), thirds (tertia-tertia). and defined the fourth (quarta-quarta) in a specific calendar.[11] Modern seconds or seconds are divided using decimal numbers as follows - the third code word (1⁄60th of a second) Other languages ​​also use the word seconds or seconds. Example: Polish (turcja-tercja) and Turkish (salise-salise). Based on mechanical clocks: In the late 16th century, the earliest clocks used to show seconds appeared. After the invention of mechanical clocks it became easy to measure seconds or seconds accurately. This is against the intended time shown by the sundial. In the Fremersdorf collection, a clock depicting Orpheus, a push clock with a second hand with a spiral bow, attracted the most attention. It started in 1560 and finished in 1570.[12]:417–418[13] In the third quarter of the 16th century, Taqi al-Din created a clock that showed every 1/5 minute.[14] In 1579, Jost Bürgi made a clock showing seconds for William of Hesse.[12]}} In 1581, Tycho Braghi made restored clocks. He used it in his astronomical observatories. They showed minutes and seconds. However, they are not accurate enough to predict seconds. In 1587, Tycho complained that his four clocks differed by four seconds more or less. In 1644, Marin Mersenne measured seconds using a pendulum 39.1 inches long (0.994). It worked with projected gravitational acceleration. He accurately calculated that the pendulum takes one second to move forward and one second to move backward.[15] In 1670, London clockmaker William Clement combined this second pendulum with Christian Icon's original pendulum clock.[16] From 1670 to 1680, Clement made several improvements to his clocks. In 1832, Carl Friedrich Gauss proposed the second as the basic unit of time in his millimeter-milligram-second standardized system of units. In 1862, the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) agreed that ""on scientific grounds, all calendars should use the second, the mean base unit of solar time"".[17] On the basis of part of a year: NPTs were described in Newcomb's Solar Motion Chart (1895), based on Earth's motion. Based on astronomical observations between 1750 and 1892, a formula for estimating the value of the sun's motion was developed.[18] In particular, the tables used for most of the 20th century were based on Newcomb's solar movement. (1900 to 1983). Also, Ernest William Brown's lunar tables were used from 1923 to 1983. Based on the Cesium Microwave Atomic Clock: After several years of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, England, and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Astronomy Station confirmed the relationship between the cesium atom's microwave transition frequency and astronomical period. .[19] In this, W. W. V. (WWV) used a common visual measurement method based on signals received from a radio station.[20] They found and confirmed that the astronomical period (ET), the second or second, the frequency of the selected cesium atom had the same magnitude of 9,192,631,770 ± 20 cycles.[19] (The SI second was already adopted. The SI second was slightly shorter than the second value of the mean solar period.[21][22]) Relativistically, the SI second value is defined as the exact time of the Earth's motion and rotation.[23] A proposed optical atomic clock based on: Ludlow et al Quote: Optical atomic clocks pose a challenge to atomic clocks operating in the microwave region today.[24] The National Research Council of Canada indicates that 2.5 × 10-11 is ""relatively uncertain"". Instead of an atomic clock based on an iodine (atomic weight 127) molecule, he advocated the use of a strontium (atomic weight 88) ion trap.[25] Uncertainties rival the NIST-F1 cesium atomic clock in the microwave region, which is estimated to average sixteen parts of a day to the power of ten in terms of frequency.[26][27] A second is defined as follows according to the exact position. A second is defined in terms of micro-energy differences caused by the magnetic field in the nucleus of a cesium-133 atom when it is in its ground state. A second is the duration of 192 631 770 oscillations between two very fine energy gaps in the ground state of a cesium-133 atom at a stationary temperature of 0 K (Kelvin). There are 3600 seconds in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So one second is equal to 24 seconds.

"A solar system or solar system is a system formed by the gravitational binding between a star and the surrounding matter. It is defined by the Universal Astronomical Union as consisting of eight planets orbiting the Sun and five asteroids. This system includes large planets orbiting directly around the halo, smaller asteroids and small haloes, and satellites orbiting indirectly around the halo. The radial system formed due to the gravitational contraction of a massive molecular cloud 4.6 billion years ago. The radiator itself carries most of the weight of the system. The next most massive planet is Jupiter. The four planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are known as terrestrial planets. These are usually formed of rocks and metals. The other four exoplanets are more massive than the terrestrial planets. Among them, the largest planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are known as warm giants because they contain mostly hydrogen and helium, while Uranus and Neptune are called cold giants because they contain high-melting-point materials such as methane and ammonia. All move around Katiravan in separate orbital paths. The radial system also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, consists mostly of metals and elements like the inner planets, in which the asteroid Ceres is located. The icy Kuiper Belt lies in Neptune's orbit. It contains the asteroids Pluto, Aumia, MacMac and Aries. Apart from these two areas, various small items also travel unhindered. Satellites orbit six planets, at least four asteroids and many smaller objects. These are also called moons. Each of the exoplanets is surrounded by a planetary ring of dust and debris. The star system is located in Orion's arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION For thousands of years mankind did not understand or accept the radiation system. They believed that the earth was stationary and at the center of the universe. They believed that the earth belonged to a different category than the divine objects traveling through the visible air. Both the Indian mathematician and astronomer Areopatta and the Greek philosopher Aristotle reordered the cosmos [5] as research speculation. A scholar named Arichutarkasu hypothesized a system centered on Katiravana. However, it was Nicolaus Copernicus who mathematically declared that the Sun is at the center of the Sun system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei discovered that Jupiter had a globule and four moons orbiting it. Following up on his discoveries, Christian Aixens found a moon called Titan orbiting Saturn and a ring of planets around Saturn. In 1705 Edmund Ely realized that a comet returns to the same object every 74-75 years. This was the first evidence that objects other than planets exist in the solar system. In 1838, Friedrich Bessel was the first to find a reliable distance between a star and another star through parallax error. The subsequent development of observational astronomy and unmanned spacecraft enabled detailed studies of the solar system. System An astronomical unit is the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Kathiravan Kathiravan is a galaxy in the center of the Kathirava system. Its mass (332,900 Earth masses) accounts for 99.86 percent of the total mass of the solar system. It emits huge amounts of energy by fusing its internal hydrogen atoms with helium. That energy is mostly radiated into space through electromagnetic radiation. Katiravan is a G-type main sequence galaxy. With an absolute magnitude of +4.83, Kathiravan is more luminous than about 85% of the galaxies in the Milky Way. Most of those constellations are constellations. Kathiravan belongs to a metal-rich type of galaxy. The inner part of the solar system consists of four exoplanets or planetary bodies that are densely packed with rocks. Two of them have separate moons. They do not have planetary rings. They mostly contain high melting point metals like sand salts on the outside and metals like iron and nickel in the core. Of the four planets, Venus, Earth and Mars are surrounded by rigid spheres. These are characterized by impressive volcanic ridges and architecturally elegant surfaces. It has rifts and volcanoes. The name subplanet should not be confused with the name inferior planet. Inferior planets are Mercury and Venus, which are closer to the Sun than Earth. Mercury Mercury is the closest planet to the Milky Way and the smallest of the planets in the Milky Way. It is at a distance of 0.4 AU from Katiravan. It has no natural satellites. It is famous for its geological features. Hanging craters are located in pressurized volcanoes. They were probably formed by condensation that occurred during the formation of the ocean [6]. Mercury's atmosphere is negligible. The atoms in it explode on the surface when struck by the radiant wind [7]. It is rich in ferrous metal in the core. Its thin 'mist' has not yet been explained. Tentative theories suggest that its outer layers have been completely stripped away by the impact, or that the energy of the young star has prevented it from accreting.[8][9] Venus Venus is a planet similar in size to Earth. It is at a distance of 0.7 AU from the radius. Like Earth, it has a thick mantle of sandy soil (silicate) around an iron core. It has an atmosphere nine times denser and drier than Earth's. It has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet. Its surface temperature can easily reach 400 °C. This is due to its atmosphere being rich in Pingudil [10]. Current geological activities have not yielded any conclusive evidence of geological activity there. It has no magnetic field to prevent its atmosphere from draining away. Hence its atmosphere is continuously replenished by volcanic emissions [11]. Earth is the largest and densest of the Earth (1 Ma). It is only in this that geological activities continue. Only one planet in the universe has living organisms.[12][12][12][12][12][12][12][12][12][8][7] It is the only terrestrial planet to have a liquid hydrosphere. This feature is unique to this one. And the 'Ndathattu' mechanism found in Earth adds to its uniqueness. Earth's atmosphere is different from the atmospheres of other planets. Such differences arise because oxygen contains 21 percent of the oxygen that organisms need to survive [13]. It has only one natural satellite, the Moon. The moon itself is known as the largest of the satellites of the terrestrial planets in the solar system. Mars Mars (1.5 Ma) is a smaller planet than both Earth and Venus. Its atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide. It also features sprawling volcanoes like 'Olympus Mans' and rift valleys like 'Vallis Marinaris'. They highlight its geographical activities.[14] Its red color is due to the iron oxides [15] it contains. Mars has two small natural satellites. They are called 'Timos' and 'Phobos'.[16][17] Outer Galactic System The outer Galactic System is home to gas giants and their satellites. Many short-lived comets (including the constellations called 'centaurs') orbit. They are filled with rapidly evaporating water, ammonia, and methane because they are located at great distances outwards from the sun. But rocks in the inner core remain solid when cold. Outer Planets There are four outer planets or giant planets in the solar system. Together they orbit Katiravan's circular path with 99 percent accuracy. Jupiter and Saturn have maximum hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune have the most ice. Astronomers therefore classify these separately as 'ice monsters'.[18] All four planets have rings, although only Saturn's rings are easily visible from Earth. Jupiter Jupiter (5.2 Ma) is a planet with 318 times the mass of Earth. That is 2.5 times more than the total mass of other planets. It is formed by both hydra and ileum. Its powerful internal heat has given rise to several permanent features known as the atmosphere, the Milky Way, and the 'Great Red Spot'. Jupiter has sixty-three known moons. Four of its largest moons, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, resemble terrestrial planets. Similar features can be seen in both volcanism and internal heating.[19] The 'Kanimedu' moon is larger than Mercury in the radial system. Saturn Saturn (9.5 Va) has similar features to Jupiter, known for its rings, in its spheroid and magnetosphere. Saturn has 60 percent of Jupiter's volume. But it is third in terms of mass. Saturn is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water. It has 60 known satellites. Among them, the moons 'Titan' and 'Enceladus' have been found to have geological activity. More ice though! [20] Titan, the second largest moon in the solar system, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere. Uranus Uranus (19.6 Ma) is the softest of the 14 exoplanets. A unique feature is that Kathiravan, more than all the planets, orbits on its side in its circular orbit. On the way to Sunday, there is a ninety-degree tilt on the axis - that is, to carry it along. It has a much darker core than other gas monsters. Uranus has 27 known moons and emits very little heat as radiation[21]. The largest moon, Titan, is geologically active. Although Neptune is smaller than Uranus, Neptune (30 Ma) has seventeen times the mass of Earth and is more dense. Its endothermic radiation is greater than that of Jupiter and Saturn.[22] Neptune has fourteen known moons. Among them is the large 'Triton' with geological activity. Also hot springs contain liquid nitrogen [23]. Triton is the only moon with a retrograde orbit. Neptune has many asteroids in its orbit. Called Neptune droids, they have acoustic vibrations in perfect one-to-one ratio The region beyond Neptune The region beyond Neptune's orbital path contains the Kuiper Belt and various asteroids, including Pluto. Sometimes it is also called the third part of the radial system. Kuiper Belt The Kuiper belt is a region of icy material. It lies between 30 AU and 50 AU from Katiravan (30AU-50AU). It is made up of tiny particles left over after the formation of the nuclear system. Asteroids such as Pluto, Haumea, and Magmac are located in this region. Everything here is made up of water and frozen, flammable methane and ammonia.

"Constitution of India (English: Constitution of India) is the supreme law of India. The constitution of independent India, the world's largest republic, is the longest constitution in the world. It is a written and enacted constitution, flexible and resilient, federal and unitary, and has many characteristics of responsible government. It includes basic political principles, structure of government institutions, procedures, powers, and structures of fundamental rights, directive principles, and duties of citizens. It is the longest constitution ever written among the nations of the world. It contains a total of 22 sections, 12 tables, 101 amendments, 465 clauses and 117,369 words. Apart from the English version, it also has an official Hindi translation. The work of drafting the Constitution of India was initiated by the First Constituent Assembly of India on 29 August 1947. The completed constitution came into force on 26 January 1950. (The date was chosen to commemorate the attainment of full autonomy on 26 January 1929). It thereby declared India as a unified, self-governing country governed by the democratic principles of a republic. After coming into force, the Constitution of India replaced the Government of India Act, 1935 which was the basic administrative document of the country till then. In 1976 amendments to the Constitution of India declared communalism, secularism and fairness as its principles. India celebrates the adoption of its Constitution on January 26 every year as Republic Day. According to the Constitution of India, India is a federal state. However, the word 'union' is used instead of the word 'federal government' in the Constitution of India. In the preamble of the Constitution of India, India is named as a ""Sovereign, Democratic, Equality, and Independent Republic"" and ""Union of India"". It is intended to give a full understanding of this body of laws, in which the fundamental rights of the citizens of India have been provided at the outset, but fundamental duties have also been created later. Specialties include 'fundamental rights'. While drafting the Constitution of India, elements of constitutions of various countries were taken. Hence the Constitution of India is called the 'Package of Debts'. It inherited 'federalism' from Canada, 'fundamental rights' from the United States of America and fundamental obligations from the then Soviet Union. It got the constitutional amendment system from South Africa and the Rajya Sabha system of appointing MPs from Ireland. History of Constitution of India Most of the Indian subcontinent was under British colonial rule from 1858 to 1947. This period witnessed the gradual rise of the Indian independence movement for independence from foreign rule. In 1934 the demand for a Constituent Assembly for India was raised. Later in 1936 and 1939 these demands were emphasized. Accordingly, the Cripps delegation recommended in March-1942 that a Constituent Assembly be formed. A subsequent Cabinet Delegation (May-1946) recommended the establishment of a Constituent Assembly. Accordingly, the election to the Constituent Assembly was held in July 1946. The Constituent Assembly met in December 1946. Sachidananda Sinha was elected as the temporary chairman of the council on December 09. Then Rajendra Prasad was elected as the Permanent Chairman of the Nirnanya Forum on December-11, 1946. On August 15, 1947, British India was divided into two countries namely Indian Province and Pakistan Province, so the Constituent Assembly had to do the work of making only the constitution for independent India. Constituent Assembly of India The Constituent Assembly is constituted by members of India elected by members elected by the Union and State Legislatures. Jawaharlal Nehru, C Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Sandeep Kumar Patel, Dr. Ambedkar, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Nalini Ranjan Ghosh, and Balwant Singh Mehta were prominent figures in the assembly. There were more than 30 members from the lower classes. Frank Anthony reflected the Anglo Indian society. HP Modi represented the Parsis. The minority committee was chaired by a prominent Christian, Farendra Umar Mukherjee, who represented all Christians except Anglo-Indians. Ari Bahadur Gurung reflected the Gorkha community. Alladi Krishnasamy Iyer, PR Ambedkar, Benegal Narsingh Rao and K.M. Prominent arbitrators like Munshi, Ganesh Mavlankar were members of the legislature. Prominent women members included Sarojini Naidu, Hansa Mehta, Durgabai Deshmukh, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Vijayalakshmi Pandit. Dr. Sachithanandan Sinha was the first President of the Constituent Assembly. Later, Rajendra Prasad was elected as the Speaker of the Assembly. The members of the Constituent Assembly met for the first time on December 9, 1946. Constitution Drafting Committee On August 29, 1947, the Constituent Assembly passed a resolution. According to B to write the Constitution of India. Ira Ambedkar led a constitution drafting committee consisting of seven members including him. B. Ira Ambedkar Gopalsamy Iyengar Alladi Krishnamurthy K. M. Munshi Syed Muhammad Sadullah Madhavarao D. B. It's the hand were members of this group. The Committee submitted its report on February 21, 1948. This report was handed over to the Constituent Assembly on 4th November and was signed by Rajendra Prasad, Chairman of the Constituent Assembly on 26th November 1949. Rajendra Prasad was elected as the first President of independent India at the last meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 24th January. The Constituent Assembly also decided that 26th January will be celebrated as the Republic Day of India in commemoration of the resolution passed by the Indian National Congress in Lahore on 26th January, 1930. The ""Constitution of India Act-1950"" came into force on the Republic Day of India. It contained the founding principles of the Land Act of the Government of India after its independence from British rule. From the day the Constitution came into force, India was removed from British rule. At the 14th August 1947 meeting of the Draft Assembly, a proposal for the creation of various committees was presented. Such committees included Fundamental Rights Committee, Union Power Committee and Union Political Committee. On 29 August 1947, the Drafting Committee was appointed with six members headed by Dr. Ambedkar. A draft of the Constitution was prepared and submitted to the Legislative Council on 4 November 1947. The framers of the Indian Constitution, though adopting many external sources, were very much inspired by the British formal parliamentary democracy. Additionally many principles were adopted from the US Constitution. Among the main branches of government are the principles of separation of powers, Supreme Court procedure, and federal structure. The Legislature met in open public sessions for a total of 166 days, comprising 2 years, 11 months and 18 days, prior to the adoption of the Constitution. After some changes, the 308 members of the Assembly signed both the agreements (Hindi and English) on 24 January 1950. The actual constitution of India was handwritten and decorated by Santiniketan artists including Bukar Rammanohar Sinha and others. Two days later, on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India became law for all Indian states and union territories. The Constitution has undergone several amendments since its promulgation. Implications of Foreign Constitutions Dr. Ambedkar's Law Drafting Committee, in order to draft the Indian Constitution, included in the Indian Constitution drafts relevant to Indian practice from many democratic countries at that time. These include the Government of India Act, 1935, which was brought into force in India in 1935. The Constitution of the Organization in its current form (March,2011), has a total of 24 parts with a preamble, 450 articles, 12 schedules, 2 appendices and 114 amendments to date. Although it has a federalist philosophy, it has a strong unitary bias. Preamble The Preamble to the Constitution of India is the preamble to the Constitution of India.

Among them, the fundamental rights of the Indian citizen, principles of government ethics, executive body of the Union government, state governments and courts are mentioned. The Constitution of India begins with the following Preamble: We, the people of India, having resolved wholeheartedly to establish India as a free, social welfare, non-religious, equal-rights republic, social, economic, and political justice for all its citizens; Freedom of thought, expression, belief, religion and worship, To promote equality in social status and opportunity, and to promote brotherhood among all to preserve the dignity of every man and the unity and integrity of the nation. On this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, in our Constituent Assembly, we hereby enact, give and accept this Charter of Government. Fundamental rights In the first chapter of the Indian constitution, the name of the country, the jurisdiction, and in the second chapter, citizenship is mentioned. Article 12 to Article 35 enumerates the fundamental rights of Indians in the third chapter. Among them: Equal protection for all within India (Article-14) All are equal before the law without distinction (Article-15) Equal Opportunity in Public Employment (Section-16) Abolition of Untouchability (Section-17) Abolition of Titles (Section-18) Seven Freedoms (Articles-19 to 22) Right to Religion (Articles 25-28) Cultural and educational rights of minorities (Articles 29-30) Right to sue in the Supreme Court to protect these rights (Article-32) are important. Fundamental rights are temporarily abrogated during times of crisis. But once the state of emergency is over, the fundamental rights will come into force automatically. Directive Principles of Government The Directive Principles are the principles which the Union and State Governments in India should enact laws for the protection and welfare of the people. This is mentioned in the fourth chapter. Adequate living facilities for all, suitable work for age and work, suitable environment for work, free compulsory education up to workable age, public health, prohibition of alcohol, agricultural development, protection of historical monuments, law and order are some of the principles. All these theories are suggestions; Governments cannot be sued in courts to enforce these. Federal System The Constitution divides powers between the Union Government and the State Governments. It divides the powers of Parliament and State Legislatures into three lists, namely the Union List, the State List and the Concurrent List. Matters like national security, foreign policy, currency supply are reserved in the Union List. State list includes public order, local governments, and some taxes. Parliament has no power to enact laws except in exceptional circumstances. State legislatures and parliaments are empowered to enact laws in the concurrent list of subjects such as education, transport and criminal law. The remaining powers are vested in the Union. For example, there is Parliamentary Democracy The President of the Republic of India is elected by the members of Parliament and state legislatures, not directly by the people. All the administration and laws enacted in the Parliament are executed in his name. But these powers are only nominal and the President has to act only on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. A similar system exists in the states, with directly elected members of the legislature exerting their control over the chief minister and ministers. Independent Judiciary Indian Judiciary can exert its control from Executive to Parliament. Judiciary acts as an interpreter of political meaning. Act as an arbiter in disputes between two states or between a state and the Union Government. Legislation enacted by Parliament and the Legislature is subject to judicial review. The judiciary can declare the law unconstitutional if it feels that it violates the constitutional provisions. Judicial Review of Laws The Constitution of India adopted judicial review from the Constitution of the United States. Judicial review operates under Article 13 of the Court. A judicial constitution indicates that the supreme power of the country and all laws are under its supremacy. Article 13 states, 1. All pre-constitutional laws, in case of conflict with later constitutional provisions, remain inoperative until the provisions of the constitution are modified accordingly. This is known as Tort's principle of ellipsis. 2. In the same manner, laws enacted since the adoption of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly must be compatible with the Constitution, otherwise the laws and amendments are deemed to be void-a-b-initio. Union Government Executive Committee The Union Government will consist of the President, Vice President, Union Cabinet and Parliament. President of India The President of India is the ""Head of the Government of India"" of the Republic of India. He is the Chairman of the Union Executive Committee, the Head of the Federal Administration and the Commander-in-Chief of the three forces of the Indian Army. He is also referred to as 'First Citizen of India'. The Vice President is the second highest office in India, second only to the President. The Deputy President is the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha of the Parliament. However, he does not have the right to vote in the state assembly polls. Because he is not a Rajya Sabha member. However, he may vote when the votes are tied. Union Cabinet Parliament As in the United States and England, the Parliament in India is a fluid body. First Chamber or Lower House or House of the People represents the people. The Second Chamber or Upper House or Council of the States, known as the Second Chamber or Upper House or Council of the States, represents the states of the Union of India and the Union Territories. Apart from this, the President is a part of the Parliament of India. Rajya Sabha The 233 members of the Rajya Sabha are elected by the state and territory legislatures. Another 12 members are appointed by the President. They will serve for six years. One-third of the Rajya Sabha members are elected biennially. Lok Sabha The Lok Sabha consists of 543 members directly elected by the people and two members appointed by the President. Lok Sabha elections are held every five years. Pre-Existing Acts The Acts of the British Parliament pre-1935 also established the office of the Secretary of State for India in England, and Parliament ruled through it. It also established the Office of the Government of India. The Indian Assemblies Act, 1861 provided for executive councils and legislative councils with non-official members. The Indian Assemblies Act, 1892 established the Provincial Legislatures. Increased the powers of the Legislature. Although these laws increased the representation of Indians in government, their power was limited. The role of Indians was further expanded by the Indian Assemblies Act, 1909 and the Government of India Act, 1919. Government of India Act 1935 The provisions of the Government of India Act 1935 were not fully implemented, but had a major impact on the Constitution of India. Many important aspects of the Constitution of independent India were directly taken from this Act. The present Constitution of India derives from the provisions of the Constitution the federal government structure, provincial autonomy, federal legislature and separation of legislative powers within and between the provinces. Cabinet Mission Plan In 1946, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee formed a Cabinet Committee to discuss and decide on the transfer of power from British India to Indian leadership and to grant independence to India under a sovereign form of government as part of the Commonwealth of Nations. This group was called the Cabinet Mission. Elections for 296 reserved seats in the British Indian states were completed in August 1946. The Constituent Assembly of India convened on December 9, 1946 and began the work of framing the new constitution. Indian Independence Act 1947 On July 18, 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence (Independence) Act. It divided British India into two new independent sovereign states - India and Pakistan, to be subordinate to the Commonwealth of Nations until a new constitution was written for them. The Constituent Assembly was bifurcated for individual states and each new assembly was given relevant governmental powers. This Act called for the union of other states ruled by kings under one. The Indian Emancipation Act was repealed when the Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950. India was freed from British rule and became a sovereign democratic republic. 26th November, 1949 is known as National Law Day. Structure of Government The basic form of Union Government envisages as follows ""A democratic administration must address three levels: 1. There should be a stable administration 2. There should be a responsible administration. Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to devise a method to ensure both conditions equally. ..... which is more useful in countries like India than periodical assessment of daily responsibility assessment which is not US style. The draft constitution suggests a parliamentary system that prefers accountability over stability.” According to the procedure laid down in Article 368 to amend the Constitution, Parliament can amend the Constitution. An amendment bill must be passed by both houses of Parliament by a two-thirds majority vote. And some amendments related to the federal constitution must be ratified by the state legislatures by a majority. As of September 2010, 94 of the 108 amendment bills brought before Parliament have been passed into law. However, these issues should be amended as the Constitution takes care of government powers. As a result, the document is revised about twice a year. Usathuni, Tamil Nadu Government website, accessed on 06 April 2012.

"Nanotechnology (Nanotechnology) or microscopic technology is the art of manipulating materials at the atomic, molecular, and supramolecular level. The initial fish technology that is widely known today[1][2] adheres to a few specific technological goals. According to this, microtechnology is the process of manipulating materials precisely at the atomic and molecular scale to make large-scale objects or tools. This is now called molecular fish technology. Later, a more general explanation was given by the US National Fisheries Technology Initiative. Accordingly, microtechnology is defined as a technique capable of handling at least one particle in the range of 1 to 100 nanometers. By this definition the mass of matter is so small that quantum mechanics (quantum mechanics) effects can be seen to play a large role. Hence it can be seen that the definition has shifted from a specific technical target to a research category. Accordingly, today it encompasses all research and technologies that describe the special properties of matter below a certain density. Hence it is now called in the plural as microtechnologies or microscale technologies. Its general attitude is considered to be only size. It has many uses in industry and the military, and world powers are spending billions of silver (thalers) on it. The United States has invested US$3.7 billion through its National Fisheries Initiative; The European Union has invested US$1.2 billion and Japan has invested US$750 million.[3] Microtechnology, defined by particle size, encompasses many fields in science such as surface science, [[organic chemistry, [[molecular biology, semiconductor physics, microchemistry, and molecular engineering.[4] Therefore, the research and applications in this field are diverse, ranging from genetic semiconductor physics to entirely new approaches to molecular self-locking, to the creation of nanomaterials, microtechnology, molecular nanotechnology, and all fields with direct atomic level constraints. Scientists are still debating the future implications of microbead technology. It is capable of developing many new materials and tools for a wide range of microtechnological applications such as micromedicine, microelectronics, bioenergy, and consumer products. In other words, fish technology faces all the problems that new technology poses. It has fish toxicity effects and environmental impacts from fish products.[5] Its impact is also on the global economy and is capable of creating many doomsday scenarios. These concerns are sparking debate among aquaculture proponents and governments around the world about the need to develop specific aquaculture regulations. appearance The seminal debate on fish technology was initiated in 1959 by renowned physicist Richard Peynman in his There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom. In it, he describes the possibilities of direct manipulation of atoms to form material. The term fish technology was first introduced in 1974 by Norio Taniguchi. But then the term was not widely distributed. Fascinated by Beinman's ideas, K. Eric Drexler coined the term nanotechnology in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology. In this, he proposed a concept called fish scale fiction. It is capable of fabricating complex structures of itself and fabricating others through atomic control. In 1986, he co-founded the Moronku Institute of Technology to raise public awareness of micro-technology and to understand the concepts and effects of the technology. Thus, in the 1980s, due to his theoretical works and public works, fish technology emerged and developed as a separate field. A number of microscopic high-level procedures are cited. Purunma's atomic control has attracted the attention of researchers. Two organizational innovations in the 1980s fertilized the field. The first invention, the penetrating electron microscope, was invented in 1981. This led to unprecedented clarity of individual atoms and the bonds between them. Thus, by 1989, it was possible to use this microscope to manipulate individual atoms with success. Gerd Pinniku and Anich Urogirer of the IBM Zurich Laboratory were awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics for their development.[6][7] In the same year, Piniqui, Quevet and Gerber invented the atomic force microscope. The second discovery was the discovery in 1985 of fullerenes, macromolecules known as globules. Ari Croteau, Richard Sumalle, and Robert Kerl were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery.[8][9] C60 These were not originally subsumed within microtechnology but later came into the microtechnology definition after the discovery of graphene tubes called organic microtubes or corrugations. of these. Applications in microelectronics and electronic devices are also evident. In the early 2000s, the field gained attention in development science, politics, and business. It met with much opposition and continued progress. After the government agency's report on microbead technology, controversy arose over the definitions and implications of the technology.[10] There has been a lot of chatter about the applications described by molecular fish technologists. This created a lot of controversy among the public. Drexler and Sumalle joined the debate in 2001 and 2003.[11] Meanwhile, nanoscale technological advances have led to the commercial success of materials. These materials are formed by the mass application of micronutrients and are not subject to atomic control of the material. Examples include the silverfish structure, a solar barrier using non-toxic silver fish particles, the light penetrating solar screen made of fish particles, the organic fiber reinforced with inorganic fish particles, and the anti-fouling fish tubes developed in Tugilia.[12][13] This technology combines particles (fabrics) with different properties. Examples include particles with magnetic, electrostatic or optical properties. Aggregating fish particles increases their engineering strength. For example genetic polymorphisms can be enhanced by aquaculture technology. We can use these instead of rains (metals). Because of this weightless reinforced concrete systems are available. Governments of the world, especially the United States and the European Union, have allocated substantial funds to develop aquaculture scientific research. The United States developed the definition of aquaculture and created the aquaculture industry. This way the funding for this technology is distributed. Europe has developed aquaculture technology through basic programs for research and technological development in Europe. In the mid-2000s, serious scientific attention began to flourish. A number of new projects have emerged that envision a nanotechnology highway,[14][15] which has focused on the precise control of matter at the atomic level, debating current and future opportunities, goals, and applications. This research is being done in many countries including India. This is considered to be next generation technology and the research is being done in a very secretive manner. Basic concepts Microtechnology is the functional systems engineering of the molecular world. It covers ongoing studies and further research proposals. In its truest sense, microtechnology unleashes the expansive ability to build objects from the ground up. Techniques and tools developed today enable such perfect high-performance materials to be made. Nanotechnology Structure Carbon is the main element used in nanotechnology. Kadungari and Vairam are variants of Gaban. Fluorine is the third form of synthetically produced carbon. Carbon Bucky Ball, Carbon Nano Tube, Carbon Nano Blower are some of the products produced by fluorine. Citation Reference Bonett, Jennifer. Nanotechnology, Penn Engineering News (Spring 2004).

"A square is one of the basic geometric shapes. It is a two-dimensional figure with four vertices and four congruent sides. A square is a regular quadrilateral. Basic Facts A square is a polygon with four equilateral sides. In square ABCD A B = B C = C D = A D {\displaystyle AB=BC=CD=AD} All four angles are equal in measure and measure 90 degrees each. ∠ A = ∠ B = ∠ C = ∠ D = 90 {\displaystyle \angle A=\angle B=\angle C=\angle D=90} Baggies. Both diagonals (angle lines) of a square are of equal length. If the length of a side of a square is a, then its perimeter is four times a. Length of Diagonal: Description: Since every angle of a square is a right angle, two adjacent sides and a diagonal form a right triangle. If the side of a square is a and the length of the diagonal is d, then by the Pythagorean theorem: Area of ​​Square The area of ​​a square is given by the sum of the squares of its side measures. For example, if the side of a square is 5 meters, its area is 5 x 5 = 25 square meters. If a square of side length 5 meters is divided into small squares of side length 1 meter, a total of 25 small squares are obtained. In general, the area of ​​a square is a: The area of ​​a square can also be found from the diagonal. If the length d of the diagonal of the square is the area of ​​the axil: If the radius of the circle of the square is R, then the area of ​​the square is: If the incircle radius of the square is r, then the area of ​​the square is: Layer two is called a square in English because layer two is taken as the area of ​​a square. Equations Coordinate distances of the vertices of a square with origin as center and side length 2 units in Cartesian orthogonal system: (±1,±1). The coordinates of the points (xi, yi) in the interior of the square are , , . The equation of this square is: , meaning ""x2 or y2, whichever is greater, has a value of 1."" The radius of the circumcircle of this square is half the length of the diagonal. That is Radius of the circle: . Equation of circuit: x 2 + y 2 = 2. {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=2.} Another equation of the square is: If the center of the square is (a, b) and the horizontal or vertical radius is r, the equation of the square is: | x − a | + | y − b | = r . {\displaystyle \left|x-a\right|+\left|y-b\right|=r.} Properties A square is a special type of diagonal, degree, parallelogram, quadrilateral, and rectangle. So the square also has the properties of these geometric shapes:[1] Opposite sides of a square are parallel and equal. All four angles of a square are equal. (Each is equal to 360°/4 = 90°.) All four sides of a square are equal. Both diagonals are of equal length. Two diagonals of a square are bisectors. Also cuts vertically. The angles of a square are bisected by its diagonals. Other details The length of each of the diagonals of a square is equal to the length of the side of the square 2 {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt {2}}} (nearly 1.414) times. 2 is the first number established as an irrational number . {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt {2}}.} A square can be defined as a parallelogram with diagonals of equal length that bisect the angles. A square can be thought of as a geometric shape that can be a rectangle or a rectangle. The area of ​​a circle (circumference) passing around a square through its four vertices is π as the area of ​​the square / 2 {\displaystyle \pi /2} (nearly 1.571) times. The area of ​​a circle (incircle) drawn inside a square touching its sides is π as the area of ​​the square / 4 {\displaystyle \pi /4} (nearly 0.7854) is doubled. The area of ​​a square is greater than the area of ​​any quadrilateral with the same perimeter as a square.[2] A square is a more symmetrical shape. A square has four axes of reflection symmetry and four axes of rotational symmetry (through 90°, 180°, 270° angular rotations). A symmetric family of squares is a dihedral family (D4). If the sides AB, BC, CD, DA of the square ABCD are touched by the incircle at points E, F, G, H respectively and a point on the incircle is P[3]: 2 ( P H 2 − P E 2 ) = P D 2 − P B 2 . {\displaystyle 2(PH^{2}-PE^{2})=PD^{2}-PB^{2}.} Drawing The following figure shows how to draw a square with only the intercept and straight edge. definition Draw a straight line with straight edge. Draw a circle with center and a given radius at any remaining point on this line. Draw a circle with the distance between the center of the circle and the point of intersection of the circle as the radius and the point of intersection of the circle as the center. Draw a line segment joining the two points where this second circle intersects the first circle. Draw a third circle with the point where this line segment meets the first line as the center and the distance between this point and the center of the first circle as the radius. This circle meets the line segment at two points. If the line drawn joining each of these two points to the center of the first circle is extended on both sides, the four points where the two chords meet the first circle will form a square.

"Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu and the fourth largest city in India. Before 1996, the city was called Madras. Chennai is one of the port cities on the shores of the Bay of Bengal. With a population of around 10 million (one crore), this city is one of the 35 largest cities in the world. Ever since the British set foot in Chennai in the 17th century, Chennai has grown into a major city. Chennai is considered as the gateway to South India. Marina Beach in Chennai is one of the longest beaches in the world. Chennai is the home of the Tamil film industry known as Kollywood. Many sports competitions are also held in Chennai which has many sports arenas. Chennai's economy depends on various industries. It has many sectors like automobiles, information technology, hardware manufacturing, medicine etc. About 35 percent of the country's production of vehicles and vehicle spare parts is based in Chennai. It also ranks second in the country in the IT sector. Chennai was ranked 26th in the New York Times magazine's list of 52 places to visit in the world in 2014[11]. History The city of Chennai has a long history. Chennai is believed to have been an important seat of the Pallava, Chola and Vijayanagara empires from the 1st century onwards. Traders and religious preachers from foreign countries came through Chennai coast. This area was originally a small village called Chennapatnam. It was on the 22nd of August 1639 that this city, which is one of the symbols of the Tamils, came into being. On that day, Franciste and Andrew Cogan of the East India Company along with their assistant Perithimappa bought the site that is now Fort St. George. The town to the north of the fort was called Chennapatnam in honor of Chennappa Nayakkan, the father of Ayyappan and Vengadappan, who sold the place to them. Although the city of Chennai developed only after the British built Fort St. George in 1639[12], the adjoining towns such as Tiruvallikeni, Mylapore, Tiruvottiyur and Thiruvanmiyur are centuries older than that. Mylapore in Chennai was the main port of the Pallava government. One of Jesus' companions, St. Thomas, died in AD. There are those who believe that he preached here from 52 to 70. The Portuguese who came here in the 16th century established a port in 1522 named Xanthom (San Toma - ""Saint Thomas""). Then in 1612, this place was handed over to the Dutch. In 1639, it was chosen as a settlement for the British by Francis Day and Andrew Cogan, agents of the English East India Company. Fort St. George was built a year later. The settlement of the British developed around the fort. The villages of Tiruvallikeni, Purasaivakkam, Egmore and Sethupattu which were adjacent to Chennapatnam were joined to this. In 1522, the Portuguese came here and built St. Thomas Fort. Subsequently, the area came under the control of the Bodhisattvas. Their settlement was established in 1612 in an area called Pulikadu north of present day Chennai. In 1688, Chennai was declared the first city council by King James II. With this, Chennai became the first city in India. Robert Clive of the East India Company used it as a base for his military operations. Later it was named ""Chennai Province"", one of the 4 provinces of the British Indian Settlement. In 1746, the French forces captured Fort St. George and the city of Chennai. In 1749, these came back under British control. After that, the city of Chennai developed a lot. Major cities in India were connected to Chennai by rail. Madras became the capital of Madras Province after the independence of India in 1947. Chennai Province was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1969. The name of the city Madras was also changed to Chennai in 1996. A few years after India's independence, in 1956, when the states were divided linguistically, Chennai became a part of Tamil Nadu and the capital of the state. The Tamil Nadu government changed the name Madras to Chennai in 1966 as it was believed to have been given by the Portuguese. As the British bought Chennai George Fort land from the Venkatapati brothers, the Venkatapati brothers demanded that the city should be called Chennapatnam after their father 'Chenappa Nayak'. Hence the land of Chennai George Fort and its surrounding area is known as Chennai. Chennai was one of the worst hit places in the December 2004 deluge. Geography Located on the southeast coast of India, Chennai is adjacent to the state of Andhra Pradesh in the northeast corner of Tamil Nadu. To the east of Chennai city lies the Bay of Bengal. The area of ​​Chennai city is 174 km². Chennai district, Tiruvallur, and parts of Kanchipuram districts are considered as Chennai metropolitan areas. Mamallapuram, Chengalpattu, Kanchipuram, Sriperumbudur, Arakkonam, Sriharikota are the towns near Chennai city. Chennai is hot and humid throughout the year. The maximum temperature recorded in Chennai was 44.1˚ Celsius, while the minimum temperature was 15.8˚ Celsius. The southeast monsoon and mainly the northeast monsoon bring rain to the city. Rainfall in Chennai is about 1300 mm per year. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Angappa Nayakkan Street was located in the innermost part of the coastal city of Chennai. In later times, the sea absorbed well and settled in its present location.[13][14] Some of the color drawings kept in the museum inside the fort show the waves of the sea very close to the walls of the fort. Rivers Koovam and Adyar flow through the city of Chennai. Water is brought to the city from Puzhal Lake, Cholavaram Lake and Sembarambakkam Lake. Marina Beach in Chennai is the second largest beach in the world. 13 km This long beach is divided into three parts. The area north of the Marina beach where it meets the Couvam Sea is known as the Marina Beach, the area north of where it meets the Adyar Sea is called Santhom Beach, and the area south of the Adyar is called Elliott or Besant Nagar Beach.

"A solar system or solar system is a system formed by the gravitational binding between a star and the surrounding matter. It is defined by the Universal Astronomical Union as consisting of eight planets orbiting the Sun and five asteroids. This system includes large planets orbiting directly around the halo, smaller asteroids and small haloes, and satellites orbiting indirectly around the halo. The radial system formed due to the gravitational contraction of a massive molecular cloud 4.6 billion years ago. The radiator itself carries most of the weight of the system. The next most massive planet is Jupiter. The four planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are known as terrestrial planets. These are usually formed of rocks and metals. The other four exoplanets are more massive than the terrestrial planets. Among them, the largest planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are known as warm giants because they contain mostly hydrogen and helium, while Uranus and Neptune are called cold giants because they contain high-melting-point materials such as methane and ammonia. All move around Katiravan in separate orbital paths. The radial system also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, consists mostly of metals and elements like the inner planets, in which the asteroid Ceres is located. The icy Kuiper Belt lies in Neptune's orbit. It contains the asteroids Pluto, Aumia, MacMac and Aries. Apart from these two areas, various small items also travel unhindered. Satellites orbit six planets, at least four asteroids and many smaller objects. These are also called moons. Each of the exoplanets is surrounded by a planetary ring of dust and debris. The star system is located in Orion's arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION For thousands of years mankind did not understand or accept the radiation system. They believed that the earth was stationary and at the center of the universe. They believed that the earth belonged to a different category than the divine objects traveling through the visible air. Both the Indian mathematician and astronomer Areopatta and the Greek philosopher Aristotle reordered the cosmos [5] as research speculation. A scholar named Arichutarkasu hypothesized a system centered on Katiravana. However, it was Nicolaus Copernicus who mathematically declared that the Sun is at the center of the Sun system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei discovered that Jupiter had a globule and four moons orbiting it. Following up on his discoveries, Christian Aixens found a moon called Titan orbiting Saturn and a ring of planets around Saturn. In 1705 Edmund Ely realized that a comet returns to the same object every 74-75 years. This was the first evidence that objects other than planets exist in the solar system. In 1838, Friedrich Bessel was the first to find a reliable distance between a star and another star through parallax error. The subsequent development of observational astronomy and unmanned spacecraft enabled detailed studies of the solar system. System An astronomical unit is the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Kathiravan Kathiravan is a galaxy in the center of the Kathirava system. Its mass (332,900 Earth masses) accounts for 99.86 percent of the total mass of the solar system. It emits huge amounts of energy by fusing its internal hydrogen atoms with helium. That energy is mostly radiated into space through electromagnetic radiation. Katiravan is a G-type main sequence galaxy. With an absolute magnitude of +4.83, Kathiravan is more luminous than about 85% of the galaxies in the Milky Way. Most of those constellations are constellations. Kathiravan belongs to a metal-rich type of galaxy. The inner part of the solar system consists of four exoplanets or planetary bodies that are densely packed with rocks. Two of them have separate moons. They do not have planetary rings. They mostly contain high melting point metals like sand salts on the outside and metals like iron and nickel in the core. Of the four planets, Venus, Earth and Mars are surrounded by rigid spheres. These are characterized by impressive volcanic ridges and architecturally elegant surfaces. It has rifts and volcanoes. The name subplanet should not be confused with the name inferior planet. Inferior planets are Mercury and Venus, which are closer to the Sun than Earth. Mercury Mercury is the closest planet to the Milky Way and the smallest of the planets in the Milky Way. It is at a distance of 0.4 AU from Katiravan. It has no natural satellites. It is famous for its geological features. Hanging craters are located in pressurized volcanoes. They were probably formed by condensation that occurred during the formation of the ocean [6]. Mercury's atmosphere is negligible. The atoms in it explode on the surface when struck by the radiant wind [7]. It is rich in ferrous metal in the core. Its thin 'mist' has not yet been explained. Tentative theories suggest that its outer layers have been completely stripped away by the impact, or that the energy of the young star has prevented it from accreting.[8][9] Venus Venus is a planet similar in size to Earth. It is at a distance of 0.7 AU from the radius. Like Earth, it has a thick mantle of sandy soil (silicate) around an iron core. It has an atmosphere nine times denser and drier than Earth's. It has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet. Its surface temperature can easily reach 400 °C. This is due to its atmosphere being rich in Pingudil [10]. Current geological activities have not yielded any conclusive evidence of geological activity there. It has no magnetic field to prevent its atmosphere from draining away. Hence its atmosphere is continuously replenished by volcanic emissions [11]. Earth is the largest and densest of the Earth (1 Ma). It is only in this that geological activities continue. Only one planet in the universe has living organisms.[12][12][12][12][12][12][12][12][12][8][7] It is the only terrestrial planet to have a liquid hydrosphere. This feature is unique to this one. And the 'Ndathattu' mechanism found in Earth adds to its uniqueness. Earth's atmosphere is different from the atmospheres of other planets. Such differences arise because oxygen contains 21 percent of the oxygen that organisms need to survive [13]. It has only one natural satellite, the Moon. The moon itself is known as the largest of the satellites of the terrestrial planets in the solar system. Mars Mars (1.5 Ma) is a smaller planet than both Earth and Venus. Its atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide. It also features sprawling volcanoes like 'Olympus Mans' and rift valleys like 'Vallis Marinaris'. They highlight its geographical activities.[14] Its red color is due to the iron oxides [15] it contains. Mars has two small natural satellites. They are called 'Timos' and 'Phobos'.[16][17] Outer Galactic System The outer Galactic System is home to gas giants and their satellites. Many short-lived comets (including the constellations called 'centaurs') orbit. They are filled with rapidly evaporating water, ammonia, and methane because they are located at great distances outwards from the sun. But rocks in the inner core remain solid when cold. Outer Planets There are four outer planets or giant planets in the solar system. Together they orbit Katiravan's circular path with 99 percent accuracy. Jupiter and Saturn have maximum hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune have the most ice. Astronomers therefore classify these separately as 'ice monsters'.[18] All four planets have rings, although only Saturn's rings are easily visible from Earth. Jupiter Jupiter (5.2 Ma) is a planet with 318 times the mass of Earth. That is 2.5 times more than the total mass of other planets. It is formed by both hydra and ileum. Its powerful internal heat has given rise to several permanent features known as the atmosphere, the Milky Way, and the 'Great Red Spot'. Jupiter has sixty-three known moons. Four of its largest moons, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, resemble terrestrial planets. Similar features can be seen in both volcanism and internal heating.[19] The 'Kanimedu' moon is larger than Mercury in the radial system. Saturn Saturn (9.5 Va) has similar features to Jupiter, known for its rings, in its spheroid and magnetosphere. Saturn has 60 percent of Jupiter's volume. But it is third in terms of mass. Saturn is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water. It has 60 known satellites. Among them, the moons 'Titan' and 'Enceladus' have been found to have geological activity. More ice though! [20] Titan, the second largest moon in the solar system, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere. Uranus Uranus (19.6 Ma) is the softest of the 14 exoplanets. A unique feature is that Kathiravan, more than all the planets, orbits on its side in its circular orbit. On the way to Sunday, there is a ninety-degree tilt on the axis - that is, to carry it along. It has a much darker core than other gas monsters. Uranus has 27 known moons and emits very little heat as radiation[21]. The largest moon, Titan, is geologically active. Although Neptune is smaller than Uranus, Neptune (30 Ma) has seventeen times the mass of Earth and is more dense. Its endothermic radiation is greater than that of Jupiter and Saturn.[22] Neptune has fourteen known moons. Among them is the large 'Triton' with geological activity. Also hot springs contain liquid nitrogen [23]. Triton is the only moon with a retrograde orbit. Neptune has many asteroids in its orbit. Called Neptune droids, they have acoustic vibrations in perfect one-to-one ratio The region beyond Neptune The region beyond Neptune's orbital path contains the Kuiper Belt and various asteroids, including Pluto. Sometimes it is also called the third part of the radial system. Kuiper Belt The Kuiper belt is a region of icy material. It lies between 30 AU and 50 AU from Katiravan (30AU-50AU). It is made up of tiny particles left over after the formation of the nuclear system. Asteroids such as Pluto, Haumea, and Magmac are located in this region. Everything here is made up of water and frozen, flammable methane and ammonia.

"Louis Braille (January 4, 1809 – January 6, 1852, France) was the inventor of Braille for the blind. He is French and blind. He invented the Braille script which was readable by the blind. In Braille, letters written with one to six dots and holes are recognized by rubbing with fingers. Youth Louis Braille accidentally injured an eye when he was three years old while playing with a sewing needle; Due to lack of proper treatment, he had to lose his eye. He also lost his other eye due to sympathetic ophthalmia. Specialties The method of education for the blind that he discovered is a very helpful and easy method for the audience. For this, many countries around the world have honored him by issuing postage stamps and commemorative coins. The Government of India also honored him by issuing a commemorative coin of 2 rupees engraved with his image.

"Copper is a metallic element. This element is known by other names as Sembu and Tamiram. Its molecular formula is Cu. Its atomic number is 29. Copper is very soft, malleable, ductile, and has very high thermal and electrical conductivity. It is also called Sembon because the fresh surface of this rain is red in color. People use copper as a conductor to conduct heat and electricity. Copper is used as a construction material and as a constituent of various alloys, in the manufacture of coins and in the manufacture of thermocouples and thermocouples. Copper occurs as a single metal in nature. It is available directly from the ore without the need for extraction. It can also be extracted from its minerals very easily. Thus, people knew about copper from five thousand years ago. As early as 3500 years ago, people knew how to use copper to make an alloy called bronze [5]. During the Roman period, copper was mined on the island of Cyprus. The word Aesu Cyprium, meaning the metal of Cyprus, later became Kubram. From this came the English word Copper, the French word Giuwer, the Dutch word Gober, and the German word Kupper [6]. Generally copper(II) salts are widely available. They are found in blue or green colors in minerals like azurite, malachite and turquoise. Historically they have also been used as pigments. Its oxides are used for roofing of houses and for cow dung. Elemental copper is sometimes used as a decorative art material, and its compounds are used as pigments, antibacterials, fungicides, and wood preservatives. Copper is an essential element for all living organisms. Because trace amounts of copper are among the minerals in the food list, it is an essential mineral. Copper is an important component of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In the gums and ankles, copper is a component of the blood pigment amocyanin. Iron in the blood enzyme hemoglobin in fish and vertebrates is here replaced by copper. In humans, copper is found in the liver, muscles, and bones [7]. A well-developed human body contains 1.4 to 2.1 mg of copper per kilogram of body weight [8]. Copper is found in isolated form in the Mexican state of the United States, in some places in Russia, in the southern parts of Australia, and in the country of Bolivia. Along with metals and alloys, copper is also found as a variety of minerals. Copper is found in Singhbum district of Bihar state in India. Cuprite, malachite, azurite, chalcopyrite, tenorite, bornite are some of the important minerals. Properties Physical properties Elements like copper, silver and gold are included in the 11th block of the periodic table. All three elements occupy the top row with an Ez orbital filled with an electron and a d electron nest. They are hard, malleable and ductile. These metals are good conductors of electricity and heat. These elements, which are filled with D-nests, contribute little to intermolecular interactions. Among these E-electrons dominate through metallic bonding. Unlike elements where d-shells are not filled, the metallic bonds in copper are less covalent and relatively less strong. This is the reason for the high ductility and low hardness of copper [9]. The hardness of a crystal matrix increases when it introduces extended defects, such as the crystal boundaries, flow of materials under pressure, and so on. For this reason, copper is usually dispensed as microcrystalline powder. The polycrystalline form is more robust than the singleton [10]. . Its ductility partly explains copper's high electrical conductivity (59.6×106 V/m) and high thermal conductivity. At room temperature, pure metals exhibit this property with silver leading and copper second [11]. This is because the resistance to electron transport at room temperature arises from scattering of electrons by thermal vibrations of the matrix. This resistance is weak in soft metals [9] The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.[12]. The maximum atomic electric density in copper is approximately 3.1×106 A/m2 for its cross-sectional area. Above this, the copper heats up [13]. Copper is one of the few naturally occurring color elements other than gray or silver [14]. Copper in pure form is orange-red in color. Fade to red when exposed to air. The exchange of electrons between the filled 3d and half filled 4z atomic shells is the reason for copper's unique color. The energy difference between these two cells causes the orange light. Galvanic corrosion occurs when copper is combined with other metals [15]. Chemical Properties Copper does not react with water. But it reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form a dark brown copper oxide layer. Unlike iron rusting in wet air, this coating protects the copper from further corrosion. A greenish layer of copper carbonate can be seen as copper indigo, often on the roofs of ancient buildings [17] such as the Statue of Liberty [16]. Faded copper reacts with certain sulfur compounds to form copper sulfides [18]. Isotopes Copper metal has 29 isotopes. 63Cu and 65Cu isotopes are stable. The 63Cu isotope makes up approximately 69% of naturally occurring copper. Both are 3⁄2. are cyclic [19]. All other isotopes are radioactive. Of these, the 67Cu isotope is the most stable isotope with a half-life of 61.83 hours. Seven isotopes have been identified as minor isotopes [19]. Among these, the 68mCu isotope has been stable for the longest time, 3.8 minutes. Isotopes with atomic mass greater than 64 decay to β−, while isotopes less than 64 decay to β+. The isotope with a half-life of 12.7 hours decays by both methods [20]. Both the 62Cu and 64Cu isotopes have significant applications. 62Cu isotope is used as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography in 62Cu-PTSM (copper-pyruvaldehyde-pisu(n4-methylthiosemicarbazone))[21]. தோற்றம் பெரிய நட்சத்திரங்களில் தாமிரம் காணப்படுகிறது[22].புவியின் மேலோட்டில் மில்லியனுக்கு 50 பகுதிகள் என்ற அளவில் தாமிரம் காணப்படுகிறது[23]. இயற்கையில் இது சால்கோபைரைட்டு, சால்கோசைட்டு என்ற தாமிர சல்பைடாகவும், அசூரைட்டு, மாலகைட்டு என்ற தாமிர கார்பனேட்டுகளாகவும், குப்ரைட்டு என்ற தாமிர(1) ஆக்சைடு சேர்மமாகவும் தாமிரம் காணப்படுகிறது[11]. அமெரிக்காவிலுள்ள மிச்சிகன் [23] மாநிலத்தில் உள்ள கீவீனாவ் தீபகற்பத்தில் 420 டன்கள் எடையுள்ள தனிமநிலை தாமிரம் 1857 இல் கண்டறியப்பட்டது. 4.4×3.2×3.2 செ.மீ அளவுள்ள மிகப்பெரிய ஒற்றைப் படிகத்துடன் பல்படிகமாக இயற்கைத்தாமிரம் விவரிக்கப்படுகிறது[24]. உற்பத்தி அதிக அளவிலான தாமிரம் தாமிர சல்பைடுகளாக வெட்டியெடுக்கப்படுகிறது அல்லது பிரித்து எடுக்கப்படுகிறது. 0.4 முதல் 1.0% தாமிரத்தைக் கொண்ட கலவைப் பாறை படிவுகள் திறந்தவெளி பள்ளங்களில் இவை வெட்டப்படுகின்றன. சிலி நாட்டிலுள்ள சுகுயிகாமட்டா, அமெரிக்காவின் யூட்டா மாநிலத்திலுள்ள பிங்காம் கேன்யோன் சுரங்கம், புது மெக்சிகோவிலுள்ள எல் சினோ சுரங்கம் போன்ற தளங்களில் இம்முறையில் தாமிரம் கிடைக்கிறது. பிரித்தானிய நிலவியல் அளவைத் துறையின் 2005 ஆம் ஆண்டு கருத்துப்படி, தாமிர உற்பத்தியில் சிலி உலகின் மூன்றாவது பெரிய நாடாக திகழ்கிறது. அமெரிக்கா, இந்தோனேசியா மற்றும் பெரு [11] ஆகிய நாடுகளைத் தொடர்ந்து உலக மொத்த தாமிரத் தயாரிப்பில் மூன்றில் ஒரு பங்கை சிலி நாடு உற்பத்தி செய்கிறது. கள ஊடுறுவல் செயல்முறையிலும் தாமிரம் நிலத்திலிருந்து தயாரிக்கப்படுகிறது. அரிசோனா மாநிலத்தின் பல தளங்களில் இம்முறையில் தாமிரம் பிரித்தெடுக்கப்படுகிறது [25]. பயன்பாட்டில் தாமிரத்தின் அளவு அதிகரித்து வந்தாலும், அனைத்து நாடுகளும் பயன்படுத்தக் கூடிய வகையில், உலக அளவிலான பயன்பாட்டை அனுமதிக்கும் அளவுக்கு தாமிரம் தயாரிக்கப்பட்டு வருகிறது [26]. காப்பு இருப்பு குறைந்த பட்சம் 10,000 ஆண்டுகளாக தாமிரம் பயன்படுத்தப்பட்டு வருகிறது, ஆனால் பயன்படுத்தப்பட்ட தாமிரத்தின் அளவில் 95% தாமிரம் 1900 ஆம் ஆண்டுக்கு பின்னரே வெட்டி எடுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. அதிலும் குறிப்பாக பாதிக்கு மேலான தாமிரம் கடந்த 24 ஆண்டுகளில் வெட்டப்பட்டுள்ளது. பல இயற்கை வளங்களைப் போலவே, பூமியிலுள்ள செப்பின் அளவும் மொத்தத்தில் பரவலாக உள்ளது, பூமியின் மேற்பரப்பில் சில கிலோமீட்டருக்கு அடியில் 1014 டன் அளவுக்கும் அதிகமாக புதைந்துள்ளது. தற்போதைய வெட்டியெடுக்கும் விகிதத்தில் நோக்கினால் ஏராளமான மதிப்புள்ள தாமிரம் இருப்பில் இருப்பதாக மதிப்பிடப்பட்டுள்ளது [27]. இருப்பினும், இந்த இருப்புக்களின் ஒரு சிறிய பகுதி மட்டுமே இன்றைய விலை மற்றும் தொழில்நுட்பங்களுக்கு ஏற்ற வகையில் பொருளாதார ரீதியாக வெட்டியெடுப்பது சாத்தியமாக உள்ளது. வளர்ச்சிக்கு ஏற்ப மேலும் 25 முதல் 60 ஆண்டுகளுக்கு வெட்டி எடுக்கும் அளவுக்கு தாமிரத்தின் இருப்பு உள்ளதாக மதிப்பிடப்பட்டுள்ளது. மறுசுழற்சி முறையில் தாமிரம் தயாரிப்பது நவீன உலகில் ஒரு பெரும் மூலமாக கருதப்படுகிறது.[28]. இவ்வகையான மற்றும் பிற காரணிகளின் காரணமாக, தாமிர உற்பத்தி மற்றும் விநியோகித்தல் என்பது விவாதத்திற்கு உட்படுகிறது. உச்ச எண்ணெய் தத்துவத்தை ஒத்த உச்ச தாமிரம் உள்ளிட்ட தத்துவமும் இவ்விவாதத்தில் இடம் பெறுகிறது. வரலாற்றில் தாமிரத்தின் விலை நிலையாக இல்லாமல் அவ்வப்போது மாறுபட்டு வருகிறது. [29].[30].[31] Preparation Methods The average concentration of copper in ores is only 0.6%. Most commercially important copper ores are sulfides. In particular, the mineral chalcopyrite (Cu2S) is a sulfide mineral [32]. 10–15% of copper is extracted from finely ground ore by biological separation methods other than foaming [33]. In this process silica is added to separated copper and heated. Iron impurities are removed by converting sulfides to oxides. Silica sludge floating on top is also removed. All sulfides are converted to oxides by roasting the remaining mixture:[32] 2 Cu2S + 3 O2 → 2 Cu2O + 2 SO2 Cuprous oxide is heated to form copper. 2 Cu2O → 4 Cu + O2. The sulfide that is not oxidized in this process uses the oxide formed to oxidize all of the sulfur. It is then extracted into copper by electrolysis. When natural gas is passed through lump copper, the oxidation is completely removed and pure copper is obtained: Cu2+ + 2 e− → Cu. Recycling Copper, like aluminum metal, can be recycled. Almost 80 percent of the copper ever produced is still in use today[34]. According to the International Metal Resource Resource Institute, the global per capita value of copper consumed by society is 35-55 kg. It is at least 140-300 kg in highly developed countries and 30-40 kg per person in less developed countries. தாமிரத்தை பிரித்தெடுப்பதற்கு பயன்படுத்தப்படும் அதே முறைகளே மறுசுழற்சி செய்யவும் பயன்படுத்தப்படுகின்றன. சேகரிக்கப்பட்ட உயர்-தூய்மையான தாமிர துண்டுகளை உலைகளில் இட்டு உருக்கி, பின்னர் கட்டிகளாகவும் பாளங்களாகவும் தயாரிக்கப்படுகிறது. சேகரிக்கப்பட்ட குறைந்த-தூய்மை தாமிரத்துகள்களை கந்தக அமிலக் குளியல் மூலம் மின்னாற்பகுப்பு செய்து சுத்திகரிக்கப்படுகிறது [35]. உலோகக் கலவைகள் முக்கிய பயன்பாடுகளுடன் கூடிய பல செப்பு உலோகக் கலவைகள் தயாரிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளன,. செம்பு மற்றும் துத்தநாகம் சேர்க்கப்பட்டு தயாரிக்கப்படுவது பித்தளை என்ற உலோகக் கலவை ஆகும். வெண்கலம் பொதுவாக செப்பு-வெள்ளீயம் கலந்து உருவாக்கப்படும் உலோகக் கலவைகளை குறிக்கிறது, ஆனால், அலுமினிய வெண்கலம் போன்ற தாமிர உலோகக் கலவைகள் எதையும் வெண்கலம் என்றே கருதுகிறார்கள். வெள்ளி மற்றும் தங்க அணிகலன்கள் தயாரிப்பில் கடினத்தன்மையையும் உருகுநிலையையும் மாற்ற தாமிரம் ஒரு முக்கியமான பகுதிப் பொருளாக உள்ளது [36]. ஈயம் இல்லாத பற்றவைப்புகளில் வெள்ளீயத்துடன் தாமிரமும் வேறு சில உலோகங்களும் சேர்க்கப்பட்டு பயன்படுத்தப் படுவதுண்டு [37]. தாமிரமும் நிக்கலும் கலந்து தயாரிக்கப்படும் குப்ரோநிக்கல் உலோகக் கலவை நாணயங்கள் தயாரிப்பில் பயன்படுத்தப்படுகிறது. அமெரிக்க நாணயங்கள் 75% தாமிரமும் 25% நிக்கலும் கலந்து தயாரிக்கப்படுகின்றன. 90% தாமிரமும் 10% நிக்கலும் கலந்த உலோகக் கலவை கடல்நீரால் உண்டாகும் அரித்தலை எதிர்க்கும் பொருட்கள் தயாரிப்பில் பயன்படுகின்றன [38], 7% அலுமினியத்துடன் தாமிரம் சேர்த்து தயாரிக்கும் கலவை பொன் நிறத்துடன் அலங்காரங்களுக்குப் பயன்படுத்தப்படுகிறது ref name=emsley/&gt;. 4-10% தங்கம் கலக்கப்பட்டு உருவாக்கப்படும் உலோகக் கலவையை அடர் நீல அல்லது கருப்பு நிற பசுங்களிம்பாக சப்பானில் பயன்படுத்துகிறார்கள் [39]. சேர்மங்கள் தாமிரம் பல்வேறு வகையான ஏராளமான சேர்மங்களை உருவாக்குகிறது, பொதுவாக ஆக்சிசனேற்ற நிலை எண் +1 மற்றும் +2 மதிப்புள்ள சேர்மங்களாக இவை உருவாகின்றன. இவற்றை முறையே குப்ரசு சேர்மங்கள் என்றும் குப்ரிக் சேர்மங்கள் என்றும் அழைக்கிறார்கள்[40]. இரட்டைச் சேர்மங்கள் மற்ற தனிமங்களுடன் சேர்ந்து தாமிரம் இரண்டு தனிமங்கள் கொண்ட எளிய இரட்டை சேர்மங்களாக உருவாகிறது, ஆக்சைடுகள், சல்பைடுகள், ஆலைடுகள் என்பவை முதன்மையான உதாரணங்களாகும். ஆக்சைடுகளில் குப்ரசு ஆக்சைடுகள் மற்றும் குப்ரிக் ஆக்சைடுகள் இரண்டும் அறியப்படுகின்றன. பல்வேறு தாமிர சல்பைடுகளில் தாமிர(1) சல்பைடும் தாமிர(II) சல்பைடும் முக்கியமானவையாகும். குளோரின், புரோமின், அயோடின் தனிமங்களுடன் தாமிரம் சேர்ந்து உருவாகும் குப்ரசு ஆலைடுகள் அறியப்படுகின்றன. தாமிர(II)அயோடைடு தயாரிக்கும் முயற்சியில் தாமிர(I) அயோடைடும் அயோடைடும் மட்டுமே உருவாகின்றன [40] 2 Cu2+ + 4 I− → 2 CuI + I2. = Oxidation compounds Copper combines with ions to form oxidation compounds. In aqueous solutions copper(II) is found as [Cu(H2O)6]2+. This quenching compound exhibits a rapid rate of water exchange (rapid addition and removal of water molecules): Cu2+ + 2 OH− → Cu(OH)2. Aqueous ammonia results in the same precipitate. Upon addition of more ammonia, tetrameridecopper(II) is formed Cu(H2O)4(OH)2 + 4 NH3 → [Cu(H2O)2(NH3)4]2+ + 2 H2O + 2 OH−, Oxo anion scavengers including copper(II) acetate, copper(II) nitrate, and copper(II) carbonate are also formed.

Copper was first used in ancient Britain in the third or second century BC. In North America, copper mines were developed and worked by Native Americans. Copper has been extracted from the site of Isul Royal with ancient stone tools dating between 800 and 1600 AD [68]. Copper technology flourished in South America, particularly in Peru. However, commercial production did not begin until the early 20th century. The cultural contribution of copper was particularly significant in coinage. The Romans used copper bullion as money in the sixth century BC. At first copper was considered as a valuable material and then gradually its form and appearance gained importance. Julius Caesar owned coins made of bronze. While Agathasu Caesar is copper. He used coins made of an alloy of lead and tin. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, Romanians were involved in operations in Spain, Cyprus, and other Central European countries producing up to 15,000 tons of copper per year [69][70]. Copper has been used in the manufacture of surgical instruments in Ayurvedic medicine in ancient India. Similarly, the ancient Egyptians used copper to heal wounds, drink water, and treat headaches and burns. Copper was mined from a mine in Sweden from the 10th century AD until 1992. The mine supplied two-thirds of Europe's copper consumption in the 17th century. It also financed many of the wars fought at the time[71]. The mine was considered the national treasure of Sweden. Copper-plated coins were in issue in Sweden[72]. கூரை வேய்வதற்கும்[17], நாணயமாகவும் டேகியுரியோவகை புகைப்பட நுட்பத்திலும் தாமிரம் பயன்படுத்தப்படுகிறது. சிற்பக்கலையின் மறுமலர்ச்சிக்கும், அமெரிக்காவின் சுதந்திர சிலை உருவாக்கத்திற்கும் தாமிரம் பயன்படுத்தப்பட்டது. கட்டிடக் கலையின் பல்வேறு அம்சங்களில் தாமிரம் பயன்படுத்தப்பட்டது. நீருக்கடியில் கப்பலைப் பாதுகாக்க தாமிர முலாம் பூசுதல் மற்றும் சூழுறையிடல் போன்ற முன்னோடித் திட்டங்களை பிரித்தானிய ஆட்சிக்குழு 18 ஆம் நூற்றாண்டில் செயல்படுத்தியது[73] 1876 இல் முதலாம் மின்முலாம் பூசும் தொழிற்சாலை செருமனியில் தோற்றுவிக்கப்பட்டது[74].. 1830 இல் செருமனி விஞ்ஞானியால் தூள் உலோகவியலும், 1949 இல் பின்லாந்தில் விரைவு உருக்கிப் பிரித்தல் செயல்முறையும் கண்டுபிடிக்கப்பட்டதால் தாமிர உற்பத்தியின் வேகம் மேலும் அதிகரித்தது[75]. நாடுகளிடை தாமிர ஏற்றுமதி நாடுகளின் கழகம் 1967 இல் உருவாக்கப்பட்டது. சிலி, பெரு, சாம்பியா, சாயிர் போன்ற நாடுகள் இதை தொடங்கின. தாமிர உற்பத்தியில் இரண்டாவது பெரிய நாடான அமெரிக்கா இக்கழகத்தில் உறுப்பினராக சேராத காரணத்தால் 1988 இல் கலைக்கப்பட்டது [76]. பயன்பாடுகள் மின்சார கம்பியாக (60%), கூரை மற்றும் குழாயமைத்தல் (20%), மற்றும் தொழில்துறை இயந்திரங்கள் (15%). பித்தளை மற்றும் வெண்கல உலோகக் கலவையாக பயன்படுவது தாமிரத்தின் முக்கியப் பயன்பாடுகள் ஆகும். சமையல் பாத்திரங்கள், கொதிகலன்கள், நீராவிக் குழாய்கள், மின்கம்பி, மின்வடம், மின்வாய், போன்றவைகள் செய்யவும் செம்பு பயன்படுகின்றது. எளிதில் தீப்பற்றிக் கொள்ளும் ஆபத்தான வேதிப் பொருட்களோடு தொடர்புடைய கருவிகள் மற்றும் சாதனங்களுக்கு இரும்பைக் காட்டிலும் செம்பு நற்பயன் அளிக்கிறது. இரும்பைப் பயன்படுத்தும் போது உராய்வினால் ஏற்படும் தீப்பொறி உண்டாக்கும் விபத்து இதனால் தவிர்க்கப்படுகின்றது பெரும்பாலும் தாமிரம் தூயநிலை உலோகமாகவே பயன்படுத்தப்படுகிறது. கடினத்தன்மை மாற்றம் தேவைப்படும் நேரங்களில் மட்டும் கலப்புலோகமாக பயன்படுத்தப்படுகிறது. படகுகளின் அடிப்பகுதியைப் பாதுகாக்க தாமிரச் சாயம் பூசி பாதுகாக்கிறார்கள். உணவு கூட்டுப்பொருளாகவும் பூஞ்சைக் கொல்லியாகவும் விவசாயத்தில் பயன்படுத்தப்படுகிறது [41][77]. மின்கம்பி மற்றும் மின்வடம் செம்பின் மின்கடத்துத் திறன் இரும்பை விட 5 மடங்கும், அலுமினியத்தை விட 1.5 மடங்கும், துத்தநாகத்தை விட 3 மடங்கும், டைட்டானியத்தை விட 35 மடங்கும் அதிகமுள்ளது. இதனால் செம்பு மின்துறை வளர்ச்சியின் நெம்புகோலாக விளங்குகின்றது. பிற தனிமங்களைக் காட்டிலும் தாமிரம் சிறந்த மின்கடத்தியாக தேர்வு செய்யப்பட்டு அனைத்து வகையான மின் விநியோகத்திற்குமான மின் கம்பிகளிலும் பயன்படுத்தப்படுகிறது [78]. தலைக்குமேல் வான்வழியாக செல்லும் மின்கம்பி, மின்சுற்றுகளுக்கு மட்டும்அலுமினியம் கம்பிகள் பயன்படுத்தப்படுகின்றன [79][80]. மாங்கனின், கான்சுடன்டன் போன்ற செம்பின் சில கலப்பு உலோகங்கள் உயர் மின்தடை கொண்டுள்ளன. இவை மின்னுலை, மின்னடுப்பு போன்ற கருவிகளுக்கு மின் கம்பியாகப் பயன் தருகின்றது. மின் மாற்றிகள், மின் மோட்டார்கள், மின்னியற்றிகள், மின் காந்தங்கள் போன்றவைகளுக்கான வரிச் சுற்றுகளுக்கு செம்புக் கம்பி இணக்கமானது. செம்பின் மின்தடை குறைவாக இருப்பதால் வெப்ப இழப்பும் குறைந்து மின்சாரம் கணிசமாக மிச்சமாகின்றது. மின்கருவிகளைக் குளிர்விக்க வேண்டிய அவசியம் ஏற்படுவதில்லை [81]. During a brief period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, the use of copper for electrical distribution in American homes was replaced by aluminum. But the use of aluminum led to many house fires, so they returned to copper [82][83]. Copper acetate is useful for bright green color. Copper is an important raw material for electrochemical cells such as 'Voltamani'. Copper is coated on iron plates as the first stage of electroplating. One of the most favorable sources for electroplating is copper. The electrolytic solution for copper plating can be either alkaline or acidic. In electronic and related devices, integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, etc., copper is used instead of aluminum for its conductivity. Heat sinks and heat exchangers also make use of copper due to its excellent heat dissipation properties. Devices such as electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes, and microwave ovens use copper for microwave radiation [84]. Electric motors The high conductivity of copper increases the efficiency of electric motors [85]. Motors and motor-driven systems account for 43%–46% of all global electricity consumption and 69% of electricity used in power systems [86]. Electric motors are designed with the primary objective of energy storage to maximize motor efficiency [87][88]. The National Electric Manufacturers Association monitors performance standards [89]. Uses of Alloys A wide variety of alloys can be obtained from copper. Bronze is an alloy of copper (99-70%) and tin (1-30%). Sometimes lead or zinc is added to it. It is difficult and easily worded. Hence it is used to make spinning discs, one-way conveyors, mechanical parts, jewellery, metal ornaments, idols, temple bells etc. Silicon bronze mixed with silicon and copper in the ratio of 20:80, aluminum bronze mixed with aluminum and copper with a small amount of silver are used for coins, metal statues and as a solder. These alloys are also used in aircraft engines, rotor fans etc. Copper is also included in many special alloys such as bell alloy brass, gun metal cerumen silver and brass. Brass contains copper and zinc in the ratio of 60-80% and 40-20% respectively. The color also varies from coppery red to golden yellow. If the concentration of zinc is low it is called alpha-alpi and if it is high it is called beta-alpi. It is suitable for workshop purposes and is used for making utensils. Copper has been used since ancient times as an architectural material as a durable, corrosion resistant, and weatherproof roof coating [90][91][92][93]. Architectural materials such as porches, roofs, rain screens, towers, and doors have been made for thousands of years. Copper has expanded into the architectural modern era, including interior and exterior wall cladding, building extensions, connections, radio frequency protection, and attractive handwork, bathroom fixtures, and antimicrobial and decorative interior products. Other important advantages of copper are architectural properties, low thermal conductivity, light weight, lightning protection and recyclability. The unique green color of this world has been loved by designers and architects for a long time. The durable layer of cowhide is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion. This coating continuously protects the metal[94][95][96]. Copper is found as a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in varying amounts depending on environmental conditions such as acid rain containing sulfur[97][98][99][100]. Architectural copper and its alloys are started and finished with a specific look, color and feel. These finishes often include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring and chemical coatings[101]. Copper has excellent welding properties. Gas metal arc ignition is reported to give better results.[102] Antimicrobial benefits Bacteria and many other organisms do not grow on copper. It is for this reason that copper has long been used to protect the bottoms of ships. Copper alloys are used in fishing industry to make fishing nets [103]. Other uses Copper solutions are used for wood preservation. Copper is mixed with some fibers to create antimicrobial materials. Alloys of copper are used in some musical instruments. Copper is used as an alkali in nickel plating. In museums it helps to detect chloride, sulphide, oxide etc. with metals like lead and silver. Copper degradation The spheroidal bacteria and Pseudomonas fluorescens degrade solid copper to copper cyanide [104]. Certain types of fungi grow in copper-rich soils. Some fungi protect young pine trees from copper poisoning [104]. Fungi such as Auspergillus are found in solutions in gold mines. The solution also contains cyano-block compounds of elements such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. These insects dissolve heavy metals [105]. Biological Contribution Copper proteins play a major role in biological electron transport and oxygen transport. They interconvert copper(I) compounds to copper(II) compounds [106][107][108]. [109]. The biological contribution of copper begins with the formation of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere [110]. Copper is essential for aerobic respiration in all eukaryotes in the mitochondria. It is found in cytochrome c oxidase, the last protein in the oxidative dephosphorylation reaction. This protein helps bind oxygen to elements like copper and iron. And this protein transfers eight electrons to the oxygen molecule. Copper, found in many oxides, acts as a catalyst for their decomposition. This decomposition reaction produces oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. 2 HO2 → H2O2 + O2 Among animals, copper is a pigment called emocyanin in the blood of sea creatures such as octopus, squid, oysters, crabs, and snails. It contains 0.33-0.38 % copper. Copper acts on them like iron does on hemoglobin. This pigment acquires a blue color when it combines with oxygen in the follicle zone. This is why snails are said to have blue blood. After giving the absorbed oxygen as energy to the tissues in the body, their blood becomes colorless. Copper is commonly used to make jewelry, and some folk medicine suggests that copper bracelets prevent gout symptoms. However, various studies have not shown that this treatment cures arthritis. There is no medical recommendation that copper has any medicinal properties. Dietary Requirements The average human needs about 0.005 grams of copper per day. Lack of copper can lead to anemia and fatigue. Because of this, many will say that copper has medicinal properties. Copper that is compatible with some organisms is not compatible with others. Copper sulfates are harmful to sharks. This is referred to as anti-shark material. People trapped in the sea use this medicine to escape from sharks. There is no evidence of absorption of copper through the skin. Perhaps so attracted it acts as a toxin [111]. Copper is an essential mineral for all plants and animals, but not all microorganisms require it. The human body contains 1.4 to 2.1 mg of copper per kg of body weight [112]. Copper absorbed by the human body is transported to the liver [113], and copper is transported to various tissues following hepatic processes. Excess copper in the body is excreted by the liver [114][115]. Copper deficiency diseases include anemia, bone abnormalities, seizures, growth retardation, infections, bone motility disorders, and abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism due to copper deficiency. Wilson's disease causes accumulation of copper in body tissues.

"Australia, Australia or Australasia (Australia) is a country that includes the world's smallest continent and the world's largest island, the mainland, the island of Tasmania, and some small islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia. It has no land border with any country. Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea are its neighbors to the north, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia to the north-east and New Zealand to the south-east. History tells us that Aboriginal Australians have lived on the Australian mainland for nearly 42,000 years[1]. After occasional fishermen from the north, and later Dutch explorers from Europe in 1606[2], the British landed in the eastern part of Australia in 1770 and claimed it for the United Kingdom. The colony of New South Wales was created on January 26, 1788, initially as a settlement scheme for English and Scottish convicts. Later, as the population grew, more new areas of Australia were discovered and five more autonomous British colonies were established during the 19th century. On 1 January 1901 the six separate colonies united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, a federal government with an open democratic constitution. Its capital is Canberra. Despite being the sixth largest country by area, it has a population of just 23.2 million (2.32 crore, 2013 estimate[3]). 60 percent of them live in mainland areas around state capitals. Australia follows Western economic systems. Per capita income is on par with strong economies. Only 5% of the workforce is engaged in agriculture. A country rich in oil and minerals. Origin of Name The name Australia is derived from the Latin word Australis. The concept is south. In 1521 the Spaniard became the first European to sail across the Pacific Ocean. The word Australia was first used in the English language in 1625.[4] In 1638 the Dutch East India Company, based in Jakarta, named their new discovery further south Australische. The name ""Australia"" came into widespread use in 1814 when Matthew Flinders, the first British sailor to circumnavigate Australia, used the name ""Australia"" in his book A Voyage to Terra Australis. New South Wales Governor Lachlan Macquarie recommended the name to the colonial government on 12 December 1817[5]. The name was adopted in 1824. In Australian English ""Australia"" is pronounced as əˈstɹæɪljə, -liːə, -jə[6]. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Australia has been referred to locally and internationally as Oz and Australians as Aussie. History Australian Aborigines Studies date the first human settlement of Australia between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago [7]. They are now known as the ancestors of the tribes in Australia. Evidence has been confirmed that they were at Laje Mungo in New South Wales. Although inhabited by humans since before the Stone Age, they are believed to have separated from the present-day Southeast Asian islands very early. Genetically and linguistically, the relationship and relationship of these tribes (with other nationalities) is not confirmed. Majority of these tribes are hunter-gatherers. Melanesians are a tribe living in far-north Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands. Their culture and lifestyle are different from other tribes. Arrival of the European The first European to reach the Australian mainland was the Dutch sailor Willem Jansoon. He sighted the shores of Cape York Peninsula in 1606. During the 17th century the Dutch settled on the western and northern shores and named the area Nova Hollandia. But they did not try to settle there. In 1770, English Captain James Cook during his Pacific voyage landed on the east coast of Australia and claimed it for Great Britain, naming it New South Wales. His discoveries later led to British convict settlement there. The monarchical colony of New South Wales was founded on January 26, 1788 in Jackson's Department by Arthur Phillip. This day was later named Australia Day as Australia's national day. Settlement in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania) began in 1803 and became a separate colony in 1825.[8] The western part of Australia (the Swan River Settlement) was officially claimed by the United Kingdom in 1829. In 1832 the region became known as Western Australia. The separate colonies of South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859 were separated from New South Wales. In 1911, the Northern Territory separated from South Australia and became a separate state. South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia did not begin as British convict settlements. However, Victoria and Western Australia later began accepting convicts[9] and sent convicts to New South Wales was stopped in 1848 after opposition from settlers.[10] When Europeans first settled here in 1788, approximately 350,000 tribes lived on the continent[11]. At that time 500 types of tribes were living in this continent with their own language. Their numbers began to decline drastically over the next 150 years. Infectious disease, forced resettlement, cultural adjustment etc. are considered to be the main reasons for this [12]. Researchers believe that forced eviction of tribal children from their families is also the reason for this decline [13]. Following a referendum in 1967, the central government was empowered to make policy changes and enact new laws regarding tribals. Native title was not recognized in Australia until 1992. Following the famous Mabo v Queensland case heard in the High Court of Australia, lands under European occupation were previously considered terra nullius (""empty land"") and land titles were given to those who had held the land for generations. Federation During the period 1855 - 1890, the six colonies formed their own governments and began to look after their own local affairs as if they were within the British Empire. The colonial administration based in London was particularly concerned with foreign affairs, defense and international shipping. On 1 January 1901, the Australian Confederation was established. A ""Commonwealth of Australia"" was born within the British Empire. In 1911, part of the state of New South Wales was separated into a separate territory called the Australian Capital Territory, and the capital of the federation, Canberra, was established here in 1927. Until then Melbourne was the temporary capital of the Confederation. The Northern Territory, which was part of South Australia, was separated in 1911 and brought under Central Government. Australia entered the war voluntarily in World War I[14]. Australian participation in the Battle of Gallipoli was the country's first major military engagement. Despite their defeat, the move is seen by most Australians as a national uprising. In the United Kingdom, the Act of Westminster 1931, enacted in 1931, maintained the constitutional relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom, but a 1942 bye-law ended the 1931 Act. The United Kingdom's shocking defeats in Asia during World War II in 1942 and the collapse of the Japanese Empire provided Australia with an opportunity to align with the United States. Since 1951, Australia has had a defense treaty with the United States called Ansus. After the Second World War, people from Europe were allowed to settle in Australia. People from Asia and non-European countries were encouraged to immigrate here from the 1970s after the end of the White Australia policy. After this there was a great change in the heritage, culture, and self-determination of the people of Australia. The constitutional link between Australia and the United Kingdom was further split in 1986 following the passage of the Australia Act 1986. After this act was passed, Britain's role in the Australian states came to an end. An appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom was barred[15]. In a 1999 referendum on Australia becoming a republic, 54 percent voted against. Political Commonwealth Australia is a parliamentary democracy with a middle-class government. Elizabeth II is Queen of Australia. In the interim rule, the Queen has appointed a Governor-General and separate Governors for the respective states on her behalf. Although the Governor-General has many executive powers under the Constitution, he usually exercises his powers on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia. Only once, in 1975, did the Governor-General arbitrarily remove the then Whitlam government[16]. A total of three governmental bodies operate in Australia: Legislature: Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Governor, Senate and People's Representatives are part of it. The Governor-General participates on behalf of the Governor. Executive Council: The Central Executive Council consists of the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet. Law: High Court and Arbitral Tribunals of Australia. Appeals to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom ceased in 1986. The bicameral Parliament of Australia consists of 76 members in the Senate (upper) and 150 members in the House of Representatives (lower). Below Members One member is elected from each constituency. The Upper House has 12 members from each state, two from each of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Elections to both houses are held once in three years. The party with the lowest number of members forms the government. Its leader is elected as the Prime Minister. States and Territories Western Australia Northern Territory South Australia Queensland New South Wales Australian Capital Territory Victoria Tasmania Indian Ocean Timor Sea Gulf of Carpentry Arafura Seea Great Australian Bight Tasman Sea Bass Strait Coral Sea ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● South Pacific Ocean Southern Ocean Great Barrier Reef Australia is a self-governing country consisting of six states, two territories and a few other small territories. The states are: New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania. The two main regions are the Northern Region and the Australian Capital Territory. Although the functions of the territories are generally similar to those of the states, the constitution of the territories can be changed by the central government (Australian Government). Whereas the Central Government can only change the provisions of Article 51 (Special) Acts of the State Governments. Hospitals, education, police, law, roads, public transport, local government etc. are under the control of state governments. Each state and territory has its own separate assemblies (parliaments). Among these, the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Queensland have one assembly, while other states have two lower and upper assemblies. The head of government of the states is called the Prime Minister and the head of the regions is called the Chief Minister. The Queen appoints a Governor in each state and an Administrator in the Northern Zone as her representative. There are also some smaller territories in Australia. Jervis Island is a naval base located in the state of New South Wales and is administered by the Commonwealth of Nations. In addition to these, the following territories are controlled by Australia: Norfolk Island Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands Ashmore Cartier Islands Coral Sea Islands Hart Island and Macdonald Islands Australian Antarctic Territory Geography Australia is located on the Indo-Australian Plateau surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans and separated from the Asian continent by the Arabian and Timor seas. Covering an area of ​​7,617,930 square kilometers[17], most of the country is desert. Australia's land mass consists of 34,218 km of coastline (excluding islands)[18]. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest barrier reef[19], is found off the northeast coast of Australia. Its length is more than 2000 km. Mount Augustus in Western Australia is considered the world's largest monolith[20]. At 2,228m, Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain in mainland Australia. Mount Mosan is 2,745 m high in the territory of Hart Island and Macdonald Islands off the Peruvian mainland. Australia is the flattest continent. It is the driest of the human-inhabited continents, with old and poor soils. Most Australians live along the southeast coast of the country. The northern part of the country is a tropical region. There are rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, deciduous forests, and deserts. Climate change has become a major issue in Australia in recent times[21]. Although rainfall has increased over the past century[22], much of Australia remains water-scarce. Due to population growth in cities, and local droughts, water restrictions are in effect in many cities[23]. The majority of the population's current (2008) estimated 21.3 million Australians are descendants of people who came from Europe during the colonial and pre-federal period. Most of them are immigrants from the British Isles. Even today, the majority of Australians are of British and Irish descent. Australia's population has quadrupled since the First World War[25]. This strengthened the support for the immigration plan. After World War II, and from then until 2000, nearly 5.9 million people immigrated. That means almost two in seven Australians are foreign-born[26]. Most of the immigrants were skilled in some field[27], although family members and refugees were allowed to immigrate.[27] According to a 2001 estimate, the majority of foreign-born were born in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Vietnam, and China[28]. After the abandonment of the White Australia policy in 1973, several programs were introduced at the government level to promote inter-racial unity based on multiculturalism[29]. In 2005–06, more than 131,000 people immigrated to Australia. The majority of these are from Asia and the changing Oceania regions[30]. In 2006–07 the number of immigrants was estimated at 144,000[31]. 300,000 people are planned to be accommodated during 2008-9. This is the largest number of immigrants since World War II[32]. In 2001 the number of Aboriginal people in mainland Australia (Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) was 410,003. This is 2.2% of the country's total. This is 115,953 more than in 1976. Arrests, unemployment, illiteracy, etc. are the problems faced by the Australian aborigines. Their average life expectancy is up to 17 years shorter than other non-Indigenous Australians[33]. As in other developed countries, Australia's population appears to be aging. More are seen as retirees and a smaller proportion as professionals. The median age of the population in 2004 was 38.8 years[34]. A large number of Australians (759,849 in 2002–03)[35] lived outside their country of birth. vt Largest populated areas in Australia 2019 data from Australian Bureau of Statistics[36] Rank Name State Pop.

The majority speak Australian English. It resembles British English but has some pronunciation and vocabulary unique to Australians. Grammar and spelling are similar to British English. According to a 2001 survey, English was the language spoken at home by 80 percent. followed by Chinese (2.1%), Italian (1.9%), and Greek (1.4%). The majority of immigrants here are bilingual. Around 200 or 300 language-speaking tribes are believed to have lived here at the time of European settlement. Only 70 of these are in the case today. Almost 50,000 (0.25%) people have an indigenous language as their first language. Religion There is no official religion in Australia. According to a 2006 survey, 64% of Australians identified themselves as Christian. Of these, 26% follow Roman Catholicism and 19% follow Anglicanism. 19% identified as not belonging to our religion. 12% did not identify themselves religiously. Christians are followed by 2.1% Buddhists, 1.7% Muslims, 0.8% Hindus and 0.5% Jews. Less than 6% of the total are non-Christian[38]. As in other Western countries, there are few people who go to Christian churches. 1.5 million people attend churches weekly. This is 7.5% of the total population[39]. Education In Australia, schooling is compulsory from age 6 to age 15 (age 16 in South Australia, age 17 in Western Australia, and age 17 in Queensland). This puts the adult literacy rate at 99%. Australia's education system currently ranks eighth in the world[40]. There are a total of 38 state universities here. Besides, there are many private universities which are running on government subsidy. More than these, government technical colleges are running in these states. Education for various industries and professionals is provided here. 58% of Australians aged 25 to 65 have industrial or tertiary qualifications[33]. According to Health 2006 data, the average life expectancy of Australians is 78.7 years for men and 83.5 years for women[41]. Australia has the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world,[42] while tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of death and disease[43]. Australia has the highest prevalence of obesity among developed countries[44]; Meanwhile, Australia is one of the countries that has successfully prevented the spread of AIDS[45][46]. Australian Tamils ​​Tamils ​​began to migrate to Australia from the 1970s. Before that some people have come with work permit. Government estimates indicate that a total of 162 Tamils ​​immigrated to Australia before 1971[47]. The first Tamil to migrate to Australia was Kamal K. Kamaleswaran. The number of Tamil Australians increased from 202 in 1971 to 11,376 in 1991. 60 percent of them are Eelam Tamils. According to government census, the number of Tamils ​​increased to 18,690 in 1996 and 24,067 in 2001[48]. More than 50 percent of them live in the state of New South Wales. Rather than Sri Lanka, they migrated to Australia from countries like India, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, and Fiji in anticipation of opportunities. Culture From 1788, Australia's culture was essentially Anglo-Celtic. However, the natural environment, and the culture of the tribes defined some of Australia's unique cultures. Since the mid-20th century, Australian culture has been heavily influenced by American popular culture (especially television and film), Australia's neighboring Asian countries, and immigration from non-English-speaking countries. The history of Australian painting begins with Aboriginal cave paintings [49]. Australian Aboriginal heritage has been passed down mostly through oral tradition and rituals. Aboriginal music, dance and painting have greatly influenced contemporary Australian culture. Famous painters like Emily Kingwarei and Gordon Bennett belong to the tribe. The National Gallery of Australia and art galleries in many states have collections of local and foreign paintings. Media Australia operates two public television services (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Multicultural Special Broadcasting Service) and three private television services. There are also many private cable, and many non-profit television services. Each of the state capitals publishes separate newspapers. Two newspapers are published nationally. According to Reporters Without Borders' 2008 report, Australia's media freedom is ranked 25th. New Zealand is ranked 7th and the United States is ranked 48th. Such a low rating for Australia is thought to be due to the fact that most of the press in the country is dependent on two large commercial companies, News Corporation and Joan Fairbox[50]. Sport In Australia 23.5 per cent of over 15s engage in some form of team sport [33]. Australia is internationally renowned for sports such as rowing, hockey, netball, rugby league, and rowing and swimming. The 1956 and 2000 Olympic Games were held in Australia. Australia has been among the top six medal winners since 2000[51]. [52] The Australian Open Grand Slam tournaments are world famous in tennis. Biodiversity Although much of Australia is semi-arid or desert, its habitats range from montane to tropical rainforest. Due to factors such as extreme climatic changes and long periods of geographical isolation, Australia's biota is unique and diverse. 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, 45% of birds and 89% of aquatic species such as fish are unique to Australia[53]. Kangaroo, koala, wallaroo are some of the Australian animals. Australia has the largest number of land animals in the world. There are about 755 species of reptiles[54]. Economy thumbnail|right|Australia's largest gold mine is located in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia The Australian dollar is the currency of Australia. In addition to Australia, it is also the official currency of Christmas Islands, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island, and the Pacific islands of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. Australia has a mixed economic system with Western countries. It was ranked third in the United Nations' 2007 Human Development Index and sixth in The Economist's 2005 World Standard of Living Index. The unemployment rate in Australia in 2007 was 4.6%. GDP is slightly higher than that of the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Also, in The Economist magazine's list of the world's most livable cities (2008), Melbourne was ranked 2nd, Perth 4th, Adelaide 7th, and Sydney 9th [55].

"The Nile (Arabic: النيل‎, An Nile; Ancient Egyptian: Iteru Yifi; Gothic Egyptian: ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲱ, P(h)iaro; Amharic: אבאי?, ʿAbbai) is the most important river in the northeastern African continent. It is also said to be the longest river in the world [1]. With a length of 6650 km, it flows through eleven countries namely Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea[2]. Among these, Egypt and Sudan are the countries that benefit the most from the Nile[3]. The Nile consists of two major tributaries, the White Nile and the Blue Nile. Of these, the White Nile is the longest. It originates from the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. From there it reaches South Sudan through Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Lake Victoria and Uganda. The Blue Nile originates at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows through the southeastern part of Sudan, joining the White Nile near its capital, Khartoum. The northern part of this river, from Sudan to Egypt, flows mostly through the Sahara desert. The region is known for its ancient Egyptian culture and the Nile River Civilization. Many settlements of ancient Egypt were located in this area. Name reason In ancient Egyptian, the Nile River was called Yiphi or Ituru. It means big river. The adjacent figure is an Egyptian hieroglyph used to represent the Nile River. The etymology of its current English pronunciation, Nile, is uncertain. It is believed to be derived from the Semitic word maru (meaning six)[4]. History The Nile River was a major factor in ancient Egyptian civilization. Many important cities of the time were located in the Nile Valley and its estuary. It has been prominent in Egyptian culture since the beginning of the Stone Age. Following a climate change around 3400 BC, drought occurred in many parts of North Africa and the Sahara Desert began to form. During that period, many tribes began to migrate to the Nile Valley region. It was during this period that the world's first village and agricultural society emerged. Yonile The Nile is estimated to be the fifth most evolved river to flow northward from the Ethiopian highlands. This primordial Nile is called Yonile. Its barriers are found in the desert regions west of the present-day Nile. Yonile, 23 - 5.3 million years old. This contributed large amounts of fossiliferous sediments to the Mediterranean Sea. Several natural gas wells have been discovered in this deposit area. Tributaries The drainage area of ​​the Nile River is 3,254,555 sq km. It is 10% of the total area of ​​the African continent. Its major tributaries are the White Nile, the Blue Nile and the Atbara River. White Nile The White Nile is the largest tributary of the Nile River. Its source is Lake Victoria. But some rivers join the lake too. So this is unacceptable. The White Nile is 500 km from Lake Victoria through the Iraiban Falls. Reaching Lake Albert via Yoga Lake takes advantage of the distance. The river in between is called the Victoria Nile. The river that flows out of Lake Albert is called the Albert Nile. After this, the Albert Nile enters South Sudan, where it is known as Baghar al Yabal. It joins another tributary known as Bagh Al Ghazal at Lake No. Bagh Al Ghazal is a river produced in the Saad marshland. Its total length is 716 km. Together, these two rivers form the water that emerges from Lake No, known as the Bagh al Abayat or the White Nile. It got its name because of white clay particles floating in this water [5]. Blue Nile The source of the Blue Nile is Lake Tana in the Ethiopian lowlands. Its total length is 1400 km. It is the most important river in Ethiopia. This river meets 90 percent of Ethiopia's drinking water needs. Also, 96 percent of Ethiopia's waterborne traffic is carried through this waterway [6]. However, the river has a significant flow during the periods of high rainfall in the Ethiopian plateau. At other times its current is very less. Especially at the end of August, the river has a flow of 5663 m3 per second, but at the end of April it has a flow of only 133 m3. Atbara river Like the Blue Nile, the Atbara River originates in Ethiopia's Lake Tana. 800 km from there. This long flowing river is 300 km north of Khartoum city. At a distance it joins the Nile. The Atpara river, which has flow only during the rainy season, is mostly dry during the summer season from January to June. current The flow of the Albert Nile, the approximate origin of the Broad Nile River, is 1048 m3 per second. It has a steady current throughout the year. After this, the Bagh Al Yabal River loses most of its water in the Saat Marshes. Approximately half of its current is accelerated here by evaporation, so at the end of the river its flow decreases from 1048 m3/s to 510 m3/s. The average flow of the White Nile is 924 m3 per second. It reaches a maximum of 1218 m3 per second in early March. The minimum volume is 609 m3 per second. This variation in the course of the White Nile is due to the flooding of a tributary called the Sobad. Of the total flow of the Nile, the share of the White Nile averages 30%. But in summer from January to June it increases to 70% to 90%. This proportional increase occurs because the flow of the Blue Nile during these months is less than 113 m3 per second and the Atbara River is almost dry. The share of the Blue Nile averages 70% of the total Nile flow. The reason for this current difference is due to heavy flooding in this river during the rainy season of August. At these times the flow of the Blue Nile is 5663 m3 per second. It is 50% higher than the conventional current. Before the construction of dams on this river, its flow was still 15% higher. The Blue Nile of those times had a maximum flow of 8212 m3 per second. Minimum size is 552 m3. Estuary The Nile estuary is one of the largest estuaries in the world. It starts in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, on the course of the Nile and ends in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a bow-shaped estuary with a length of 240 km from east to west and 160 km from north to south. Formerly seven branches of the Nile flowed through this estuary. But after the construction of several dams across the Nile, it has dwindled to two. Also the rising sea level has greatly affected this estuary. The famous ancient port city of Alexandria was drowned by such rising sea levels. It has been observed that the water level of the Mediterranean Sea may rise up to 30 cm by 2025. This rise could occupy up to 200 sq km of the Nile estuary. Water allocation problem The sharing of Nile water is a major political and cultural issue in the Eastern and Horn of Africa countries. Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya are opposed to Egypt's supremacy in sharing the Nile's water resources. According to the 1929 British-Egypt Agreement under the European colonial rule, the approval of the Egyptian government is necessary for the irrigation projects of other countries carried out in the drainage areas of the Nile River. This is a major factor in today's problems. The “Nile River Basin Initiative” is trying to solve this problem [7]. In February 1999, this organization was formed by the Ministers of Water Resources of nine countries namely Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and Congo. Eritrea is merely an observer in the system. The World Bank and some voluntary organizations played an important role in developing this system[8]. In May 2010, the five countries of this organization namely Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania came to a resolution among themselves. This resolution insists that the existing water distribution system should be reformed and the Anglo-Egyptian agreement of 1929 should be canceled [9]. Egypt and Sudan have expressed their strong opposition to this decision[10]. However, Burundi supported the resolution and signed it in February 2011[11].

"An elephant is a herbivorous (leaf-eating) mammal. It is the largest of all land animals. It is also very long-lived (~70 years). It is the longest living land animal besides humans. Elephants are very strong. The beasts of prey and the highest in the food hierarchy of wild animals, the lion (Arima), the tiger, etc., are unapproachable in strength. Lions gang up and kill a tired or young elephant that might come alone. However, such incidents are very rare. Elephants live in families. Also, they have high memory capacity. Only three elephants remain in the world today. They are African bush elephants, African forest elephants and Asian elephants. There are significant differences between them. Generally, all elephants live up to about 70 years. A male elephant is called Kaliru. A female elephant is called Bd. A baby elephant is called a calf or cub. The sound made by an elephant is called bellowing. Elephant Species African elephants are larger in stature than Asian elephants. They have large ear lobes. Both male and female African elephants have tusks. However, ivory is rarely found in Asian female elephants. The back of African elephants curves slightly inwards behind the head and is flat without raised forehead ridges. These have two petals at the apex of the thallus. But the front feet have four or five claws and the hind feet have three claws. Asian elephants have slightly raised backs. There are two ridges on the forehead and small ear lobes. There is only one petal at the apex of the thallus (upper margin). The front feet have five claws and the hind feet have four claws. Food and Habitat Elephants are herbivores or herbivores. They like to eat bamboo and sugarcane. They spend 16 hours a day gathering food. Also, their digestive capacity is very slow. Therefore, 40 percent of these foods are digested. Hence, they tend to consume a lot of food. Well-grown elephants consume about 140 to 270 kg of food per day. Physique Male elephants are typically 3 meters tall and weigh 6000 kilograms. Elephant skin is very thick. There will be a thickness of about 3 cm. However, it will be slow. Thus, mosquitoes etc. will also bite. An elephant has four strong legs. Despite its bulky body, the elephant can climb and descend hills and steep places efficiently. The proverb ""the foot of an elephant glides"" is a reference to the elephant's ability to walk in long ups and downs. Trunk The special feature of an elephant is its trunk. It is best seen only in elephants. Although a few animals have a slightly elongated frontal nose (like the proboscis monkey), there are no animals with long trunk-like limbs. The trunk is made up of a total of 40,000 muscles. It is flexible in all directions. At the tip of the trunk are the nostrils through which the elephant breathes, and tiny, highly sensitive fingertips.[1] The trunk can lift anything from a small stick to a large tree. They usually help in picking up food and drinking water. The elephant repels attacks from hostile animals with its trunk. Because the neck is short the prominence of the trunk is great. Tusk Elephants have two tusks. These are called elephant lines. This elephant coat is present only in male elephants (Kalurukku) in Asiatic Indian elephants and not in female elephants (Pitukku). But African wild elephants, both male and female, have a stripe (both male and female). The elephants living in Sumatra and Borneo, the elephants of Sri Lanka, are bisexual (Kaliru, Pd) and often have an elephant line. An elephant's tusk is an extension of an elephant's molars. Hence these are also called elephant's tusks or tusks (tusks and tusks mean teeth). Tusks can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet). And they can weigh up to 90 kilograms. These tusks are also used for trade. In March 2015, Ethiopia burned six tons of ivory taken from several elephants.[2] Leather Elephant skin is very thick. Thick skin is found in most parts of the body. The skin is about two and a half centimeters thick. However, the skin around its mouth and inside the ear is thin. Asian elephants generally have more hair on their skin than African elephants. Elephants usually smear mud or dirt all over their bodies. This is an important characteristic of elephant society. It helps to protect the skin of the elephant from the sun's heat and radiation. Although the elephant's skin is thick, it is very sensitive. This is why elephants spit mud or dirt after bathing. Legs They have strong legs to support the elephant's large body. They don't need much muscle power to stand because of their straight legs and wide feet. So they can stand for a long time without resting. African elephants often do not sit unless they are sick or injured. But Asian elephants rest often. The elephant has got a broad round foot (foot). The African elephant has three tusks (claws) on its hind legs and four on its front legs. The Asian elephant has four tusks on the hind legs and five on the front legs. Elephants can swim and climb well. These cannot be jumped. Ears Elephants have very large broad lobed ears. They play an important role in maintaining the elephant's body temperature. Elephant's ears are full of blood vessels. The ambient air cools down as the heated blood flows into the ears. Then it goes into the body and lowers the temperature. Due to blood circulation, this process is continuous and the temperature is kept under control. This is why elephants are always seen moving their ears. The upper margin of a grown elephant's ear is folded outward in the Asian elephant, and curled inward in the African elephant.[3] Cognition The elephant's brain is the largest of all land animals. It weighs a little over five kilograms. Elephants have good memory. After elephants and dolphins, elephants are considered to be the most intelligent animals. Elephants are said to be second to humans in intelligence. Elephant brains are also superior in structure and technique. They also learn to use tools. Elephants are generally compassionate.[4] Sensory Sense Elephants have excellent hearing and sense of smell. The elephant's eye is slightly myopic. Thus, an elephant relies on its keen sense of hearing and subtle sense of smell rather than its sight.[5] Their trunks are also sensitive. Not only their ears but also their trunks are capable of sensing vibrations. Their feet are capable of sensing very low frequency sound waves. Social Life The social life of greens is different from the life of pits. Embryos live with their mother's group until they reach puberty, then mostly alone. But the Bds live as a well-knit family of mother, sister and daughter. Adolescence is also observed during the breeding season. Self-awareness Elephants are self-aware. It is established by glass testing. Elephants recognize themselves when placed in front of a mirror. This ability has so far only been found in baboons, some monkeys, and dolphins. A study conducted among domesticated elephants in Zimbabwe suggests that elephants have the ability to understand a person's pointing.[6] A breeding elephant has a gestation period of 22 months. This is the longest gestation period in mammals. They usually give birth to only one calf. Twins are very rare. A newborn baby elephant weighs between 90 – 115 kilograms. Before, during, and after calving, the elephant is greatly assisted by the presence of other adult elephants. From birth, the calf is raised by the herd. Threats Poaching A major threat to elephants is poaching. Elephants are hunted for their tusks. Large, long-lived and slow-breeding elephants, over-hunting has a major impact. They are large and cannot be hidden easily. Each elephant takes years to grow and breed. Each elephant needs an average of 140 kilograms (300 pounds) of leaves per day. Due to the destruction of large animals like tigers and lions, small herbivores competing for elephants' food are multiplying and destroying plants, making it difficult for elephants to get food. Elephants are rarely killed for food by animals other than humans. Habitat Shrinkage Another important threat is the destruction of elephant habitats. Humans are destroying elephant habitats for agricultural expansion. This creates conflicts between the interests of humans and the interests of elephants. For example, elephants enter new agricultural settlements, destroying crops and endangering lives of people. An average of 150 elephants and 100 humans die in Sri Lanka every year due to such conflicts. Deforestation also reduces the habitat of elephants. Habitat loss is said to be the primary reason for the extinction of Asian elephants. Elephants require large areas of forest to survive. Because elephants enter an area in droves and destroy trees and plant vines. Then they go somewhere else. Thus the destroyed forests go to new places and re-grow and come back to the same place and get food. As habitats shrink, food runs out very quickly.[7] Humans and Elephants As elephants are killed legally and against the law by humans, there are unintended consequences for elephants' physiology. Ivory poachers in Africa hunt elephants with large tusks, leaving the remaining elephants with small tusks or no tusks. Newly born cubs are also more likely to be born with these, leading to the addition of tuskless genes in new generations, leading to the birth of large numbers of tuskless elephants. The number of such elephants has increased from 1% in 1930 to 30% in some areas. Edentulism was once a rare genetic mutation and is now becoming a common hereditary trait. Mortality Elephants can die of heart failure, heart attack, and cerebral hemorrhage.[8] Elephant in Sangam Literature In Tamil Sangam literature, the elephant is mentioned in more than 170 names.

"A seismometer (seismograph) is used to measure the movements of the earth. A seismograph is used to measure tremors caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other sources of vibration. The instrument's vibration records are used by seismologists to map the Earth's interior, and to locate and measure these different sources. The Richter scale is used to rate earthquakes. Its unit is 0 to 9 Richter scale. Earthquakes marked above 6.0 on the Richter scale are dangerous[1].

"Ethanol (Ethanol) is a chemical compound that belongs to the class of pyrethrum. It is flammable and colorless. Commonly mixed with alcoholic beverages, this passion fruit has been known as an intoxicant since ancient times. Fermenting sugars to produce ethanol using the enzyme yeast is believed to be one of the first organic chemical reactions known to mankind. Ethanol can also be produced through petrochemical processes. It is also known by many names like alcohol, ethyl alcohol, drinking alcohol. This colorless liquid compound is flammable and volatile. The chemical formula for ethyl alcohol is C2H6O. This reaction can also be written as CH3-CH2-OH or C2H5-OH. This means that one hydrogen in ethylene (C2H6) is replaced by an hydroxyl group (-OH). By writing like this, we can see that the carbon in the methyl group (CH3-) is bonded to the carbon in the methylene group (-CH2-), and its carbon is bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH). Ethanol can also be abbreviated as EtOH. Ethanol is the oldest and most common recreational drink as an addictive drug. When more than sufficient doses are consumed, intoxication increases and causes drunkenness and nervousness [1][2]. Ethanol is widely used as a solvent, fuel and as a raw material for making other chemicals. NAME REASON The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry names it ethanol in the IUPAC system. It is considered to be a compound in which the chemical group OH is attached to an alkyl group consisting of two carbon atoms bonded by a single bond [3]. The compound is called ethanol by adding the prefix 'eth' and the suffix 'al'. The prefix 'Eth' and the word Ethyl in Ethyl Alcohol are derived from the name Ethyl given to the group C2H5- in 1834 by Yasudasu Yilbeck, who coined the term 'Ethyl' from Aether, the German name for the compound C2H5-O-C2H5. In English it is commonly known as ether and more specifically as diethyl ether[4]. The Oxford English Dictionary states that ethyl is a contraction of the ancient Greek words (aithḗr, upper air), (hyle, substance). The name ethanol was created based on the decisions taken at the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature held in Geneva, Switzerland in 1892 [5]. Although the name alcohol is widely used in chemical nomenclature, the name ethanol generally remains. The Oxford English Dictionary suggests that the meaning of the word known in Arabic as the ore of the element antimony became fixed in medieval Latin[6]. The name alcohol is known to have been used for ethanol for the first time in 1753. Uses Medicinal uses Ethanol is used as an antiseptic. Ethanol is generally considered an antimicrobial against bacteria. Reduces virulence in the protein of pathogenic bacteria. It also dissolves their fat. Ethanol is active against bacteria and fungi and against many viruses. However, ethanol is ineffective against bacterial spores known as bacterial spores [7]. Ethanol is used as a detoxifier to neutralize toxins caused by methanol [8] and ethylene glycol. High concentrations of ethanol are often used to dissolve many water-insoluble drugs and their related compounds. Ethanol is useful at concentrations of 1 to 25% in cough and cold remedies, in the preparation of pain relievers, and in the preparation of mouthwashes. People suffering from respiratory disorders such as asthma should avoid alcohol consumption [9]. Ethanol is involved in over 700 drugs, including acetaminophen, iron supplements, furosemide, mannitol, phenobarbitol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and cough medicines [10]. Recreational Alcohol Ethanol acts as a psychoactive drug that induces changes in the central nervous system [11]. A body's blood alcohol concentration is usually measured by knowing the weight of ethanol in a unit volume of blood. A small amount of ethanol can cause euphoria and euphoria. Symptoms include agitation, confusion, lack of control etc. Excessive consumption of ethanol can cause harm such as loss of vision, numbness, memory loss, mental retardation, unconsciousness, and death [12]. Fuel Ethanol is used as a major stand-alone engine fuel and fuel additive. Ethanol is used as a motor fuel in Brazil. Brazil is therefore the world's leading producer of ethanol [13]. Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25 percent ethanol. Hydroxyethanol is a mixture of 95% ethanol and 5% water. This fuel is used to fuel 90% of new gasoline cars sold in Brazil. Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugarcane. It is also known to sequester and store large amounts of carbon [14]. The US and many other countries use E10 (10% ethanol) fuel and sometimes E85 (85% ethanol) fuel. Ethanol is also used as rocket fuel. Ethanol is currently used in light rocket powered racing aircraft [15]. Australian law limits the use of pure ethanol produced from sugarcane waste to 10% for vehicles. The plan emphasizes that older cars and cars designed to use slow-burning fuels should be replaced or retrofitted with mechanical valves [16]. An industry advisory group reported that the use of ethanol as a fuel reduces the harmful formation of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone pollutants [17]. Research by Argonne National Laboratory has shown that emissions of greenhouse gases emitted by various engines and fuel lines are reduced. Research results from Argonne National Laboratory show that biofuel use can reduce emissions by 8% compared to pure gasoline gasoline, A85 ethanol use by 17%, and wood pulp ethanol by 64%[18]. Ethanol combustion is a type of internal combustion engine. Products such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde released by incomplete gasoline combustion are produced in significantly larger amounts in ethanol combustion [19]. This results in increased photochemical reactions and increased ground-level ozone levels [20]. All of these are data from the Pure Fuels report on fuel emissions [21]. Ethanol production in the United States is based on corn. According to 2007 data, 7.0 billion US gallons of ethanol were produced in the United States. Another 72 projects are under construction. If these projects are completed, an additional 6.4 billion US gallons of ethanol production is guaranteed. It is also worth noting that ethanol is displacing the gasoline market in the US at the same time [22]. Sweet corn is considered as another potential source for ethanol production. Sweet corn can be cultivated in rainfed lands. The International Crops Research Institute for the Dry Tropics is conducting research to promote maize production for fuel, food, and animal feed in Asia and Africa [23] . It is said that corn production requires one-third the amount of water in the same amount of time as sugarcane cultivation. The world's first sweet corn ethanol distiller started its commercial production in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh in 2007 [24]. Ethanol's easy miscibility with water makes it impractical to transport it in modern pipelines as liquid hydrocarbons [25]. Mechanical engineers can see that mixing water with ethanol can cause malfunctions in small engines such as carburetors. Therefore studies are done to avoid mixing water with ethanol [26]. Early rockets (liquid propellant) typically used ethanol mixed with liquid oxygen as fuel. Ethanol was used as fuel in Cerumani's V2 rocket, which ushered in the space age during World War II. 25% water was added to the ethanol to cool the rocket's turret[27][28]. The engineers who designed the V2 rocket helped to use ethanol in the United States' Retsuton rockets produced after World War II[29]. The use of alcohol fuels is decreasing due to the development of modern fuels[28]. Fuel Cells Commercial fuel cells run on fuels such as renewable natural gas, hydrogen, or methanol. Ethanol is used as a substitute because of its widespread availability, high purity, low cost, and low toxicity. Several fuel cell concepts are being tried, including direct-ethanol fuel cells, thermal reforming systems, and cogeneration systems. Activities related to ethanol fuel cells are in the research stage. Various companies have begun commercializing ethanol fuel cells [30]. Ethanol as an Alternative Fuel In recent times ethanol has been proposed as an alternative fuel. It can be used directly as fuel in vehicles or mixed with other vehicle fuels such as kerosene (petrol). Although ethanol is used for fuel in many countries, it is mostly used (~90%) in the United States and Brazil. Ethanol is produced from corn in the US and sugarcane in Brazil. Ethanol production has doubled in the last five years. Note: Ethanol production in 2005 was approximately nine billion gallons. Approximately 20% of the alcohol sold in Brazil is blended with ethanol. Directly pure anhydrous ethanol is also used as vehicle fuel. Almost half of Brazil's vehicles can run on direct ethanol alone. Combustion engines can use either pure ethanol, pure gasoline, or a mixture of the two in any proportion. The US does not allow the use of full ethanol as a fuel. They only allow 85% ethanol at most. A mixture of 85% ethanol and remaining 15% gasoline is marketed as E85. The Government of India has decided to sell ethanol mixed with petrol in India.[31] Ethanol is used in households for stoves and decorative fires [32]. Feedstock Ethanol is an important feedstock for industries. Ethanol is a precursor compound for various organic compounds including ethyl alides, ethyl ethers, diethyl ether, acetic acid, and ethyl amines. The solvent ethanol is miscible with water. And ethanol also acts as a good general solvent. Ethanol is used in dyes, tinctures, markers, personal care products, etc. Ethanol is used to precipitate compounds in the presence of alcohol and to purify DNA and RNA. Because of its low melting point (−114.14 °C) and low toxicity, ethanol is sometimes used in laboratories with dry ice or in coolers to reduce heat. Negative Effects Imbalance When alcohol enters the brain, it delays the signals sent from nerve cells. This affects functions such as control, thinking and movement [33]. Intestinal Diseases Alcohol stimulates the production of gastric juice even when there is no food in the stomach. As a result, acid secretion is stimulated to digest protein molecules in general. High acid secretion erodes the inner walls of the stomach. The inner wall of the stomach is normally protected by a layer of mucosa. This prevents the stomach from undergoing digestion itself. People suffering from peptic ulcer have damaged this membrane. Peptic ulcers are usually associated with the bacteria H. pylori. A type of mucus secreted by these bacteria weakens the lining of the stomach. So people suffering from peptic ulcer disease should avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach. Such consumption can cause excessive acid secretion and further destroy the weakened intestinal wall [34]. This causes severe pain in the abdomen and abdominal swelling. Dark black stools are indicative of internal bleeding [35]. People with such problems should be freed from continuous alcohol consumption [35]. Systemic pro-inflammatory changes induced by alcohol consumption occur through two intestinal pathways. (1)Increasing release of lipoproteins by altering intestinal tissue fractions; (2) Weakening of the intestinal mucosa thereby allowing lipoic acid to enter the circulatory system. Due to the increased release of this compound, the liver is affected. This results in organ damage [36]. Short-term toxic inflammations In patients with a history of asthma, drinking ethanol-containing beverages can cause allergic reactions such as skin rashes, increased rhinitis, and bronchial congestion. Symptoms of such effects begin to appear within an hour of consuming alcohol [9]. Long-term Effects Alcohol consumption has major effects such as birth defects [37], increased risk of cancer [38], and increased blood triglyceride levels [39]. Addictive effects of acetaldehyde are produced by oxidizing enzymes such as catalase and cytochrome P-4502E1 in the brain in reinforcement disorders [40]. Although aldehydes are thought to have negative effects, they play an important role in deactivating the central nervous system [41]. The intoxicating or addictive properties of ethanol are mediated by dopamine neurons in the inhibitory pathway known as the mesolimbic reward pathway. The pathway that connects the basal lamina of the midbrain with the nucleus accumbens at the base of the forebrain is called the striatum.[42][43] One of the primary effects of ethanol is to act as a transstimulatory inhibitor at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors [44]. Ethanol at high doses inhibits both high-gated ion channels and voltage-gated ion channels in neurons. Dopamine is released at afferent synapses in acute ethanol ingestion[42][43]. In chronic acute ethanol addicts, similar induction of transcription factors results in cellular phosphorylation and conversion to chronic alcohol addiction [43][45][46][47]. Abruptly stopping years of heavy drinking can also be life-threatening. Anxiety can cause autonomic dysfunction, seizures and paranoia. Reactions Ethanol interacts with depressant drugs such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and opioids [48] Ethanol also interacts with the production of cocethylene, another psychoactive substance [49] Ethanol increases the concentration of the CNS drug methylphenidate [50]. Ethanol, when used in combination with cannabis, attracts tetrahydrocannabinol and increases its levels in the body [51]. Alcohol and Metronidazole Antibiotics Drug interactions between metronidazole and alcohol are particularly noteworthy. Metronidazole, an antibacterial agent, destroys cellular DNA and its functions by killing bacteria [52]. Metronidazole is commonly used to treat diarrhea caused by Clostridium tipicile bacteria. Clostridium tipicile is one of the bacteria that causes diarrhea. This can cause inflammation of the colon and even death. Patients taking metronidazole should strictly avoid the use of alcohol. Alcohol and metronidazole together cause side effects such as flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and sweating [53][54][54]. These symptoms are often attributed to disulfiram-like reactions. Metronidazole binds to an enzyme that normally metabolizes alcohol. The ability of the liver to excrete alcohol is affected by such enzyme binding [55]. Pharmacodynamics The primary function of ethanol is to bind to gamma aminobutyric acid receptors and enhance their effects[56]. Also, ethanol has the following mechanisms of action:[57]. • Gamma aminobutyric acid A receptor inverse modulator[44] (primarily of δ subunit-containing receptors) •N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism modulator[44][58] •Dopamine release in the intermediate pathway[41][44] • Nucleus accumbens release from opioid receptors in the brain •α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonism modulator [58] •Kainate receptor antagonism modulator [58] •Nicotine is an acetocholine receptor agonist • 5-HD3 receptor activator • Glycine reuptake inhibitor [59] • Adenosine reuptake inhibitor [60] • L-type calcium channel blocker •K-protein potassium shunt Pharmacokinetics Alcohol is oxidized in the liver by dehydrogenase and the elimination of ethanol from the human body is reduced. Therefore, the removal of dark alcohol from the blood is considered a cyclic chemical reaction. This means that alcohol leaves the body at a constant rate. A chemical step ratio for one substance may be typical for another substance. Thus blood alcohol levels are used to alter the metabolic rate of methanol and ethylene glycol metabolism. Its metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid are more toxic than methanol. Ethanol is therefore injected to reduce the production and concentration of such toxins [61]. Ethylene glycol is detoxified in a similar manner. Pure ethanol causes eye and skin irritation [62]. Liver damage may occur with chronic continuous use [63]. The European Union reports an occupational exposure limit of one part per thousand for the concentration of ethanol in the atmosphere [63]. Metabolism Ethanol in the human body is converted to the alcohol D-itrosanasol acetaldehyde and then to the aldehyde d-itrosanasol acetyl. Acetyl coenzyme A is a byproduct of the metabolism of both carbohydrates and fats. This acetal can be used for biosynthesis and energy. Similarly ethanol releases approximately 7 kcal of energy per gram [64]. However, the acetaldehyde [65] formed in the first step is more toxic than ethanol. It causes liver cirrhosis [66] and carcinogenesis. Nicotinamide is catalyzed to adenine dinucleotide during alcohol metabolism via the related D-hydrocanase. Alcohol is also closely related to digestion. Ethyl alcohol is a partial solvent. Ethanol, which is hydrophobic or fatty, diffuses across the stomach wall. In fact, alcohol is one of the rarest of substances absorbed into the stomach. Most food is absorbed by the small intestine. Alcohol delays the release of gastric contents after absorption by the small intestine [67]. After absorption it reaches the liver where it is metabolized. Unprocessed alcohol passes through the liver to the heart. The liver can only process a certain amount of alcohol per unit time, so when one drinks too much alcohol it reaches the heart. In the heart, it slows down the rate of heart contractions. As a result, the heart pumps less blood. Hence overall body blood pressure also decreases [33]. Blood entering the heart is likely to enter the lungs. Traces of alcohol are visible on the breath. A breathalyzer detects drunk drivers. Blood returning from the lungs to the heart is pumped throughout the body. Alcohol increases the concentration of lipoproteins in the blood. These carry fat. The chances of having a heart attack are reduced. A physiological benefit of alcohol is that moderate alcohol consumption can reduce myocardial infarction [68]. Some individuals who consume more ethanol than others are more tolerant of severe symptoms. In some such individuals, ethanol is metabolized very rapidly without affecting the enzymes. CHEMICAL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES Ethanol is a colorless liquid that is slightly volatile and volatile. It burns with a smokeless blue color and is rarely seen in ordinary light. Its physical properties are determined based on the hydroxyl group and short chain structure. A hydroxyl group can participate in hydrogen bonding. This makes it more viscous and less volatile than propane, a terminal organic compound of similar molecular weight. It is slightly more reflective than water. The refractive index of ethanol is 1.36242. (when λ=589.3 nm at 18.35°C) At a pressure of 4.3 × 10−4 pascal, the triple point of ethanol is 150 Kelvin. Solvent Properties Ethanol is a versatile solvent, miscible with water and miscible with many organic solvents including acetic acid, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, glycerol, nitromethane, pyridine, and toluene [69][69][69][69][69][69][69][69] 70]. Ethanol is miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane and hexane, and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene [70]. The miscibility of ethanol with water differs from the miscibility of longer chain compounds. The miscibility with water of compounds longer than five carbons decreases with increasing carbon number [71] The miscibility of alkanes from alkane to undecane is restricted. Mixtures of dodecadecane and higher alkanes exhibit a miscibility gap in their miscibility with temperature [72]). And temperature also shows a larger mixing gap for higher alkanes. The density of an ethanol-water mixture is less than the sum of its individual components. Addition of equal amounts of ethanol and water yields only an ethanol–water mixture with a volume of 1.92[69][73]. It is exothermic and emits 777U/mol of heat at 298 K[74]. An ethanol-water mixture consisting of 89 mol% ethanol and 11 mol% water forms a non-boiling mixture [75]. It can also be referred to as 95.6 percent ethanol by mass mixture. At normal pressure the mixture boils at 78°C. Also, the constituents of this volatile mixture are temperature-pressure dependent. These disappear below 303 Kelvin [76]. Hydrogen bonding converts pure ethanol to ethanol by absorbing water. Ethanol also absorbs water from the air. Ethanol also dissolves many ionic compounds due to the polarity of the hydroxyl group. Some compounds that dissolve in ethanol are sodium and potassium hydroxides, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and sodium bromide [70]. Sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol [70]. Because of the non-terminal end of the ethanol molecule, it dissolves non-polar oils [77], flavorings, and colorants. Flammability A 40% by weight ethanol - water solution ignites on an ignition source when heated above 26°C. This temperature is called ignition temperature [78]. The ignition temperature of pure ethanol is 16.60°C. It is slightly lower than the average room temperature. Weight and ignition temperature of ethanol[79] ! Weight %!! temperature |- | 10% || 49°C (120°F) |- | 20% || 36°C (97°F) |- | 30% || 29°C (84°F) |- | 40% || 26°C (79°F) |- | 50% || 24°C (75°F) |- | 60% || 22°C (72°F) |- | 70% || 21°C (70°F) |- | 80% || 20°C (68°F) |- | 90% || 17°C (63°F) |- | 96% || 17°C (63°F) |}: Natural origin Ethanol appears as a by-product of metabolic activities by yeast. Ethanol is found in ripe fruits [80]. Ethanol is found in the intoxicating drink called gallu, made from the sap of palm and coconut trees, and in some animals such as woodpeckers [81]. Many plants that naturally grow in anaerobic environments produce ethanol [82]. Ethanol ice is also found in interstellar clouds in space[83]. Also in a petrochemical production process that hydrolyzes the product ethylene. Ethanol is also produced by the biological process of fermentation with cane sugar [84]. A particular type of production method can be said to be best based on the cost of feedstock. In the 1970s a petrochemical production system was considered the best in the United States, and in the 1980s a corn-based biological process was considered the best [85]. Ethanol, also known as industrial feedstock ethanol or ethanol solvent or synthetic ethanol, is produced by hydrolyzing the petrochemical feedstock ethylene in the presence of an acid catalyst. C2H4 + H2O → CH3CH2OH Phosphoric acid is commonly used as a catalyst in this type of reaction [86] In 1947 Cell Oil Company produced ethanol by this method [87]. The reaction is carried out at high pressure at 300°C in a steam to ethylene ratio of 1.0:0.6[88][89]. Union Carbide Company[90] and other companies in the United States used this method. At present, LyondellBasell is the only company producing ethanol using this method. Nowadays ethylene is reacted with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce ethyl sulfate. It is then indirectly hydrolyzed by hydrolysis to produce ethanol. Sulfuric acid is regenerated[91]. C2H4 + H2SO4 → CH3CH2SO4H CH3CH2SO4H + H2O CH3CH2OH + H2SO4 Ethanol found in alcoholic beverages is produced by fermentation. Some yeasts ferment with sugar to yield ethanol. Formed with carbon monoxide. C6H12O6 → 2 CH3CH2OH + 2 CO2 C12H22O11 + H2O → 4 CH3CH2OH + 4 CO2 At suitable temperature the yeasts undergo fermentation reaction to give alcohol. This reaction usually occurs at a temperature of 35–40 °C. The sugar required for fermentation is also derived from cellulose. Various agricultural products have been identified as sugar sources for fermentation by cellulosic technology [92]. Test There are two types of methods followed in factories to determine the density of ethanol. 1. Infrared ethanol sensor method. 2. Hydrometer Ethanol produced by various methods of distillation is found as a mixture with water. Hence it becomes imperative to purify ethanol. A mixture of ethanol and water at atmospheric pressure can be purified by fractional distillation. The water in ethanol is completely removed with the help of chemicals like benzene, cyclic hexane and heptane. Apart from these many other methods are used for purification. Salting method with addition of potassium carbonate. Direct Electrochemical Condensation of Carbon Monoxide m Lubricant extraction method Membrane graft evaporation method Distillation method Pressure vortex propagation method [93] Ethanol grades are pure ethanol and alcohols are taxed as psychoactive drugs. But ethanol has many uses beyond consumption. If the tax burden is reduced to account for these uses, the tendency for ethanol to be made into non-drinkable products will be reduced. Alcohol produced by adding bittering agents such as the bittering chemical thenatonium benzoate, methanol, naphtha, and pyridine is called denatured alcohol [94][95]. Pure alcohol or anhydrous alcohol refers to alcohol with a minimal fraction of water. The quality is given differently according to the quantity of water. Substances such as benzene added to remove water are mixed with these alcohols in trace amounts [96]. This morning is unusable for human consumption. But it is used as a solvent and fuel in industries. Ethanol is used as a solvent in UV–vis spectrometry [97]. Pure ethanol is graded at 200 ppm in the US and 175 ppm in the UK [98]. A mixture of 96% ethanol and 4% water is called distilled cyprid. It is used in many fields as a substitute for anhydrous alcohol [99]. Reactions Ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol. This means that at least two hydrogen atoms are attached to the carbon containing the hydroxyl group. Many ethanol reactions occur at the hydroxyl group. Ether formation reaction Ethanol reacts with carboxylic acids in the presence of acid catalysts to give ethyl esters and water. RCOOH + HOCH2CH3 → RCOOCH2CH3 + H2O Large amounts of professionally produced eggs are prepared and dehydrated in this manner. Acids are converted back into alcohols and salts in the presence of acid or alkali. This is called saponification reaction. Ethanol reacts with mineral acids to form compounds. Sulfur mooxide is added to ethanol to produce diethyl sulfate and phosphorus pentoxide to produce moethyl phosphate. Diethyl sulfate is used as an ethylating agent in organic synthesis reactions. Ethyl nitrile, prepared by adding sodium nitrile and sulfuric acid to ethanol, is useful as a diuretic. Ethanol loses a little water in strong dehydrating solvents to give diethyl ether and other co-products. Above 160°C complete dehydration occurs and ethylene is formed. 2 CH3CH2OH → CH3CH2OCH2CH3 + H2O (120 °C) CH3CH2OH → H2C=CH2 + H2O (above 160 °C) Combustion Reaction When ethanol undergoes complete combustion, carbon monoxide and water are formed. C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l); −ΔHc = 1371 kJ/mol[100] = 29.8 kJ/g = 327 kcal/mole = 7.1 kcal/g C2H5OH (Ni) + 3 O2 (gas) → 2 CO2 (gas) + 3 H2O (vapor); −ΔHc = 1236 kJ/mol = 26.8 cu/g = 295.4 kcal/mol = 6.41 kcal/g[101] Specific heat = 2.44 kJ/(kg•Kelvin) Acidic Chemistry Ethanol is a neutral molecule. The pH index of this solution is 7. It can react with an alkali metal such as sodium to form an ethoxide (CH3CH2O−) ion, making it coalkaline.[71] 2 CH3CH2OH + 2 Na → 2 CH3CH2ONa + H2. Or react with the strong base sodium hydride. CH3CH2OH + NaH → CH3CH2ONa + H2 The acidity of water and ethanol is almost equal. Their pKa values ​​are 15.7 and 16 respectively. So sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide are closely united in equilibrium. CH3CH2OH + NaOH CH3CH2ONa + H2O Ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor compound for the production of chlorinated ethyl amides. But the reactions can be explained. Ethanol reacts SN2 with hydrogen chloride to form ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide. CH3CH2OH + HCl → CH3CH2Cl + H2O Catalysts such as zinc chloride are essential for these reactions [91]. A sulfuric acid catalyst is required for HBr synthesis [91]. Ethyl alides can also be prepared with ethanol using halogenating agents such as phosphorus bibromide or thionyl chloride [71][91]. CH3CH2OH + SOCl2 → CH3CH2Cl + SO2 + HCl. Ethanol on heating in the presence of alkali along with halogens gives the corresponding alloforms (CHX3, where X = Cl, Br, I). This is known as the alloform reaction [102] when it reacts with chlorine to form chlorine as an intermediate chemical. With water it forms chloral anhydride:[103] 4 Cl2 + CH3CH2OH → CCl3CHO + 5 HCl CCl3CHO + H2O → CCl3C(OH)2H. Oxidation Ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid depending on the reagent and conditions used[91]. Ethanol oxidation, which is not so important in industries, becomes important in the human body. History Ethanol production by fermentation has been practiced by humans since ancient times. Ethanol consumption and addiction have been known since ancient times. Ethanol alcohol has been used as an intoxicant since prehistoric man. Evidence for this is found in the dried remains of 9,000-year-old pottery found in China[104]. The early Greeks and Arabs knew about distillation. Alcohol is known to have been produced in the 12th century in late medieval medicine[105]. A report on isolated alcohols was reported by Raymond Lull [105]. In 1796 a Cheruman-Russian chemist prepared pure ethanol by distillation at low temperature by adding anhydrous alkali to partially purified ethanol [106]. The French chemist Antoine Lavasy described ethanol as a compound of the elements carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. In 1807 Nicholas Theodor confirmed the molecular probability of ethanol[107][108]. Fifty years later the structure of ethanol was confirmed [109]. Ethanol was produced synthetically in 1825 by Michel Barade. He reported that coal gas is strongly attracted to sulfuric acid.[110] He gave the resulting solution to Ennell, a British chemist who discovered ethyl hydrogen sulfate.[111] The discovery of the decomposition of ethyl hydrogen sulfate in 1828[112][113] confirmed the production of ethanol from ethylene. Ethanol was used for lighting in the 1840s[114]. It has been used as an automobile fuel since 1908[115]. Ethanol produced from ethylene has been used industrially[116]. Ethanol has been widely used for human applications, including consumption, flavoring, flavoring, coloring, and medicine. . In chemistry it is a solvent and a raw material for making other chemicals. Ethanol has a long history as a heat, light, and fuel. A study of traffic accidents in socioculture found that 41% of the population attributed them to alcohol [117]. It has also been confirmed that the driver's alcoholism is responsible for the increasing number of car accidents[118]. Various laws have been enacted in the United States regarding blood alcohol levels.[119] Citations External links at The Periodic Table of Videos (University of Nottingham) ethanol safety information chemical data on ethanol news and market data on ethanol futures Calculation of , , , of ethanol A look into the history of ethanol Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signal transduction pathway: Category:Primary alcohols Category:Fuels Category:Alcohol Solvents Category:Household Chemicals Category:Alkanols Category: Anesthetics Category:Disinfectants Category:Human metabolites ",What is the molecular formula of ethanol?,C2H5-OH,765
"A number is a mathematical object used for counting, measuring and classifying. There are many types of numbers in mathematics. The primes for numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) are the basic examples of numbers.[1] The notation used to denote numbers is called numeral.[2] It can be assumed that the concept of 'number' was created when man learned to count his fingers at the time of his birth. The development of the concept of numbers is the origin of mathematics. In mathematics, over the centuries, negative[3] numbers,[4] rational numbers ({{math|1/2, −2/3), real numbers,[5] (√2]], π), problem numbers [6] [4] The set of numbers is extended. In Arithmetic, numbers are predicted through the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Number theory explains the properties of numbers. The concept of number has been important to Tamils ​​since ancient times. Thiruvalluvar's saying, ""Ennenpa enai eklaenpa; these two are eyes for the living being"" and Olavaiyar's saying ""Ennenpa ikazhel"" explain the importance attached to numbers and letters in Palanthamizhar thought. Classification Numbers are classified into number sets or moments such as natural number, prime number.[7] Major Classifications of Numbers: Natural numbers are the most familiar numbers in practice, the natural numbers used for counting. These are also called natural numbers or natural numbers. These are 1, 2, ... This volume (moment) is N {\displaystyle \mathbf {N} } is denoted in mathematics by the special letter Integers Adding positive and negative numbers (-1, -2, -3, ...) to natural numbers form the moment of integers. is the symbol of the moment. There are three types of integers: prime or even numbers: 1, 2, 3, ... Witchcraft or witchcraft: 0 Negative numbers or negative numbers: -1, -2, -3, ... The moment of these whole numbers is N, the moment of natural numbers {\displaystyle \mathbf {N} } Includes That is, rational numbers are called fractional numbers or rational numbers that are represented by whole numbers up and down a fraction represented by ratios made up of whole numbers such as half, quarter, and one-third. These can be lowercase numbers such as half-quarters, half-cents, or fractions (fractions, fractions), or even numbers that represent an extreme number such as 7/3, 21/6. These category numbers are denoted by the letter Kanam. This proportional moment includes the moment of integers. That means Z ⊂ Q {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} \subset \mathbf {Q} } . √ means that all real numbers are not rational numbers 2 {\displaystyle \surd {2}} Mathematicians knew the example of numbers etc. from Greek mathematics and from Hindu Sutras. But the rational number R is a large number including the moment {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} } It was not until the 19th century that man knew without a doubt that there was a number and that it contained all the numbers we encounter in life. R {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} } The elements of a number are called prime numbers and intrinsic numbers because they exist. In this, if the rational numbers are removed, the other numbers are called non-rational numbers. Irrational numbers are of two types: algebraic numbers and prime numbers. Complex numbers All the numbers above are the creations of mathematicians. For example, complex numbers (a class of numbers called polynomials or complex numbers) play an important role in mathematics and all its applications. The moment of complex numbers is C {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} } denoted by the symbol Every complex has an intrinsic part (real part) and a structural part (imaginary part). C {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} } Every number z in is of the form a + ib. where a and b are real numbers. Let a be the internal or real part of z and b the structural or imaginary part of z. where i is an imaginary unit. The relationship between these oil types is as shown below: N ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R ⊂ C {\displaystyle \mathbf {N} \subset \mathbf {Z} \subset \mathbf {Q} \subset \mathbf {R} \subset \mathbf {C} } Prime Numbers A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and the same number. 1 and other natural numbers with denominators other than the same number (except 1) are called composite numbers. For example, the natural number 11 is a prime number. It has no divisors other than 1. Nature number 6 is a mixed girl. Because its denominators are: 1, 2, 3, 6. Not only in mathematics, but in many branches of science, the concept of prime number contributes to many relationships about numbers. Prime numbers play an important role in number theory. Even though the concept of prime numbers has not existed since the beginning of numbers, in theory it must have originated in the mind of man and thus the beginning of science. After centuries of not being able to study some ideas about prime numbers, nowadays, with the help of computers, they are being studied again with great success. Digits Digits or numerals are different from numbers. Digits are symbols that represent numbers. There are many types of number systems in circulation. The Egyptians were the first to discover cryptographic numerals, followed by the Greeks who associated numbers with the Ionian and Doric alphabet.[8] Roman numerals, an addition to the alphabet, were in major use in Europe until the Middle Ages, when Arabic numerals were introduced in the later 14th century. Arabic numerals are still the most widely used numerals in the world today.[9] Arabic numerals were made more useful by Puchium, discovered by ancient Indian mathematicians around 500 AD.[9] Kabregar numbers Kabregar numbers are significant in mathematics invented by the Indian mathematician Kabregar. For example, 703 is referred to as a cabaret number. The characteristics of this number are that the square of this number, i.e. the product of multiplying this number by the same number, is classified into two parts, and the product of the two parts is the root number, i.e. 703. 703 X 703 = 494209 Product 494209 and two parts of 494 and 209 The product of these two parts is: 494 + 209 = 703 History Animal bones were the first used by humans for numbering.[10] The Mesopotamians were the first people in history to use numbers as value. They are K. By 3400 BC they were using the hexadecimal number system. Egyptians By 3100 BC they were using the decimal number system.[11] The Babylonians and Egyptians used the term shurya (0) and the Indians used shurya as the term zero.[12] Negative Numbers Abstract sets of negative numbers were realized in China in the period from 100 BC to 50 BC. Various methods of representing numbers have been dealt with in the book of Mathematical Art, which covers the nine properties. Red dashes were used to indicate even numbers. Dark circles were used to indicate opposite numbers.[13] The first mentions of these oils in Western use date back to AD. They were found in Greece in the third century. In Diophantus' Arithmetica, the inverse number was mentioned as a solution to an equation 4x + 20 = 0. Also, this equation gave an absurd solution. AD Over 600 periods of time, negative numbers were used in debt settlement in India. AD The ""Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta"" by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in 628 discussed the earlier references to Tyhopandhas more openly. The Quadratic formula, which was developed by Brahmagupta using opposite numbers, usually consisting of four parts, is still in use today. However, in India in the twelfth century Basukara gave opposite sources for quadratic equations. He also said that the negative value will not be accepted. Due to inadequacy of counter sources, people do not accept them. Until the seventeenth century, most European mathematicians resisted the idea of ​​negative numbers. However, Fibonacci allowed opposite solutions to financial problems. There, they were first taken as loans (Liber Abaci, Chapter 13 of 1202). Thereafter, they were considered as substitutes for Nuts. At the same time, the Chinese drew a diagonal line through the straight line of even numbers and indicated the opposites of those even numbers.[14] In the fifteenth century, Nicolas Chuquet was the first to introduce the use of negative numbers in European mathematical operations. He used those numbers as exponents. However, he referred to them as Absurd numbers. Prime numbers The existence of prime numbers was first established by Liouville in 1844 and 1851. In 1873, Hermite proved that e was a prime number. In 1882 Lindemann proved that is a prime number. Finally, Cantor described the set of prime numbers as uncountably infinite. But he referred to the set of algebraic numbers as countably infinite. Therefore, odd numbers are infinite. Infinity The mathematical concept of infinity is mentioned in the Esurveda, an ancient Indian scripture. One of the points it makes is that if a part is removed from infinity, or if one is added to infinity, infinity remains unchanged. BC 400 Among the Jain mathematicians, infinity was a prominent subject of their philosophical education. They classified infinity into five categories. They are: Unidirectional infinity Bidirectional infinity Area infinity Annual infinity Vertical infinity See also Tamil numbers Number system List of numbers Mathematical constants Odd and even numbers Prime numbers Small numbers Big numbers Order based on quantity (numbers).

"The real (; Brazilian Portuguese: reão; plural reais) is the currency of Brazil. Its symbol is R$ and ISO code is BRL. A real is divided into 100 centavos (""hundredths""). The real, which is now in circulation, was introduced in 1994 as a replacement for the old currency. The new currency was issued as part of a fiscal management reform implemented to control three decades of rising inflation. The new currency, issued at an exchange rate equal to the US dollar (1:1), depreciated to 2:1 in 1999 and almost 4:1 in 2002. Then it reached 2:1 again in 2006 due to economic growth. The exchange rate at December 31, 2013 was 2.36 Brazilian Reals per US Dollar. Similar to the dollar, it is denoted by a double dashed cipher symbol ().[3] However, Unkurri treats this as a difference in typeface and does not provide a separate code.[4] Evidence above Category:Brazil Category:Coins ",What is the currency of Brazil?,Real,0

"The human brain is the head of the human nervous system and the most complex of human organs. The human brain controls unconscious, involuntary activities such as breathing, digestion, heartbeat, and yawning[1],[2] and complex higher-order activities that occur consciously, such as thinking, understanding, and reasoning. The human brain is capable of handling such complex high-level operations better than any other living organism. Although the human brain resembles the general shape of other mammalian brains in many ways, it is at least five times larger in body weight-to-brain volume ratio than their brains. This is due to the well-developed cerebral cortex of the human brain. Formed by neural tissue and consisting of several series of folds, this region is located in the human forebrain. In particular, the frontal lobes of the brain, which are responsible for the specialized functions that distinguish humans from other animals, such as self-control, planning, reasoning, and learning, are well developed in the human brain. Also, the area responsible for eye sight is also well developed in the human brain. In the evolution of the brain, the ratio of brain-body size has gradually increased from the earliest small mammal, the primate, through the great ape to one of the higher animals, man; This is called encephalisation. Of the approximately 50–100 billion (5000–10000 million) neurons (1011) in the human brain, approximately 10 billion neurons (1010) are cortical pyramidal cells. These cells use approximately 100 trillion (1014) synapses to send signals (signals) between them. The human brain is protected by the thick bones of the skull, the cerebrospinal fluid, from vibrations and external damage, and from the blood and blood-borne diseases through the blood-brain barrier system. However, due to its delicate nature, it is inevitable that it will be harmed by various diseases and damages. Common types of brain damage include closed head injuries, head injuries, strokes caused by blood clots in the brain, and exposure to chemical toxins called neurotoxins. Suffering from brain infections is extremely rare. Because the blood-brain barrier in the human brain filters out most of the bacterial germs that can enter the bloodstream and attack the body's organs, the brain is largely protected from infectious microbes. However, when the brain is rarely attacked by bacteria, treatment with antibodies becomes more difficult. This is because the same blood-brain barrier system also blocks the immune system. Viruses can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. These jump together with the white blood cells in the blood. Apart from these, many common genetic diseases can also affect the brain. Among them, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, in which the body's immune system attacks the nervous system, are important. Psychological diseases such as depression, low mood and cognitive impairment are also caused by changes in the brain. An average male brain weighs about 1.5 kilograms,[3] and has a volume of 1260 cubic centimeters. The female brain is approximately 1130 cubic centimeters (cc).[4] When a person is alive, the outer surface of the brain is dark gray and the inner mass is yellow and white. The photograph on the right shows a horizontal cross-section through the middle of the brain. In this image, the cerebral cortex (the convoluted area) and the white matter can be seen. Millions of myelinated fibers connect the white matter and the cerebral cortex. The total length of the myelin fibers in the brain of a 20-year-old male is about 176,000 kilometers. The total length of myelin fibers in the female brain at the same age is about 149,000 kilometers.[5] At the top of the brain, the convoluted cerebral cortex is divided into two hemispheres, known as the cerebral hemispheres. This region is the largest part of the brain.[6] The part of the stem that lies below the cerebral hemispheres and joins them is called the brainstem. At the back of the brain, below the cerebral cortex, the area behind the brainstem is known as the cerebellum. This region is distinguished from other parts of the brain by its horizontal groove-like structure. The cerebellum, also found in other mammalian species, is one of the smallest parts of the brain. Also, as a general rule, the smaller an organism's cerebellum, the less convoluted its cerebral cortex is. An example of this is that the cerebral cortex of rat and hamster is smooth without folds. Whales and dolphins, the largest mammals, have more folds in the cerebral cortex than humans. A distinctive feature of the human brain is the enormous cerebral cortex. Being so large in humans, it appears to completely cover the rest of the brain. The human cerebellum is larger than that of other mammals. Human cerebral cortex plays a major role not only in size but also in brain function. For example, a mouse can walk, eat, and sense external changes even after its cerebral cortex has been surgically removed. But a person whose cerebral cortex is damaged will go into a permanent coma. The cerebral cortex is divided into roughly equal right-left hemispheres. Anatomists divide each hemisphere into four lobes. They are frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe. It is noteworthy that the names of these sections are arranged according to the names of the cranial bones adjacent to the sections. The cerebral cortex is shaped like a broad sheet of neural tissue folded into several folds and compressed into a narrow skull. The area of ​​the neuron in each cerebral hemisphere when unfolded is about 1.3 square feet.[7] Anatomists refer to the groove formed by these folds as a sulcus, and the smooth area between each groove as a gyrus. Although the folds of all humans generally have approximately the same shape, the differences are markedly distinct with some variation in shape and location of values. However, some large folds can be found in all mandarins. Different regions of the cerebral cortex have the ability to learn and govern different cognitive abilities (eg, seeing, hearing, feeling). This can be confirmed in various ways: damage to a specific part of the brain, affecting only a specific sense, special design of the magnetic resonance imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a specific sense and the brain that governs it. Identifying the specific region and examining the fibrous structure of the cerebral cortex is significant. According to anatomists, the cerebral cortex can be divided into about 6 layers with the aid of a microscope. However, it is not possible to separate these layers in all parts of the brain. Many anatomists have diagrammed these layers in the cortex. Brodmann, who is known as the first among them, classified the different parts of the brain into 52 sections. (Later anatomists divided it into many more subdivisions). Topographic Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is a motor cortex located in the anterior margin of the central sulcus as shown in Fig. The motor cortex is the part of the body that sends commands to the voluntary muscles of the body. The diagram on the right shows that the primary motor cortex, one of the motor cortexes of the brain, organizes the movement control areas of the body parts sequentially. In other words, in the order in which the parts of the body are located, first the feet, followed by the legs, thighs, and abdomen, in the same order, their control areas are set up in the brain. Doctors have also found that when an area of ​​the cortex is electrically stimulated, the muscles of the organ that the area controls tighten. However, each organ is controlled by varying degrees of cortical neuron. For example, the cortical afferents that control organs in the human head are three times larger than the cortical afferents that control the spine. The more dense (larger) the cortical nerve fibers that control an organ, the greater the motor control and sensory perception of that organ. Because of this, the human lips, tongue, fingers, and facial muscles are small but perform many fine functions (eg, tongue, lips - speaking) and the amount of cortical nerve fibers representing them is large. Visual cortex The cortical neural structures for human vision are similar to those of the retina at the back of the eye. Each retinal nerve cell, which transforms the light reaching the human eye into vision, is represented by certain cortical neurons in this area. In particular, neurons in the center of the retina (with greater emphasis on objects in the center of vision) are allocated more visual cortical neurons than neurons at the periphery of the retina. The visual cortex in the cerebral cortex contains hundreds of different retinotopic maps to examine the appearance of a scene falling on the retina from different angles. Through these, an appearance is examined from multiple angles simultaneously and a final decision is made. The primary visual cortex (section 17 of Brodmann's classification) receives nerve impulses from the eye directly via the thalamus. This region is able to easily extract the main characteristics (visual features) from the received images. The forebrain represents the two large chambers of the spherical, gray matter in the forebrain. These transmit impulses from the senses to the cerebral cortex. The visual cortex detects the color, motion, speed, and shape of objects in the scene after the primary visual cortex. Auditory cortex The auditory sensory region consists of tonotopic maps organized in a spatial tonality pattern. The left-brain tone system means that each different tone (sound frequency) heard by humans excites a different area of ​​the auditory cortex. In short, it means spatially tuning the frequency of the tone. The total combination of excitations occurring in different parts of the auditory cortex produces a word. Sounds are distinguished by the frequency they produce (ie, high pitch or low pitch). Like the visual system, the auditory region has more than one tonotopic cortical map. Each draft requires a different approach to sound. Verbal mapping Verbal mapping involves identifying each control area of ​​the brain and the functions of the organ it controls and mapping them to each other. Each hemisphere of the brain controls a part of the body. Also, it is noteworthy that the right brain controls the left side of the body and the left brain controls the right side of the body. In the same way, the motor connections and sensory connections between the brain and the spinal cord, in the middle of the brainstem, shift from right to left and from left to right.

"The Amazon River (Sri Lankan case: Amazon River, commonly abbreviated Amazon (US: /ˈæməzɒn/ or UK: /ˈæməzən/; Spanish and Portuguese: Amazonas)) is a river in the South American continent. It is one of the two longest rivers in the world, the other being the Nile River. .The Amazon is the largest river in the world, and according to some authors, it is the largest river in the world with a length of 6400 km .Its total volume is greater than the volume of fresh water of the next eight major rivers. The course of this river has changed many times. Originally flowing towards the west, this river flows towards the east due to the growth of the Andes Mountains. The Amazon River is not crossed by a bridge anywhere. This is not because of its width, but because modern engineers can build a bridge across it. However, as most of the river flows through tropical rainforests and there are few cities there is no need for a bridge. Although the Amazon River is the largest in the world by various measures, it is only slightly shorter than the Nile in terms of length, according to most geographers. However, some scientists from Brazil and Peru refuse to accept this. The river discharges approximately 209,000 cubic meters per second—approximately 6,591 cubic kilometers per year, more than the next seven largest rivers combined—and the Amazon accounts for 20% of the world's river discharge.[1] The Amazon basin is the world's largest drainage basin, covering an area of ​​approximately 7,050,000 square kilometers (2,720,000 sq mi). Countries where the Amazon flows Although its tributaries originate in Peru and Ecuador, most of its riverbed is located in Brazil. Amazon has more than six thousand affiliates. Out of these 17 rivers have a length of more than 1000 km. Watershed The Amazon drainage basin is the largest in the world. It accounts for approximately 40 percent of the area of ​​South America. A catchment area of ​​this is found in the inner Andean highlands. The area is close to the Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River drains a lot of water into the Atlantic Ocean. During the rainy season the flow was up to 300,000 cubic meters per second and during the period 1973-1990 it was approximately 209,000 cubic meters. The Amazon basin is connected to the basin of the Orinoco, another major river in South America, by the Caziquier Canal. So it is called a natural water connection. Although the term canal refers to the Casiquiuer, it is a tributary of the upper Orino River. It runs south to join the Rio Negro, a tributary of the Amazon. ORIGIN The Amazon River is a large multi-tributary river system in Peru and Ecuador. Many flow directly into rivers such as the Maranon and Ugayali. Several rivers like the Marana, Pastaza, Nuguere, etc. flow into the main Amazon River. It was established in 2001-2007 that the Amazon is formed in the glacial lake of the snow-capped Navato Misimi peak in the Andean mountain range of Peru. It is west of Lake Titicaca and southeast of Lima. Water from the Navado Misimi flows into the Cupiradas Carcusanta and Apaceda Rivers, which join the Rio Apurimac, a tributary of the Ugayali River. The Ugayali joins the Marañon to form the main Amazon River. This location is considered by most geologists to be the origin of the primary Amazon. The river here is called Solimos dos Aguas in Brazil. After a thousand miles the dark colored Rio Negro joins the muddy Amazon. For six miles the two run in unbroken succession. Floods Not all Amazon tributaries flood at the same time. Most of them start flooding in November and last till June. The Rio Negro begins to flood in February or March and recedes by June. The Medirera floods and recedes two months before other Amazon tributaries. The average depth of the river during monsoon is 40 feet. The main river is approximately one to six miles wide. Larger ocean-going cells can reach as far as Manaus. Smaller 3000 ton or 9000 ton cells with the lower part of the cell up to 18 feet above the water level can travel up to 3600 km in the river. Estuary There is a difference of opinion among experts regarding the width of its estuary due to the geography of the estuary. The Para River is counted along with the Amazon. Sometimes the Para River is considered a separate tributary of the Tocantins River. The estuary of the Para River is larger. The Para and Amazon rivers are connected by various canals. Between these lies Marajó Island. Its area is as big as Switzerland. Wildlife One-third of the world's species live in the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon basin and rainforest cover more than 5.4 million square km (2.1 million sq mi). More than 3,000 species of fish have been found in the Amazon River. The Amazon River Dolphin lives in the Amazon and Orinoco River basins. It is the largest of the river dolphin species. It can grow up to 100 feet. Birnka is the most common type of fish found here. They live in groups. These can attack animals like cows and deer. Humans have also been attacked. However, some species of pirangas attack humans. The red-bellied branca is particularly virulent in humans. Anaconda snakes are found along the shores of the Amazon basin. It is one of the largest snake species. They mostly live in water. Only its nose is above the water level. Amazon rainforest Main article: Amazon rainforest The Amazon rainforest begins east of the Andes mountain range. It is the world's largest rainforest and ecologically important. It is capable of consuming a large amount of carbon-dioxide emitted in the world. Protecting these rainforests is a major issue these days. The very humid Amazon Basin is a bastion of these rainforests. In this region, the Amazon River and its hundreds of tributaries flow very slowly and then flow into the ocean. This biologically rich rainforest is home to 25 lakh species of insects, thousands of plant species and approximately two thousand birds and mammals. A fifth of the world's bird species live in these forests. The Amazon rainforest is located mostly in Brazil, making it the second largest forested area (4,776,980 sq km) after Russia.

"A pyramid (pyramid, Greek: πυραμίς pyramis[1]) is a pyramidal structure. Its base is mostly square. However, it can also take the form of triangles and other types of polygons. Because most of the mass of these buildings is located at the base, their center of gravity is close to the ground, so some ancient civilizations chose this form for erecting solid monuments. For thousands of years the world's largest structures were pyramids. The largest structures were first the Red Pyramid at Tasur Nakuropolis in Egypt and then the Great Pyramid of Ghubu. Of the old Seven Wonders of the World, only the Great Pyramid of Khufu remains standing today. It is mostly built of limestone; Some of the chambers are made of red granite. An architectural marvel, the Great Pyramid is built on 13 acres of land with 1,300,000 stones weighing from 2.5 tonnes (5,500lb) to 15 tonnes (33,000lb). Each side of its square foot is approximately 230m (755ft) long. Its height when built was 146.5m (488ft). But the white Dura limestone at the top was stolen and used for construction in Cairo, making it 137m (455ft) tall today. However, it is the tallest pyramid. Among the pyramids built in the world, the largest by volume is the Great Pyramid of Zolula in Mexico. This pyramid is still being excavated. Pyramid-shaped buildings were built by many other civilizations, including the Egyptians, Mayans, and Sumerians. A glass pyramid is erected in front of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA is built of glass in the design of an Egyptian pyramid. Ancient Buildings Mesopotamia The Mesopotamians were the first to build the early pyramids called sikkurs. They were built using sun-dried bricks and all perished. Such sikkurs were built by the Sumerians, Babylonians, Elamites, Akkadians, and Assyrians in their respective regions. Egypt The Egyptian pyramids are the most famous and well known. Built of brick or rock, some of these are among the largest in the world. The surfaces of most of the pyramids were made of highly reflective white limestone. Thus they were seen from a distance with a glow. The crest or peak itself was made of granite or volcanic rock and plated with gold, silver, or a gold-silver alloy.[2] The Egyptians started building after 2700 BC [3] and built the pyramids until 1700 BC. During the Third Dynasty, King Yosar built the first pyramid by stacking six mastabas on top of each other. The Great Pyramids of Egypt are located at Giza. Most of the pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile. As of 2008, 135 pyramids have been discovered in Egypt.[4][5] The base of the Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest pyramid in Egypt, covers an area of ​​52,600 square meters (566,000sqft). It is considered one of the ancient wonders of the world. The limestone and limestone [6] embedded in the crest have fallen over time or been stolen and used for buildings in Cairo. Most of the pyramids are close to Cairo.[7] Although the pyramids of Sudan are associated with Egypt, Sudan has the largest number of pyramids in the world. 220 pyramids still exist today.[8] The Nubians built these 220 pyramids in three locations in Sudan. Napata and Mero built these as tombs for the king/queens. These differ from the Egyptian pyramids. The Nubian pyramids are set at steeper angles than those.[9] Pyramids were being built in Sudan as far back as 300 BC. The Sude Pyramids can be found in Abuja, Nigeria as part of the Kubo civilization that lived there. There are ten pyramids built of clay. The first stage base has a circumference of 60 feet and a height of 3 feet. The next step is built with a radius of 45 feet. Such layers are built on top of each other in a circular pattern. These were believed to be the abode of the Gods and their residence on the peak. A rye was planted there as a symbol of this. These were built in groups of five parallel to each other. These were built of clay and had to be regenerated from time to time.[10] The Greek geographer Pausanias of the second century BC mentions two structures that resemble the pyramids; One of these was located 19 km (12 mi) southwest of Hellenicone[11] and was built in memory of warriors who fought for the Argosian rule. No evidence has yet been found that these two pyramids were congruent. Two pyramid-like buildings that can still be seen today are at Hellenicone and Licurio. Although they have sloping walls, they in no way resemble the Egyptian pyramids. Inside these are large rooms. The base of the pyramid at Hellenicon is not square but rectangular, 12.5x14m; Thus its side walls could not have met at a single point.[12] Many large temples with pyramidal towers built in black stone during the Chola period in India are still in religious use today. Some of these are Pragatheeswarar Temple in Thanjavur, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Airavatheswarar Temple in Tarasuram and Aranganathaswamy Temple in Sirirangam District of Tamil Nadu. Built by Rajaraja Cholan in the 11th century, Tanjore Prahadeeswarar Temple was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987. As an extension of this, in 2004 Ganga Konda Cholapuram Temple and Tarasuram Airavatheswarar Temple were merged.[13] INDONESIA The Australasian rock architecture culture of Indonesia consisted of mud and stone layered pyramidal structures called Bunden Perundah next to gouges, stone platforms, and lithics. These were found in the Gunung Padang area of ​​West Java and Sisulok Panguyangan areas. These shrines were built on the basis of the local people's belief that the spirits of ancestors lived in mountains and high places. Borobudur in Central Sava has an 8th century Buddhist pyramid. Later Sava structures were built with the influence of Indian architecture.

"Charles Robert Darwin (February 12, 1809 - April 19, 1882) was an English naturalist. The principle of evolution of organisms [1] proposed by him is a fundamental revolutionary scientific principle. He published the facts and principles he discovered in a book titled The Origin of Species in 1859.[2][3] It is a revolutionary book that is very popular. He traveled to many places in the world on the ship HMS Beagle, especially the Galapagos Islands, and made amazing biological discoveries. His fearless comments that the human race was related to the monkey race made him laugh at that day. However, his ideas are of great value in the scientific world today.[4] He is the man who evolved from the ape, who discovered new scientific theories such as the evolution of animals and living things in the world based on the principle of 'survival of the fittest',[5][6] meaning that the fittest survives.[7] Young Darwin was born on February 12, 1809 in Shrewsbury, England.[8] His father, Robert Darwin, was a physician; His father is also a doctor. Darwin lost his mother at a very young age. He received his primary education in Shrewsbury.[9] From an early age he was very interested in animals and insects. His father wanted his son Charles to become a doctor like himself and enrolled him at Edinburgh University; But Darwin, who was an excellent student in the field of natural science and geology, was not interested in the field of medicine.[10] From an early age, Darwin had a keen interest in worms, insects and animals. Even after moving to Edinburgh he began collecting stones, plants, worms and insects.[11] While studying medicine, Darwin was once forced to watch an operation on a child. He lost interest in medicine when he saw and heard the suffering of the child as surgeries were performed without anesthesia. Although he was disappointed by his father, he later advised him to study theology. Darwin accepted it and joined the University of Cambridge.[12] A brilliant scholar, his interest lay in the study of the origin of living things. Darwin graduated in Theology at the age of 22 and refused to join the Christian Church. Darwin became close friends with John Stevens Henslow, who was then a professor of botany at the same university.[13] He did well in the January 1831 final examination for the Ordinary Degree, coming tenth out of 178 examinees.[14] Through him, he got the friendship of Captain Robert FitzRoy. HMS Beagle was about to set sail to explore the South American coast. Darwin was invited to join the expedition led by Captain Robert Fitzroy. Accepting it, on 27th December 1831, Captain Fitzroy and Darwin started the journey.[15] They began their journey with the decision to return in two years.[16] But it was that historic journey of five years that became the basis for the development of the theory of evolution.[5][17][18] Darwin was 22 years old when he started his journey. In five years, the ship sailed around the world. Charles Darwin bravely embarked on a dangerous and arduous voyage. Undaunted by the hardships of the journey, he collected the bones of many species that are now unknown.[17][19][20] Darwin was amazed to see the similarities and differences between all living things, reptiles, birds, and walking.[21] In order to understand such similarities and differences, it seemed to him essential to know whether all living organisms descended from a common ancestor and whether they had developed into their present day with a series of small, minor changes.[22][23] ""How and why do changes in organisms occur?"" Darwin became interested in finding an answer to the question. Studies Darwin was involved in the study of extinct species that are not seen today, as well as those that are still alive, using their bones. At first he assumed that some of the bones he had collected must have been extinct animals. But then he reasoned that it was from those animals that the present-day small-sized animals must have evolved. He was amazed to see new species of birds, plants and animals in Galapagos Island. As a result of this research, he came up with the ""Evolutionary Development Theory"".[24][25] After such various researches, Darwin returned to England in 1836.[26][27][28] After completing his voyage to the American coast and European islands, Darwin wrote the information he had collected and his findings as a research paper and published the book The voyage of the Beagle in London.[29][30] Married at the age of 30 to Emma Wedgwood (Emma Wedgwood) [31] Darwin fathered seven children. Even after marriage, Darwin continued to indulge in his favorite naturalistic studies. His children include: William Erasmus Darwin (27 December 1839 – 1914) Anne Elizabeth Darwin (2 March 1841 – 23 1851) Mary Elinor Darwin (23 September 1842 – 16 October 1842) Enrita Emma ""Etty"" Darwin (25 September 1843 – 1929) Win (9 July 1845 – 7 December 1912) Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Darwin (8 July 1847–1926) Francis Darwin (16 August 1848 – 19 September 1925) Leonard Darwin (15 January 1850 – 26 March 1943) Ores Darwin (13 May 1851 – 29 September 1928) Charles Waring Darwin (6 December 1856 – 28 June 1858) The books befriended Charles Darwin and another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin worked with his friend to gather further evidence for the principles he had already gathered from the evidence he had gathered along the American coast.[32] Darwin published his discoveries based on studies of the order and norms of the formation of new species, and the tendency of certain species within such species to completely change from the original state. The Theory of Evolution On July 1, 1858, Darwin's above findings and his friend Wallace's paper were read at the Linnean Society of London. As a result of further study, Darwin came up with the 'Principle of Evolution'. In 1859, Darwin published this theory in a book that stunned the world. The theory of evolution is the principle stated in the book ""The Origin of Species by Natural Selection"". Accordingly, in the life struggle of living beings, those who are fit and strong will survive. Others will perish.""[5][33] Darwin said that this would lead to the creation of new species.[5][34] Based on these ideas, species continue to change. Darwin's ideas impressed the public; People read his studies with wonder and interest. People were greatly surprised to know that in the evolution of the creatures living in this world, especially the fauna, those who are in harmony with nature are living in safety, while others are disappearing. But the world did not feel the effect of that ideology then. It was believed to apply only to plants and animals. Even Darwin makes no mention of man in the book. Were we born from apes when the world began to realize that the principle of evolution should apply to man? The question arose. I don't believe Darwin ever said so directly. But intellectually, scientists began to think that it must have happened. As expected, Darwin's slander was condemned by the churches. His book was published all over the world during his lifetime. Cambridge University awarded him an honorary doctorate. This book is still a controversial and thought provoking book. Darwin's theory of evolution has three aspects. Variation (found in all organisms) Heredity (the ability to pass on a similar life form from one generation to another) Struggle for survival (making changes in organisms by predicting which changes will favor a particular environment and determining reproductive systems accordingly) This is what today's civilized and scientific world explains to us as an extension of the nature of heredity. This is called 'Modern Darwinism'. The struggle for survival depends not only on the individual object; Today's modern Darwinism is concerned with the power (including character, physique, color, ability, intelligence) that produces and reproduces one's species. Other books on Darwin's discoveries are 'The Heredity of Man' and 'The Migratory Power of Plants'. Darwin also clarified that earthworms living in the soil are the main reason for soil fertility and crop growth. His book ""The Role of Worms in Plant Growth"" illustrates how soil research and the study of earthworms are related to each other.[36] Death Charles Darwin died on April 19, 1882. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, England.[37][38][39] The media is young Emma (wife) With eldest son (age 33) After the death of her daughter, she stopped attending the Christian Church after 1851. 1855 at the age of 46 1862-66 Ill.. 1874 1881 Caricature, 1871 Signature, 1837 His house His room Rainwater harvesting tank near his laboratory References and citations External links The Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online – ; Darwin's publications, private papers and bibliography, supplementary works including biographies, obituaries and reviews Full text and notes for complete correspondence to 1867, with summaries of all the rest ; public domain from LibriVox Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in libraries (WorldCat catalog) , Natural History Museum – a short video discussing Darwin and Agassiz' coral reef formation debate (3 min 20 sec). – A 3 part drama-documentary exploring Charles Darwin and the significant contributions of his colleagues Joseph Hooker, Thomas Huxley and Alfred Russel Wallace also featuring interviews with ரிச்சர்ட் டாக்கின்சு, David Suzuki, Jared Diamond Account of the Beagle voyage using animation, in English from Center national de la recherche scientifique CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) View books owned and annotated by at the online Biodiversity Heritage Library.

"Delhi or Delhi (Hindi: دیلی, Punjabi: دیلی, Urdu: دیلی) is the second largest city in India. It is one of the three cities in the National Capital Region. The other two cities are New Delhi and Delhi Cantonment. The National Capital Region is the eighth most populous city in the world with a population of 11 million. It is administered by a central government. Located on the banks of the Yamuna River in northern India, this city has been a residential area for a long time. BC Archaeological evidence of people living in the area dates back to the sixth century AD. After the rise of the Delhi Sultanate, the city emerged as an important political, cultural and commercial city on the trade route between northwest India and the Indus-Gangetic plains. Here, a large number of ancient and medieval monuments and archaeological sites are located. In 1639, the Mughal emperor Shahjahan established a walled city here. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857. After most of India came under the control of the British East India Company in the 18th and 19th centuries, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) was their headquarters. This continued under the Company's rule and then for some time under the British Government. In 1911, King George V announced the transfer of the capital to Delhi. In the 1920s, a new capital known as New Delhi was built south of Old Delhi. After India's independence in 1947, it was declared the capital and seat of government. Due to the migration of people from different parts of the country, Delhi became a multi-ethnic city. The high average income of the people living here and the rapid growth and urbanization of Delhi have changed the city greatly. Today it is an important cultural, political and commercial center of India. The origin of the name Delhi is not clear. However, many reasons are given for the origin of this name. By a Mauryan king named Dillu or Dilu in 100 BC. Most believe that the city founded in the region in 50 AD was named Delhi after him. Another theory is that the foundation of an iron pillar erected here by King Dava was unstable and the city was called Dili which means loosening in Hindi / Prakrit and hence the name Delhi. During the time of the Rajput kings, the coin that circulated in the region was called Tehliwal. Some scholars believe that the name is derived from the words Tehlis or Tehali, meaning mouth. They suggest that the name may have been derived from the fact that it served as a gateway to the Indus-Gangetic Plain region. Others are of the opinion that the initial name of the city was Delhi. History According to the archaeological evidence available so far in Delhi and its surrounding areas BC. Settlements appear to have existed in the second millennium and earlier. Indraprastam, the capital of the Pandavas in the famous Indian epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been situated in this region. These settlements flourished during the Mauryan Empire (300 BC). Remains of seven major cities have been found in the Delhi area. The Tomara family established the city of Lal Ghat in AD 736. The Chauhan Rajputs or Ajmer as they are known captured the city of Lal Ghat in 1180 AD and renamed it as Gila Rai Pithora. The Chauhan king Prithiviraj III was defeated by the Afghan Muhammad Khori in 1192. In 1206, Qutb-ud-Din Aibag, who started the Ghulam dynasty, established the Delhi Sultanate. Qutb-ud-Din built the Qutb Minar and the oldest mosque in India known as Quad Al Islam. After the fall of the Ghulam dynasty, Khilji, Tughlaq, Sayyid, Lodi, and other Turkic and Central Asian dynasties ruled one after the other. They built many forts and townships, including seven cities in Delhi. The Timur League entered India in 1398, accusing the Muslim Sultans of Delhi of being lenient towards their Hindu subjects. They entered Delhi and destroyed it. During the period of Delhi Sultans, Delhi was a major center of supium. In 1526, Shahruddin Babur founded the Mughal Empire by defeating the last sultan of the Lodi dynasty at the First Battle of Panipat. Delhi, Agra and Lahore were the capitals of this empire. The Mughal Empire lasted three centuries in northern India, except for the five-year reign of Sher Shah Suri in the mid-16th century. Emperor Akbar shifted the capital from Agra to Delhi. Today, it was Emperor Shahjahan who built the seventh city of Delhi, commonly known as Old Delhi. Then the city was named Shahjakhanabad after the emperor. Old Delhi was the capital of the Mughal Empire since 1638. In February 1739, Nadar Shah defeated the Mughal forces at the Battle of Karnal and captured Delhi. He plundered Delhi and took many valuables including peacocks. After the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, Ahmed Shah Abdali captured Delhi. On 11 September 1803, the British forces led by General Lake Enbar defeated the Marathas in the Battle of Delhi and captured the city. After the Indian Mutiny of 1857, Delhi came under the direct control of the British. Shortly after this, Calcutta became the capital of British India. Delhi became a district of Punjab province. In 1911, Delhi was declared the capital of British India. Following this, a group led by British architect Edwin Lutyens began designing a new political and administrative capital to build government buildings. This new city, New Delhi, became the capital of British India. It continued to be the capital even after the independence of India on 15 August 1947. During the Partition of India, a large number of Muslims migrated from Delhi to Pakistan, while a large number of Hindus and Sikhs migrated to Delhi from the provinces of West Punjab and Sindh. The Constitution of India (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 formally declared the Union Territory of Delhi as the National Capital Territory of Delhi. According to this act, an assembly with limited powers was also constituted for the area. Due to the feeling of enmity between India and Pakistan and the dispute over Kashmir, Delhi is also facing a security threat. In December 2001, the Indian Parliament building was attacked by Kashmiri militants. India blamed Pakistan for the attack in which six security personnel were killed. A subsequent bomb attack in October 2005 killed 62 civilians and another similar attack in September 2008 killed 30 civilians. Demography According to the 2011 India census, the total population of Delhi state is 16,787,941. 2.50% people live in rural areas and 97.50% people live in urban areas. In the last decade (2001-2011), the population growth rate has increased to 21.21%. The population consists of 8,987,326 males and 7,800,615 females. Sex Ratio There are 868 females per 1,000 males. The state has an area of ​​1,483 square kilometers and a population density of 11,320 people per square kilometer. The average literacy rate of the state is 86.21 %, male literacy is 90.94 % and female literacy is 80.76 %. The number of children under the age of six is ​​2,012,454. [1] time The population of the Hindu religion is 13,712,100 (81.68 %), the Islamic religious population is 2,158,684 (12.86 %), and the population of the Christianity is 146,093 (0.87 %), and the Sikh religious population is 570,581 (3.40 %) (0.99 %), Buddhist population is 18,449 (0.11 %), other religion population is 2,197 (0.01 %) and non-religious population is 13,606 (0.08 %). languages Along with Hindi, the official language of this state, Urdu, Punjabi and the official languages ​​of all Indian states are also spoken. Politics The state of Delhi has seventy legislative members, two parliamentary Lok Sabha constituencies and two parliamentary Rajya Sabha constituencies.[2] Geography and Climate The National Capital Region of Delhi covers an area of ​​1,484 sq km (573 sq mi). Of this, 783 sq km (302 sq mi) is rural and 700 sq km (270 sq mi) is urban. The maximum length of the National Capital Territory of Delhi is 51.9 km (32 mi) and the width is 48.48 km (30 mi). There are three local bodies in this area. These are Municipal Corporation of Delhi (1,397.3 sq km or 540 sq mi), New Delhi Municipal Committee (42.7 sq km or 16 sq mi), and Delhi Cantonment Council (43 sq km or 17 sq mi). Delhi is located in North India. It also includes Uttar Pradesh in the east; Ariana is also bounded in the west, north and south directions. Delhi lies almost entirely on the Ganges plain. Two important geographical features of Delhi are the Yamuna floodplain and the Delhi ridge. The low-lying Yamuna floodplain provides fertile alluvial soil for agriculture. However, this plain is prone to frequent floods. The ridge, reaching a height of 318 meters (1,043 ft), is the most prominent feature of the area. It starts from the Aravalli range in the south and goes around the western, northeastern and northwestern parts of the city. The Yamuna River, considered sacred by Hindus, is the only major river that flows through Delhi. Most of the city that includes New Delhi lies on the western bank of the Yamuna. The urban area is located on the eastern side of the Shahdara River. Delhi is located in Seismic Zone-4 and is prone to major earthquakes. Delhi has a continental climate. There is a large temperature difference between summer and monsoon. A long summer between early April and mid-October; There are monsoonal periods in between. Marikalam starts in late October and reaches its peak in January. Heavy fog is also seen during this period. Temperatures vary from −0.6 °C (30.9 °F) to 47 °C (117 °F). The average annual temperature is 25 °C (77 °F), while the average monthly temperature varies between 13 °C – 32 °C (56 °F – 90 °F). Average annual rainfall is 714 mm (28.1 in). Most of this falls during the monsoon season in July and August. Transportation Aerial 37 million people travel by air from here annually.[4] roadway Following are the roads in Delhi. Inner Ring Roads Outer Ring Roads Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway National Highways National Highway – 1 National Highway – 2 National Highway – 8 National Highway – 10 Railway Indian Railways operates trains from Delhi and from other places to Delhi. Railway stations in Delhi state are under the control of Northern Railway. Delhi has five train stations namely New Delhi, Delhi Junction, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anandu Vihar Terminal and Delhi Sarai Rogilla.[5] Local trains run to the suburbs of Delhi through the Delhi Metro Rail Project. These trains can be used to travel from one part of Delhi to another part of the city and to the cities of Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida and Ghaziabad.[6] Citations External links Category:Capitals of Indian states Category:Indian towns and cities Category:Delhi ",What is the area of ​​Delhi city?,"1,484 sq km",9006
"A fire is a phenomenon in which rapid oxidation occurs in materials during combustion, a chemical process that releases heat, and burns, releasing heat and light with flames [1]. Unlike these rapid oxidation processes, oxidation processes such as rusting and corrosion occur slowly and do not produce fire. Fire was invented in the Stone Age. Man of that time discovered fire by rubbing rocks and stones. He scared the animals with it. He cooked food. Fire is a process that emits heat. Fire requires oxygen called prana vayu to burn. In ancient times, two pebbles were scraped together and a fire was made with dry leaves and sticks. Later, with the development of science, matches were made with sulfur and fire was started using matchbox. Fire was also worshiped as a god by the name ""Agni"". Fire is also considered as one of the Pancha Buddhas. The visible part of fire is the flame/flame or flame/flame. It depends on the nature of the fuel and its external pollutants, and the size of the burning flame or the color of the flame, the density and intensity of the fire. In the flame of fire there is excess heat on the surface. When fire occurs out of control, it causes material destruction, danger to plants, animals, human beings, and loss of life. Whereas fire in nature helps the ecosystem to renew or restore itself] [2]. Origin of fire Fire generally appears in the following stages. 1. Controlled combustion - A fire that occurs when a fuel is burned. Eg: Burning wood or other fuel for cooking, or to generate heat. 2. Uncontrolled Combustion It can be accidental fire. Eg: oil well, or spontaneous fire in buildings. It can be a natural looking fire. Eg: Forest fire It can be a massive fire caused by deliberate burning. E.g.: When houses are burnt, it will then automatically burn out of control into a large fire. Flame Fire refers to a red flame or flame. A flame emits visible light, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet. It is a mixture of gases and solid matter that emits a frequency spectrum. Natural pollution Fire turns all matter into charcoal. Fire therefore increases the amount of carbon in the Earth. So the environment gets polluted. History of Fire in India Fire is believed by Hindus to destroy evil and add sanctity. So Indians use Agni in many auspicious events including marriage. Fire has been considered sacred since Vedic times. The Sovrastris of India worship only fire as their deity. Types of fire Fires are created for many reasons. The fire produced by friction is the principal of all. Natural fire Artificial fire Natural fire Forest fires are types of natural fire. Sun is an example of natural fire. Artificial fire Fires such as those created by matches are artificial fires. Images about fire are wildfires A burning scene about an oil well in Kuwait A fire broke out at the school Setting fire Ignition from a match Firestorm In forests, fire is ignited by the friction created when trees or dry grasses rub against each other. Such fire called WILD FIRE is very dangerous. Sometimes, depending on the wind speed and ambient temperature, this forest fire can form a fireball and turn into a fire spiral. Due to the rapid circulation of the wind, such vertical fireballs can sometimes become a heat cyclone thirty to two hundred feet high and about ten feet wide. Depending on the direction and speed of the wind, this fire cyclone can last for a long time. The temperature of such a fire cyclone is very high. Due to this, all the trees and plants in the path it passes will be burnt and die in a short time. This firestorm, It is capable of causing natural disasters in a very short period of time. Not only plants including trees and plants but also birds, animals, insects etc. living in the forest will be caught and die in droves.[3] Rhododendron is a tree that does not come close to fire A forest fire that occurs suddenly in the forest destroys everything around it like plants, vines and trees. But trees that have the adaptation to keep fire away from them are found in the Himalayan ranges of India and the Western Ghats. When a fire spreads near such a tree called Himalayan Rhododendran, a water-like liquid will start to flow from its bark, which has been adapted in many layers. Thus, such trees escape from the destruction caused by fire without coming close to the fire. Such trees with their red blossoms in the wide meadow attract the birds and are the habitats of most of the birds. Likewise, they are strong enough to withstand strong winds. The flower juice produced from the red flowers of this tree is rich in medicinal properties. In Tamil it is called Kattup Poovarasu. The Padukans living in the Nilgiris call it Bili in their language. The indigenous inhabitants of the Todar tribe call the flowers found on this tree as porus. In the Western Ghats (Nilgiris, Anaimalai, Palani Hills, Meghamalai etc.) i.e. in places more than 1500 meters above sea level, these trees are widespread. It is also given as a native tree of the Nilgiris. Apart from India, rhododendron trees are also found in countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar, China and Thailand.[4] Discovering a new kind of fire In a study of fire vortices by some scientists, blue and purple flames have been discovered swirling in a fire vortice that no one has seen before, yet it burns in a quiet and precise manner. For the first time, a team of researchers from the University of Maryland has demonstrated that scientists have created a blue storm flame that burns more cleanly than the archaic yellow fire. This fire has potential for an efficient, highly environmentally friendly oil spill cleanup system.[5] Read more at: Read more at: See more Fire making Matchstick Bond Quotations Category:Fire ",When was fire discovered?,In the Stone Age,422
"Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (March 6, 1475 – February 18, 1564) was an Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, poet, and architect. He is commonly known as Michelangelo. Due to the high quality of his artistic versatility, he is considered the father of the Renaissance along with his contemporary Leonardo da Vinci. Throughout Michelangelo's long career, all of his creations are a testament to his prodigious skill. He wrote a lot of correspondences, maps and memoirs. Together, he is the most documented artist of the 16th century. Michelangelo's most famous works, the Pietà and David, were created in the late twenties and early thirties of the 16th century. Although he did not have a high opinion of painting, he created two paintings that had a great influence on the field of Western painting. These are the Last Judgment paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome and on the wall behind its plinth. Later in his life he designed the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Two biographies of him were published during his lifetime. Giorgio Vasari, who wrote one of these, hailed him as the pinnacle of Renaissance achievement. This concept was adopted in art in the following centuries. Early life Michelangelo was born in 1475 in the town of Caprese in the province of Arezzo in the central Italian region of Tuscany. His father, Lodovico di Leonardo di Buonarotti di Simoni, was a judge. His mother was Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena. The Buvanarotti family descended from an aristocratic family of Tuscany. However, in Michelangelo's time, his family was considered an insignificant aristocratic family. Early Michelangelo grew up in Florence. Later, during his mother's long illness and death, Michelangelo lived with a stonecutter's family in the town of Settignano. His father owned a marble quarry and a small farm in this city. Having studied grammar for a while, Michelangelo was trained in painting by Domenico Ghirlandaio and sculpture by Bertoldo di Giovanni, against his father's wishes. On 28 June 1488, he signed a three-year contract to work with a famous painter. Impressed by his talent, his tutor Domenico recommended him to the ruler of the city, Lorenzo de' Medici. Leaving his apprenticeship in 1489, Michelangelo studied at Lorenzo's school from 1490 to 1492. During this time he met many famous people. Through them, his ideas about art were changed and expanded. Michelangelo's creativity Michelangelo studied human anatomy for about twelve years as a preliminary to his painting. This learning experience and technique brought his paintings to life. Because of this, in his paintings and sculptures, the skeletal structure of the human body, the structure of the body muscles, the design of the skin, etc. were developed in a precise manner. Moreover, Michelangelo himself created the color compositions for the painting. He did not want to allow his servants or his students to do this work.[2] Works Rome His Works Michelangelo arrived in Rome on June 25, 1496, at the age of 21. On July 4 of the same year, he began work on an isometric statue of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, for Cardinal Raphael Riario. It was later rejected by the Cardinal as completed, and later, bank magnate Jacopo Galli bought it for his garden collection. In November 1497, the French saint Piata commissioned him to carve a sculpture depicting the Virgin Mary grieving over the body of Jesus, and Michelangelo was 24 years old when it was completed. This sculpture is considered one of the world's finest works. Michelangelo lived in Rome near the church of Santa Maria di Loreto. Here, she is said to have fallen in love with a poet named Vettoria Glona. And his sculpture, Logon and His Sons, is now in the Vatican. Peculiarities of the Pieta statue The word Pieta means mercy in Italian.[3] This Pieta statue was created by Michelangelo out of washed stone. This marble statue is kept in a church called St. Anne-de-Beupre Basilica near Quebec City, Canada. Not far from Quebec City is the town of Sainte-Anne-de-Bopre. The site is one of the most significant Canadian and North American Catholic sites of worship.[3] The appearance of this Pieta statue depicts Jesus lying on the lap of Mother Mary. In it, one of Mary's hands supports the body of Jesus. His other face is seen looking back towards the sky. Angelo depicts Mother Mary here as a young woman. The depiction is seen as a symbol of Virgin Mary's virginity to the world. It is noteworthy that the statue of Ippietta is preserved in St. Peter's Basilica. Because only this one statue bears Michelangelo's signature.[3] The statue of David Michelangelo returned to Florence in 1499-1501. After the fall of Savonarolan, the anti-republican Renaissance priest and leader of Florence Girolamo, and the rise of the gonfaloniere Piero Soderini in 1498, a change of government took place, so a colossal statue depicting David as a symbol of Florence's independence was commissioned by Agoctino di Duccio. He was asked to finish an unfinished project that started 40 years ago. Michelangelo completed the statue of David in 1504. Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel In 1505, Michelangelo was called back to Rome by the newly elected Pope Julius II. He was given permission to build the Pope's mausoleum. Michelangelo's work on the mausoleum was constantly interrupted by Pope's various tasks. Because of those complications, he worked at the cemetery for 40 years. During the same period, Michelangelo took about four years (1508-1512) to complete the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Michelangelo originally commissioned the twelve apostles against a starry sky background, but later proposed a different and more complex scheme to depict the creation of man, the promised fall of the prophets, and the canonical representation of Christ. Among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are the Garden of Eden, the Creation of Adam and Eve, the Great Flood, and the Prophet Isaiah. Christ's ancestors were painted around the window. The Last Judgment (1534-41) The Last Judgment fresco on the altar wall in the Sistine Hall was commissioned by Paul III Michelangelo. Michelangelo worked on the painting from 1534 to October 1541. The Sistine Hall spans the entire wall behind the altar. There is a picture of the Last Judgment and the Revelation of Christ. As it turned out, the painting of Christ and the Virgin Mary, which was depicted naked, was considered a sacrilege, and Michelangelo decided to hide its genitalia after death. An original censored copy of it can be found in Naples' Capodimonte Museum.

"Main Page  The Hindu is a Chennai-based newspaper published in English and Tamil. [2] Started in 1878, the newspaper sells about fourteen and a half lakh copies daily. The Hindu Group, which publishes this newspaper, is managed by Kasturi and Sons. It ranks second in sales and third in readership among English newspapers in India. History The Hindu newspaper was first published on September 20, 1878. Pro-British English newspapers published news articles condemning the first appointment of an Indian to the Madras High Court. Enraged by this, six young men from the Triplicane Literary Society (TLS) decided to have a magazine to express the opinion of Indians. G. They started a newspaper called The Hindu with Subramania Iyer as editor. Initially, The Hindu was published as a weekly magazine on Wednesdays. Although it condemned the English press, it praised the British government without openly opposing it. It began to be published three times a week from 1883.[3] In 1887, the annual conference of the Indian National Congress was held at Chennai. Since then news about national politics started appearing in Hindu. In 1898, Subramania Iyer defected from Hindu and became the owner of Veeraragavacharya. In the 1900s, Hindu's sales declined and a financial crisis ensued. In 1905, Veerragavacharya sold Hindu to Kasturiranga Iyengar. Kasturiranga Iyengar's family has been managing the Hindu ever since. The Hindu began to be published daily in the early twentieth century. The Hindu supported Annie Besant Ammaiyar's struggle for independence in the 1910s. Leaders of Justice Party D. M. When Nair and Thiagaraya Chetty demanded caste-wise reservation in the Assembly, Hindu strongly opposed it. It published messages in support of the Indian freedom struggle and against the British government. In 1948 the practice of publishing a full advertisement on the front page was discontinued and the format was reformed. 1987 exposed the Bofors cannon scandal. From 1995, it started appearing on the Internet. From 1965 to 1993 G. Kasthuri and N. in 1993-2001. Ravi was also the managing director of the Hindu Group. Since 2003 N. Ram is the managing director and editor-in-chief of The Hindu.[4] Sales and Editions According to Indian Readership Survey 2008, Hindu Day sells fourteen and a half lakh copies. It ranks second among English newspapers in India in terms of sales (Times of India being the first). It is third in the number of students. The Hindu publishes twenty editions from Chennai, Coimbatore, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Madurai, Noida, Visakhapatnam, Trivandrum, Kochi, Vijayawada, Mangalore, Trichy, Kolkata, Hubli, Moghal, Allahabad, Malappuram, Lucknow, Anantapur, Nellore.[5] [6] Managing Directors The Hindu Group currently has twelve Managing Directors. The successors of Kasthuri Ranga Iyengar – N. Ram, N. Ravi, N. Murali, Malini Parthasarathy, Nirmala Lakshmanan, Nalini Krishnan, Ramesh Rangarajan, Vijaya Arun, Akila Iyengar, K. Balaji, K. Venugopal and Lakshmi Srinath.[7] Dependent positions Columns in The Hindu are written against religiousism and in favor of secularism. Narasimhan Ram, one of its editors, is accused of writing columns generally supporting the policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party in domestic politics[8] and opposing the Marxist Communist Party,[9] in foreign affairs, opposing the liberation of Tamil Eelam and supporting the Sino-Sri Lankan countries.[10] Group Magazines Other magazines published by The Hindu Group Business Line (Economics and Business Journal) The Hindu International Edition (Weekly Magazine) Sportstar (Sports News Weekly) Frontline (bi-monthly political and social magazine) Praxis (a quarterly management magazine) Ergo Online Magazine The Hindu (Tamil Daily) Internal disputes, revelations The Hindu No. Ram his brother N.

"Tuberculosis is a malignant disease spread through the feces of an infected person. The disease is transmitted when water or food contaminated with faecal particles is ingested orally. It is widely known as Polio in English. Poliomyelitis (Poliomyelitis) is the medical name of this disease. It is a paralysis caused when the poliomyelitis virus attacks the spinal cord. 90% of people infected with the disease show no symptoms. However, when toxins mix with the bloodstream, many types of symptoms appear. In less than 1% of affected individuals, the malignancy invades the central nervous system and attacks motor neurons, weakening the ligaments and producing severe flaccid paralysis. A variety of paralytic conditions can occur depending on the nerves that are affected. Juvenile rheumatism involving the spine is the most common. It usually affects the legs. Polio is a contagious disease that can be crippling and fatal. Spread from person to person. It affects the brain and spinal cord causing paralysis. Humans are the only known reservoir of poliovirus. Spread from one infected person to another. There are two basic forms of polio infection Tuberculosis that does not affect the spinal cord. It is sometimes known as hyponatremia, a chronic disease that affects the spinal cord. It may or may not have a stroke Disease symptoms 72% of children show no symptoms of polio infection. But there is a risk of transmission of the infection to others through the feces of people infected with poliovirus.[1]  Approximately 4-8% of polio infections progress to tuberculosis. Clinical and laboratory tests showed no evidence of central nervous system involvement. This is known as Deficiency Syndrome. It is normal to recover completely within a week. Three symptoms have been identified in such poliovirus infections: upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever), gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea), and influenza-like illness. 1-2 % of infections develop into non-rheumatic disseminated encephalitis (sign of neck, back and/or leg stiffness). These symptoms persist for several days like a minor illness. Excessive or abnormal sensations occur. These symptoms last for 2-10 days and then disappear completely. Less than 1% of all polio cases manifest as muscle wasting. Juvenile rheumatism symptoms usually begin 1-10 days after a minor illness. After the fever has normalized, no further paralysis occurs. Symptoms initially include loss of superficial reflexes with increased tendon activity, severe muscle pain, and limb or back spasms. The reflexes of the hypothalamus are reduced and the disease becomes rheumatism. It remains unchanged for days or weeks. In this case it will look asymmetrical. Then strength begins to return. The patient does not experience any numbness or cognitive changes. The major parts of the body such as arms, legs and spinal cord become weak. In a few days, fever and chills; The head is heavy; There will be unrelenting pain all over the body.[2] problems Juvenile rheumatism can cause permanent muscle paralysis, deformities of the hips, ankles, and feet, and disability. Although many deformities can be corrected through surgery and physical therapy, these treatment methods are not feasible in developing countries. Because of this, children who survive juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have to live with severe disabilities. It causes the following effects. Pneumonia Ventricular hypertension Immobility Lung problems Pulmonary edema shocked Permanent muscle paralysis Urinary tract infection Diagnosis Virus isolation Poliovirus is picked up from the stool or throat of a person with polio. Diagnosis is by isolation of virus from cerebrospinal fluid. But it is rarely possible. Virus isolated from a person with severe rheumatoid arthritis should be tested further. Oligonucleotide mapping or genomic sequencing can determine whether the virus is wild-type or vaccine-type (derived from a vaccine strain). Uneerial Equalizing antibodies are present early and become more abundant as the patient is admitted to the hospital. Thus the four-fold increase cannot be shown by the antibody catalysis test. Cerebrospinal fluid The white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid is usually high (10-20 cells/mm3, mostly platelets) if there is a juvenile infectious disease. Also, protein levels are slightly increased (40–50 mg/100 mL). Disease management Juvenile rheumatism cannot be cured. So the patient is given supportive care. Symptomatic treatment is given until the patient recovers. Medicines, exercises and balanced diet should be given for polio symptoms. prevention Juvenile arthritis has so far been an incurable disease. So prevention is the only way to protect and control the disease. There are two types of vaccines: denatured polio vaccine and oral polio vaccine. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is given by injection, depending on the age. Polio vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines. Immunization should be given in childhood. Children should be given 4 doses of de-immunized juvenile rheumatism at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months and a booster dose at 4-6 years. Oral polio vaccine contains a combination of live and attenuated poliovirus strains from all three poliovirus types. Children below 5 years of age are given oral vaccine twice a year under the polio drip program. Children are safeguarded and provide comprehensive protection in the community. In 1952, Jonas Salk, an American doctor, discovered the polio vaccine. He refused to patent the life-saving vaccine he had invented. My invention was like the sun. Everyone should benefit. It was Salk who refused to ask whether Surya could apply for a patent. In 1957, another American doctor named 'Albert Sabin' (Albert Sabin) discovered a preventive medicine for the same disease. It was easier and less expensive to give children the polio vaccine by drop. Thus, the Indian government made the people aware that 'polio drops can be prevented if children are properly vaccinated'.[3] World Polio Drip Day is observed on June 16 every year across the world. In India, polio drops are administered twice a year to children under 5 years of age to eradicate juvenile polio. In less than 1% of affected individuals, the malignancy invades the central nervous system and attacks motor neurons, weakening the ligaments and producing severe flaccid paralysis. A variety of paralytic conditions can occur depending on the nerves that are affected. Juvenile rheumatism involving the spine is the most common. It usually affects the legs. Juvenile arthritis in India In 2009, 741 cases of juvenile polio were reported in India. The last case of juvenile polio in India was reported on January 13, 2011 in the state of West Bengal. An 18-year-old girl was infected there. India achieved the status of declaring itself polio-free on 13 January 2014 as no child was infected with polio for three consecutive years. Although the Indian government's announcement comes on 13 January 2014, the World Health Organization will issue its certificate on 11 February after testing some of the last test samples from India.[4] The water from the Amberpet canal in Telangana's capital, Hyderabad, was tested and found to be contaminated with poliovirus.[5] Effects There has been no polio in Tamil Nadu for the last 10 years. But in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi and Chandigarh, children were affected by polio till December 2010. Similarly, states like Aryana, Panjai, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and West Bengal had sporadic polio cases in 2010. Vaccination Polio has been completely eradicated in India by oral drops administered to children. Medical researchers have found that one in 10 million children who are vaccinated will contract polio from the vaccine. Therefore, it is best to vaccinate children against polio, researchers suggest. In various countries like America, France, Japan, Germany, England etc. they have stopped giving polio drops by mouth. They only give polio vaccine. Polio vaccination can prevent 100 percent of polio cases. Therefore, the government should take steps to vaccinate children against polio in India as in other countries.[6] Quotations  External links  Category:Infectious diseases ",When was polio eradicated from India?,2011,7988
"The human brain is the head of the human nervous system and the most complex of human organs. The human brain controls unconscious, involuntary activities such as breathing, digestion, heartbeat, and yawning[1],[2] and complex higher-order activities that occur consciously, such as thinking, understanding, and reasoning. The human brain is capable of handling such complex high-level operations better than any other living organism. Although the human brain resembles the general shape of other mammalian brains in many ways, it is at least five times larger in body weight-to-brain volume ratio than their brains. This is due to the well-developed cerebral cortex of the human brain. Formed by neural tissue and consisting of several series of folds, this region is located in the human forebrain. In particular, the frontal lobes of the brain, which are responsible for the specialized functions that distinguish humans from other animals, such as self-control, planning, reasoning, and learning, are well developed in the human brain. Also, the area responsible for eye sight is also well developed in the human brain. In the evolution of the brain, the ratio of brain-body size has gradually increased from the earliest small mammal, the primate, through the great ape to one of the higher animals, man; This is called encephalisation. Of the approximately 50–100 billion (5000–10000 million) neurons (1011) in the human brain, approximately 10 billion neurons (1010) are cortical pyramidal cells. These cells use approximately 100 trillion (1014) synapses to send signals (signals) between them. The human brain is protected by the thick bones of the skull, the cerebrospinal fluid, from vibrations and external damage, and from the blood and blood-borne diseases through the blood-brain barrier system. However, due to its delicate nature, it is inevitable that it will be harmed by various diseases and damages. Common types of brain damage include closed head injuries, head injuries, strokes caused by blood clots in the brain, and exposure to chemical toxins called neurotoxins. Suffering from brain infections is extremely rare. Because the blood-brain barrier in the human brain filters out most of the bacterial germs that can enter the bloodstream and attack the body's organs, the brain is largely protected from infectious microbes. However, when the brain is rarely attacked by bacteria, treatment with antibodies becomes more difficult. This is because the same blood-brain barrier system also blocks the immune system. Viruses can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. These jump together with the white blood cells in the blood. Apart from these, many common genetic diseases can also affect the brain. Among them, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, in which the body's immune system attacks the nervous system, are important. Psychological diseases such as depression, low mood and cognitive impairment are also caused by changes in the brain. system  An average male mandarin brain weighs about 1.5 kilograms,[3] and has a volume of 1260 cubic centimeters. The female brain is approximately 1130 cubic centimeters (cc).[4] When a person is alive, the outer surface of the brain is dark gray and the inner mass is yellow and white. The photograph on the right shows a horizontal cross-section through the middle of the brain. In this image, the cerebral cortex (the convoluted area) and the white matter can be seen. Millions of myelinated fibers connect the white matter and the cerebral cortex. The total length of the myelin fibers in the brain of a 20-year-old male is about 176,000 kilometers. The total length of myelin fibers in the female brain at the same age is about 149,000 kilometers.[5]  At the top of the brain, the convoluted cerebral cortex is divided into two hemispheres, known as the cerebral hemispheres. This region is the largest part of the brain.[6] The part of the stem that lies below the cerebral hemispheres and joins them is called the brainstem. At the back of the brain, below the cerebral cortex, the area behind the brainstem is known as the cerebellum. This region is distinguished from other parts of the brain by its horizontal groove-like structure. The cerebellum, also found in other mammalian species, is one of the smallest parts of the brain. Also, as a general rule, the smaller an organism's cerebellum, the less convoluted its cerebral cortex is. An example of this is that the cerebral cortex of rat and hamster is smooth without folds. Whales and dolphins, the largest mammals, have more folds in the cerebral cortex than humans. A distinctive feature of the human brain is the enormous cerebral cortex. Being so large in humans, it appears to completely cover the rest of the brain. The human cerebellum is larger than that of other mammals. Human cerebral cortex plays a major role not only in size but also in brain function. For example, a mouse can walk, eat, and sense external changes even after its cerebral cortex has been surgically removed. But a person whose cerebral cortex is damaged will go into a permanent coma.   The cerebral cortex is divided into roughly equal right-left hemispheres. Anatomists divide each hemisphere into four lobes. They are frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe. It is noteworthy that the names of these sections are arranged according to the names of the cranial bones adjacent to the sections.  The cerebral cortex is shaped like a broad sheet of neural tissue folded into several folds and compressed into a narrow skull. The area of ​​the neuron in each cerebral hemisphere when unfolded is about 1.3 square feet.[7] Anatomists refer to the groove formed by these folds as a sulcus, and the smooth area between each groove as a gyrus. Although the folds of all humans generally have approximately the same shape, the differences are markedly distinct with some variation in shape and location of values. However, some large folds can be found in all mandarins.  Different regions of the cerebral cortex have the ability to learn and govern different cognitive abilities (eg, seeing, hearing, feeling). This can be confirmed in various ways: damage to a specific part of the brain, affecting only a specific sense, special design of the magnetic resonance imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a specific sense and the brain that governs it. Identifying the specific region and examining the fibrous structure of the cerebral cortex is significant. According to anatomists, the cerebral cortex can be divided into about 6 layers with the aid of a microscope. However, it is not possible to separate these layers in all parts of the brain. Many anatomists have diagrammed these layers in the cortex. Brodmann, who is known as the first among them, classified the different parts of the brain into 52 sections. (Later anatomists divided it into many more subdivisions). Topography  motor cortex The primary motor cortex is a motor cortex located in the anterior margin of the central sulcus as shown in Fig. The motor cortex is the part of the body that sends commands to the voluntary muscles of the body. The diagram on the right shows that the primary motor cortex, one of the motor cortexes of the brain, organizes the movement control areas of the body parts sequentially. In other words, in the order in which the parts of the body are located, first the feet, followed by the legs, thighs, and abdomen, in the same order, their control areas are set up in the brain. Doctors have also found that when an area of ​​the cortex is electrically stimulated, the muscles of the organ that the area controls tighten. However, each organ is controlled by varying degrees of cortical neuron. For example, the cortical afferents that control organs in the human head are three times larger than the cortical afferents that control the spine. The more dense (larger) the cortical nerve fibers that control an organ, the greater the motor control and sensory perception of that organ. Because of this, the human lips, tongue, fingers, and facial muscles are small but perform many fine functions (eg, tongue, lips - speaking) and the amount of cortical nerve fibers representing them is large. Visual cortex The cortical neural systems for human vision are similar to those of the retina at the back of the eye. Each retinal nerve cell, which transforms the light reaching the human eye into vision, is represented by certain cortical neurons in this area. In particular, neurons in the center of the retina (with greater emphasis on objects in the center of vision) are allocated more visual cortical neurons than neurons at the periphery of the retina. The visual cortex in the cerebral cortex contains hundreds of different retinotopic maps to examine the appearance of a scene falling on the retina from different angles. Through these, an appearance is examined from multiple angles simultaneously and a final decision is made. The primary visual cortex (section 17 of Brodmann's classification) receives nerve impulses from the eye directly via the thalamus. This region is able to easily extract the main characteristics (visual features) from the received images. The forebrain represents the two large chambers of the spherical, gray matter in the forebrain. These transmit impulses from the senses to the cerebral cortex. The visual cortex detects the color, motion, speed, and shape of objects in the scene after the primary visual cortex. Auditory cortex The auditory cortex has tonotopic maps arranged in a spatial tonality pattern. The left-brain tone system means that each different tone (sound frequency) heard by humans excites a different area of ​​the auditory cortex. In short, it means spatially tuning the frequency of the tone. The total combination of excitations occurring in different parts of the auditory cortex produces a word. Sounds are distinguished by the frequency they produce (ie, high pitch or low pitch). Like the visual system, the auditory region has more than one tonotopic cortical map. Each draft requires a different approach to sound. Verb Interception  Verbal mapping involves identifying each control area of ​​the brain and the functions of the organ it controls and mapping them to each other. Each hemisphere of the brain controls a part of the body. Also, it is noteworthy that the right brain controls the left side of the body and the left brain controls the right side of the body. In the same way, the motor connections and sensory connections between the brain and the spinal cord, in the middle of the brainstem, shift from right to left and from left to right.

"Vocabulary (phonetic) refers to specialized vocabulary that can be used in a particular field of knowledge. An artefact within each field may have one or more referent objects. These need not correspond to objects in the general case. As a particular field is studied for a significant period of time, such specialized words found in that field develop to convey a deeper meaning. The value of such specialized vocabulary depends on the fact that each word contains a certain amount of information. Vocabulary is, along with semantics, a means of gaining depth and precision in meaning. Thus, terminologies are useful for experts in a field to communicate concisely and accurately among themselves. General terms and terminology differences Terms based on definitions have many different characteristics from general terms. The following characteristics of specific terms[1] distinguish them from general terms. Inapplicability in general case For use by a specialized team only Being a special subject The subject matter is also decided by the departmental staff Expressing the deep meaning while signifying the subtle. General characteristics However, in use there are commonalities between the two. Words are used within the grammatical limits of the language, even if they are not in the general case of the language. Thus, it can be seen that terms with general terms for a particular language have the following general characteristics.[2] Using the same codes Same pronunciation Same morphological structure conforming to the same syntax rules Using the same phrase types. Categories Terminology is often incomprehensible to the general public and people from other fields as it differs from the common case. However, this is not to say that all terms are not in the common case. Many words that are considered to be technical terms are also found to be intelligible in the general case. On this basis, the words used as terminology can be grouped into three categories. Those in the general case (words such as area, area, triangle etc.) Purely sectoral (terms such as potassium sulphate, Perungan Age, Eriyam, Primenakadu etc. fall into this category) Intermediate (computer, ozone layer, desertification are some terms that are widely understood nowadays) Approaches to Terminology Most approaches have generally held that to the extent that specialized dialects, including vocabulary, are part of language, it is a medium for emotional expression and communication. Differences between approaches were observed depending on the objectives and operational needs of the beneficiaries. Initially three different approaches were considered. These are 1) linguistic approach, 2) translational approach, and 3) planning approach.[3] Three groups can be considered important as far as the linguistic approach is concerned. One group based their approach on Eugene Wooster's ""General Terminological Theory"". They took the concepts as primary and the names for them as terminology. The group also emphasized international standardization of terminology. Another group considered the special dialect, which includes vocabulary, as a style of the general dialect, and took vocabulary as units of functional and professional style of language. A third group framed their approach to standardizing concepts and terminology against the backdrop of a multilingual context.[4] The translation approach is based on providing facilities for translations. This approach emphasizes the creation of multilingual terminologies and the creation of databases for them.[5] In regions with multilingual communities, this approach is most useful for government administration needs. The terminology database ensures that all translators use official terminology. Vocabulary standardization  Terminology has a long history. However, there was no uniformity in terminology during those times. As science, technology and new fields of knowledge developed rapidly, the importance of standardization of terminology was realized for mass communication and dissemination of knowledge. In the early 20th century, Eugen Wüster, who is from Austria and is considered the father of etymology, was involved in related studies. In 1931, his book International Standardization of Technical Vocabulary, a German language book, led to the formation of an International Technical Committee for Standardization of Technical Vocabulary under the International Organization for Standardization. Between 1967 and 1973, the group published seven basic papers on the standardization of terminology. Wooster, along with other researchers, has researched and written several books, including Fundamentals of General Theory of Terminology and International Terminology. Through these, he expressed many ideas related to methods of lexicography, clarification of terminology, documentation, transliteration etc. Notes  Subsidiaries Shanmugam, Sec.

Life history Born in Thorapalli village near Hosur in Krutinagiri District (Old Salem District). His father was Chakraborty Venkatarya and mother Singaramma.[3] Rajaji's schooling was in Osur and higher education in Bangalore. College education was spent at Bengaluru Central College and Madras Provincial College. In 1898 Chittur married Alarmelu Mangammal, daughter of Thirumalai Sambangi Iyengar. Three boys and two girls were born. In 1900, he was running his legal practice well. He later joined politics and was elected a member of the Salem Municipality in 1917 and later a city father. Joining the Congress, Rawalt was involved in the Anti-Law Movement, Non-Cooperation Movement, Vaikam Satyagraha etc. In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi went to jail by conducting a salt satyagraha at Vedaranyam in connection with the Dandi Yatra.

"India has 29 states and 7 union territories including the National Capital Territory of Delhi. All states and union territories have popularly elected governments in Pondicherry and the Delhi Capital Territory. Other Union Territories are directly governed by the President, with Governors appointed by the Central Government. In 1956, linguistic states were created under the States Reorganization Act. After that, some new states were formed in the northern parts of India. States and Union Territories are divided into small administrative units called districts. States and Union Territories  Andhra Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh Assam Bihar Chhattisgarh Goa Gujarat Ariana Himachal Pradesh Jammu and Kashmir Jharkhand Karnataka Kerala Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Manipur Meghalaya Mizoram Nagaland Orissa Punjab Rajasthan Sikkim Tamil Nadu Telangana Tripura Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand West Bengal Union Territories called Union Territories:  Andaman and Nicobar Islands Chandigarh Dadra and Nagar Haveli Daman, Theu Lakshadweep Delhi Puducherry  States and their capitals   Formation of Indian States British India comprised of present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan consisted of two sub-political units. The provinces were directly governed by British officers of the rank of Governor or Special Commissioner, appointed by the Viceroy. The princely states were ruled by local hereditary rulers who accepted British suzerainty. British India consisted of 15 provinces: Ajmer-Merwara, Assam, Baluchistan, Bengal, Bihar, Bombay, Central Provinces, Berar, Coorg, Delhi, Madras, North-West Frontier, Orissa, Punjab, Sind, and United Provinces. In British India, there were many princely states of varying sizes. These ranged from Hyderabad, with a population of over a crore, to much smaller princely states. Apart from these, two other European countries occupied some territories in India. Portuguese India included the coastal territories of Goa, Taman and Diu, Tatra and Nagar Haveli, and French India included the five territories of Sundernagar, Enam, Pondicherry, Karaikal and Maghe. During the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, these provinces and princely states were divided between the two countries. Only Punjab and Bengal were divided on religious lines. Although Hyderabad's Islamic ruler tried to remain independent, the Indian army intervened and annexed it to India. Both countries claim Jammu and Kashmir. Majority of the people were Muslims. The Hindu ruler of Jammu and Kashmir annexed the country to India. In 1950, the Constitution of India came into force and various states were formed. Formerly provinces, Category A states were governed by a governor and an elected assembly. The nine states included in this category are: Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Bombay, Madhya Pradesh (formerly Central Provinces and Berar), Madras, Orissa, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh (formerly United Provinces). There was a demand among the people to separate the Telugu speaking areas from the Chennai province and create a separate state of Andhra Pradesh. As part of this request Poti Siriramalu was resurrected after fasting for 58 days. Andhra Pradesh was created as a separate state on October 1, 1953 to put an end to the riots that followed. In the same year, the State Reorganization Commission was constituted with Basal Ali as Chairman and Panicker, Kunzuru as members. This commission advised to organize the states on the basis of language. On the recommendations of this committee, the States Reform Act was passed in 1956. India was divided into 14 states. Gujarat was separated from Maharashtra (1960) on the same basis. In later years many more states were formed. Nagaland in 1963, Ariana in 1966, Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur in 1972, Sikkim in 1975, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Goa in 1987. In 2000, three more states namely Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand were formed. The state of Telangana was created from Andhra Pradesh in 2014 and is the 29th state of India.

"Chemical element (Chemical element: Sri Lankan case: Molekam) refers to atoms of the same type that have the same number of protons in their nucleus [1]. 118 elements have been identified so far. Of these, 94 elements are naturally occurring and the remaining 24 are synthetically produced. 80 elements have at least one isotope. 38 Nuclei of elements are radioactive nuclei. Some examples of elements are hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, sulfur, phosphorus, gold, mercury, and uranium. Oxygen is considered to be the most ubiquitous element on Earth and iron is the most abundant element by mass. The universe and everything in it is made of matter. All these products are made of chemicals. Astronomical results suggest that ordinary matter that we can see with the naked eye makes up only 15% of the matter in the universe. The rest is called dark matter. Its components are not yet known. But; It is definitely said that it is not made of chemical elements.  Eitherson and Ilium are the two lightest elements that formed when the universe was formed in the Big Bang. These are the most common elements found in the universe. The next three elements, lithium, beryllium, and boron, are mostly formed by nuclear fusion reactions of cosmic rays. Hence they are rarer than heavy metals. Elements with 6 to 26 protons are formed through nuclear fusion that occurs within galaxies. This is reflected in the presence of elements such as oxygen, silicon and iron in large quantities. Elements with more than 26 protons originate in superluminous galaxies through superluminous interstellar explosions. It is said that when these galaxies exploded, these elements were scattered in the sky and went into them to form the planets [2]. The word element means having a certain number of protons. It does not care whether it is ionochemically bonded. And the term element also means that a pure chemical substance is composed of a single element. Example Aidarasan [1].The understanding that element is an elementary object is also stated. English chemistry texts do not recognize this subject. But some languages ​​recognize it. A simple element can have many different forms. Different elements combine chemically to form compounds. Thus the atoms of the combining elements are held together by chemical bonds. A relatively small number of elements are available alone as pure minerals. Examples are copper, silver carbon. Inert gases and rare elements are present in various forms along with other chemicals. All 32 elements that are said to occur singly in nature are also found in compounds. Examples of this are elements like oxygen, iron, and nickel. Early human societies discovered natural elements such as carbon, sulphur, copper and gold and began using these elements. Thus new discoveries followed. Later new civilizations learned to purify and extract the elements using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists later identified many elements; Almost all naturally occurring elements were discovered in the 1900s. . Elements are arranged in the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number. Their physical and chemical properties were compiled. Pollutants, half-life, industrial activities etc. were identified. Abundant minerals in the universe The top ten most abundant elements in the universe are listed here.  Properties of elements Hydrogen and Helium are the lightest chemical elements.Its mass is 3:1 compared to other elements.Elements occur naturally, through nuclear decay and cosmic rays.Each element has its atomic number, density, melting and boiling point, ion energy. Components vary.   atomic number An element's atomic number is defined by its number of protons[3]. For example, all carbon atoms have 6 protons in their nucleus. So the atomic number of carbon is 6. But the neutrons are in different numbers; Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the number of electrons, and those electrons determine the electrical conductivity of the element. Electrons are placed in the corresponding orbitals to determine the various chemical properties of the atom. The number of neutrons in a nucleus determines its chemical properties. The number of protons in the nucleus also determines the charge of the atom. And through this the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus of that atom is also determined. Electrons are filled in various orbits called orbitals around the nucleus of an atom. The arrangement of these orbitals accounts for the properties of the element. Elements of an atom such as atomic weight atomic mass atomic number play an important role in the identification and function of elements. Properties There are many different types of classes of material. Properties of elements are usually classified based on the element's color, and chemical properties, melting and boiling points, their density, crystal structure, and appearance. Types of element Actinides, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, halogens, lanthanides, rare metals; Types of elements are metalloids, inert gases, polyatomic metals (nonmetals), interatomic metals, and transition metals. Three levels of element Elements exist in all three states. Most elements remain in the solid state. Some elements exist as gases, but only bromine and mercury are liquids at normal atmospheric pressure. Both cesium and gallium are solid elements. However, it starts melting at 28.4°C (83.2°F) and 29.8°C (85.6°F) respectively.  Names of elements Before formal names were given to the elements, each country was assigned a different name, but later, for international communication and trade purposes, they began to use the ancient and more recently recognized official names. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPA) publishes the official names of the elements. They also name new elements. Usually the names of the elements are based on the names of the discoverers.  Element and its symbol  Symbols of isotopes  Isotopes are different types of atoms of the same element. This means that their nucleus has same number of protons and different number of neutrons. For example carbon has three isotopes. All isotopes of carbon have 6 protons. But they have 6,7,8 neutrons. So their atomic masses also vary as 12, 13, 14 respectively. Thus the isotopes of carbon get the names carbon-12, carbon-13, carbon-14. Abbreviated as 12C, 13C, and 14C. Isotopes are also called isotopes. Equivalents also have corresponding element codes. Isotopes are distinguished by their atomic mass number (the total number of protons and neutrons). For an atomic symbol, write the symbol of the element and then write the atomic number over their head. For example 12c and 235U. However, other symbols such as carbon-12 and uranium-235, or C-12, U-235, can also be used.

"Nagaland is a state located in the northeastern part of India. It shares borders with the Indian states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and neighboring Myanmar. Its state capital is Kohima. Nagaland is divided into eleven administrative districts. There are 16 major ethnic groups living in this state. Ethnically they are Naga ethnic groups belonging to the Indo-Mongoloid ethnic group. Nagaland was made a state on December 1, 1961. The state has a majority of Scheduled Tribes and the population growth rate has decreased to -0.58% in the last decade (2001-2011).[1]The official language of the state is English. History  Antiquity  The ancient history of the Naga people is not clear. Migrant tribes at different periods settled in what is now Northeast India and established their own sovereign hill states and villages. There is no record of whether they came from the northern Mongolian region, southeast Asia, or southwest China. Besides, their origin is from the eastern part of India and from AD. Historical records also show that the present-day Naga people settled before the arrival of Akom in 1228. Even the origin of the word 'Naga' is unclear.[2] A widely accepted but controversial theory is that the name derives from the Burmese word 'naga' or 'naga', meaning people with earrings. Others interpret it as a pierced nose.[3] Both naka and naga are pronounced the same in Burmese.[4] The ancient name of Nagaland is 'Naganachi' or 'Nagansi', derived from the Naga language.[5] Before the advent of European colonialism in South Asia, many wars and persecutions were waged by the Burmese against the northeastern parts of India, such as the Naga tribes and the Meeti people. Invaders came to ""head hunt"" and seek the riches of this tribe. When the British asked the Burmese guides about the people living in the northern Himalayas, they said 'Naga'. It was recorded as 'Naga' and used thereafter. British India The Naga people have been sovereign for generations without any monarchy. But the first time the British entered Nagaland was in 1832 when they tried to find a direct route between Assam and Manipur. All Naga villages opposed them then. The British tried to bring Nagaland under their rule. They couldn't do it that easily. In 1879, the British defeated the Nagas in a village battle near Kochima, now the capital of Nagaland. Later in 1880 Nagaland was brought under British rule through peace negotiations. Due to the British rule, all the Naga people who were separate villages earlier were brought under the single identity of Naga. This led to a strengthening of unity among the Naga people. From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries from America and Europe converted the Naga tribes of British India,[6] Nagaland and neighboring states from their Animist religion to Christianity.[7] 20th century  In 1944, the Indian National Army led by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose invaded India through Burma with the help of the Japanese army. It tried to liberate India through Kohima. People were evacuated. Part of Kohima was liberated by the British in 1944 by British Indian soldiers. The Indian National Army lost half its men, many to starvation, and was forced to withdraw through Burma.[8][9] Naga movement In 1929, the Naga Club (which later became the Naga National Council) submitted a demand by the Naga people to the Simon Commission. In it they request that they be exempted from the reforms and new taxes proposed in British India, and if British India wants to give them freedom, they kindly request that they leave Nagaland as it was in the olden days without leaving them under anyone. [10][11] During the period from 1929 to 1935, the Naga people's understanding of sovereignty was 'self-rule' based on the traditional territorial definition. During the period from 1935 to 1945, the Nagas demanded autonomy only in Assam. On 1 August 1946, Nehru, the leader of the Indian National Congress, asked the Naga people to join the Indian Union. He said that local autonomy rights and security would be given to a wider area of ​​administration. After 1946, the Nagas insisted on a separate nation of their own and their full right to live independently. Before India's independence on July 19, 1947, representatives of the Naga National Council met Gandhi in Delhi. Gandhi had a long discussion with them and assured them that “Nagaland has every right to remain independent if it does not want to join the Indian Union”. Accordingly, Nagaland declared its independence on 14 August 1947. This was opposed by the Union Government of India. A petition was submitted to the President of India to hold a plebiscite to convey the consensus of the Naga people to India. As it was not taken into consideration, they conducted a public poll on 16th May 1951, consolidated the ballot papers and sent them to the President of the Republic of India in a book worth 80 pounds. When India's first general election was held in 1952, the people of Nagaland completely boycotted it.[12] After the independence of India in 1947, Naland was made a part of Assam province. This gave rise to nationalist activities among a section of the Nagas. The movement led to a series of violent incidents that damaged government and civilian infrastructure, attacked government officials and civilians. Following this, the Union Government of India sent the Indian Army in 1955. In 1957 an agreement was reached between the Naga chiefs and the Government of India whereby it was decided to create a separate region with the Naga Hills. Dissatisfied with this, the tribes and states again resorted to violent attacks. Tribals also increased attacks on the military and government institutions, including banks. In 1958, the Government of India enacted the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in Nagaland. The army was concentrated there at a ratio of one Iranian to three. Later many were killed by paramilitary forces. After discussions between Prime Minister Nehru and Naga People's Conference leaders in July 1960, the 16-point agreement was formed. Accordingly, the Government of India recognized Nagaland as a fully fledged state within the Union of India.[13] According to the second aspect of this agreement, Nagaland was brought under the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. It also includes features like income tax exemption. This 16-point agreement was incorporated into the Constitution of India as Article 371A.[14]   Accordingly, under the Nagaland Interim Rules of 1961,[15] the territory was placed under an interim body consisting of 45 members elected by the tribals on the basis of tribalism, customs and usage of the respective tribes. As a result, the state of Nagaland came into existence in 1962 with the Nagaland State Act.[16] On 30 November 1963 the interim system was dissolved and the state of Nagaland was formally formed on 1 December 1963 with Kohima declared as the capital of the state. After the January 1964 elections, the first popularly elected Nagaland Legislative Assembly was constituted on 11 January 1964.[17][18] This was followed by insurgent activities and attacks. Negotiations were announced and negotiations continued, but this did not stop the violence. In 1973, the Government of India arbitrarily brought Nagaland under the Ministry of Home Affairs, which was under the Ministry of External Affairs. A resolution was passed in the Nagaland Assembly to bring it back under the Ministry of External Affairs. In March 1975, President's rule was introduced in the state by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In November 1975, the leaders of most of the rebel groups laid down their arms and agreed to accept the Constitution of India, but a small group did not accept this and continued their insurgent activities.[19] Districts  The state is divided into eleven districts for administrative convenience. They are; Dimapur Kibair Kochima Longling Mokokchung Mon Beren Pack Tuwensang Voca Sunephoto Politics   The Nagaland Assembly has 60 assembly constituencies. As in other states, the Chief Minister is the head of state. The entire state falls under Nagaland Lok Sabha constituency.[20] Demography According to the 2011 Indian Census, Nagaland has an area of ​​16,579 square kilometers and a total population of 1,978,502. 71.14% people live in rural areas and 28.86% people live in urban areas. In the last decade (2001-2011) the population growth rate has decreased to -0.58%. The population consists of 1,024,649 males and 953,853 females. The sex ratio is 931 females per 1,000 males. With an area of ​​16,579 square kilometers, the state has a population density of 119 per square kilometer. The average literacy rate of this state is 79.55 %, male literacy is 82.75 % and female literacy is 76.11 %. The number of children under the age of six is ​​291,071. [21] Nagas constitute the majority population in the state. time In this state, the population of Hindus is 173,054 (8.75 %), the population of Muslims is 48,963 (2.47 %), the population of Christians is 1,739,651 (87.93 %), the population of Buddhists is 6,759 (0.34 %), and the population of Sikhs is 1,890. (0.10 %), the population of other religions is 3,214 (0.16 %) and the population of no religion is 2,316 (0.12 %). languages English is the official language of the state, along with Naga, the tribal language, and regional languages. Transportation  This state has the lowest continuous road in the length of 7.98 miles (Error in convert: Unit name ""km"" is not known (help)). The state has 15,000 km of national and state highways. Hornbill Festival  The Hornbill Festival, a tribal festival of Nagaland, is world famous. Development plans Nagaland is a ten-fifteen hour drive from the capital Delhi.[22] Being an area rich in natural resources but not fully connected by transport, there is a situation where even people from the rest of India do not prioritize this region for tourism. In the future, the Ishan Udai Scholarship Program will be implemented for North East Indian students, and the Ishan Vikas Program will be implemented to allow and arrange annual visits to educational institutions such as IITs in other parts of India. Arrangements are also being made to attract outsourcing jobs.[23][24] See also this Naga people Quotations  External links    Category:States and Territories of India ",Which is the capital of Nagaland state?,Kohima,232
"James Watt (January 19, 1736 – August 25, 1819) was a Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer. His improvements to the steam engine laid the foundation for the Industrial Revolution in Britain and other parts of the world. James Watt was born on 19th January 1736 in the port town of Greenock on the Fifth Clyde. His father was a ship builder, ship owner and contractor. James Watt's mother, Agnes Muirhead, came from a respectable family. He was well educated. Watt didn't go to school properly. But mostly he was taught by his mother at home. He was very interested in learning mathematics. His mother passed away when he was 18 years old. His father's health was also affected. Watt went to London to learn instrument making and returned to Scotland after Orlando. There he intended to start his own tool making business. Early experiments with steam In 1759, Watt's friend John Robson suggested that we should focus on using steam as a source of motive power.[2] The Newcomen steam engine has been in use for nearly 50 years to pump water out of mines without any change in design. Although he had never seen a working steam engine, Watt began experimenting with steam. He tried to build a model; It failed to work satisfactorily, but he continued his experiments and began to read everything about the steam engine. Watt began to realize the importance of internal heat. And the discovery of the way in which the heat energy absorbed by constant heat transfer could be used to power the steam engine was new to Watt and had been discovered by Watt's friend Joseph Black a few years earlier. In the field of thermal energy, steam engine propulsion was still in its infancy. And the next one hundred (100) years continued without regularization. In 1763, Watt was asked to repair a model of a Newcome machine owned by the university.[2] Even after repair the engine barely worked. After much experimentation, Watt demonstrated that one-third of the thermal energy produced by the steam in each cycle was used to heat the cylinder of the engine.[3] This heat energy is wasted because cold water is injected to cool the steam to reduce the pressure inside the cylinder at each cycle. Because of this repeated heating and cooling of the cylinder each cycle, the engine wasted more heat energy without converting efficiency into more kinetic energy. Watt's important discovery occurred in May 1765,[4] as he cooled the heat of steam in a separate chamber outside the piston. This method of operation was able to maintain a uniform temperature inside the engine cylinder because the cylinder was surrounded by a steam jacket.[3] Thus some small amount of energy is absorbed in each cycle and a large amount of kinetic energy is available to do useful work. In the same year, Watt developed a working model.   Despite a potentially workable design, there were considerable difficulties in constructing a full-scale machine. This required a lot of capital, some of which came from black money. Watt received considerable support from John Roebuck. John Ballk was the founder of the nearby famous Carron ironworks. Watt arranged an alliance with him. Roebuck was living at Kinnell House in Bonnes, when Watt filmed his steam engine in a cottage near Roebuck's house. The cage and wat of that hut still stands as a witness of grand schemes. [5] The first steam engine  In 1776, the first steam engines were installed and put to work in trading companies. These first machines were used to provide pumping power to pipelines, which only produced a single transmission motion to move the pipeline rods along the bottom of the shafts. The design was commercially successful, and over the next five years Watt installed more machinery, particularly for pumping water out of mines in Cornwall. These early engines were not produced by Boulton and Watt, but from others based on drawings drawn by Watt, with Watt serving only as a consulting engineer. The start of the machinery and its frequency was first superintended by Watt, and men of the firm were then employed to do the work. Originally these were large machines. For example, a cylinder was 50 inches in diameter and 24 feet tall. A separate building was required to house this machine. Boulton and Watt received as their annual income a third of the amount of coal saved by the new machine as money for their work. Honors Watt was honored during his lifetime. In 1784 he was honored as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1787 was elected a Fellow of the Batavian Society for Methodology, Rotterdam. In 1789 he was elected a member of the Supreme Council of the Smithsonian Society of Civil Engineers. [6] In 1806, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws by the University of Glasgow. The French Academy elected him a recognized member and in 1814 he was appointed a foreign associate. [7] Watt (International System of Units (or ""SI"")) Formally, the watt was named after James Watt for his contribution to the development of the steam engine, and was adopted by the Second Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1889. , and the unit watt was incorporated into the International System of Power (Physics) (or ""SI"") in 1960. On 29 May 2009 the Bank of England announced that images of Poulton and Watt would be printed on its new £50 pound sterling banknote. This is the first time in the Bank of England's banknote history that two figures have been printed. [8] It was announced in September 2011 that the banknote would be circulated on 2 November. [9] memorials  Watt's body was buried in the grounds of St Mary's Church, Handsworth, Birmingham. Due to the later expansion of the church building over Watt's grave, his grave is now believed to be buried beneath the church.[10] Watt spent most of his retirement in a workshop known as the Carrot Room. This room was left unused and neglected until 1853 after Watt's death. It was then first viewed by Watt biographer J. P. Muirhead.[11] After that, the room was visited occasionally but remained untouched like a holy shrine. And while there was a proposal to convert Watt's room into a patent office, no action was taken. When Watt's room was demolished in 1924, the room and all its contents were presented to the Science Museum, where a model of it was recreated. It was on display for visitors for several years, but while the gallery was closed the walls of the workshop—completely defaced and intact—were preserved and put on public display in March 2011 as part of a new permanent Science Museum exhibit titled ""James Watt and Our World"".[12] Image collage  Watt's steam trap stored at Loughborough University Where James Watt used to work  Quotations   Category:1736 Births Category:Engineers Category:1819 Deaths ",When was mechanical engineer James Watt born?,19th January 1736,271
"Pakistan (Pakistan, pakistan, ( or ; ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (), is a country on the Asian continent. Pakistan is one of the most densely populated countries. Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan. Karachi is the main port and industrial city. Lahore, near the Indian border, is another important city. city. Pakistan is the sixth most populous country with a population of 180 million. With an area of ​​796,095 km2 ( ), this country is the 36th largest country on this basis. To the south is the Arabian Sea and Oman has a remote coastline at Guda; It is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and the People's Republic of China to the northeast. In the north, Afghanistan is separated from Tajikistan by the narrow Wagan Range. It also shares its maritime border with Oman. Many ancient civilizations flourished in what is now Pakistan. Neolithic Megargarh and Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization are notable. Kings of various religions and cultures such as Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turko-Mongols, Afghans, Sikhs have ruled here. The Indian Mauryan Empire, the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander of Macedonia, the Arabian Umayyad Caliphate, the Mauryan Empire, the Gupta Empire, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Durani Empire, the Maratha Empire, the Sikh Empire and the British Empire have ruled here. Pakistan was formed in 1947 as a country for Muslims due to the liberation struggles in the subcontinent and Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Pakistan Movement, which subjugated the Muslim-majority West and East regions of the subcontinent. Pakistan remained a Dominion until it adopted its own constitution in 1956 and became an Islamic Republic. After the civil war of 1971, East Pakistan seceded and emerged as a new country named Bangladesh. Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic with four states and four federal territories. Pakistan is a multi-faceted country with many languages, ethnicities and similar geography and wildlife. A regional and middle power, Pakistan is the seventh most militarized country in the world and is a nuclear power and nuclear weapons country, a regionally influential country[1][2]; It is the only nuclear-armed country in the Muslim world and the second in South Asia. With a partially industrialized economy and a well-integrated agricultural sector, Pakistan is the world's 26th largest economy and 45th largest by nominal gross national product. It is also one of the fastest growing countries in the world. Intermittent military rule, political instability and Indo-Pakistani wars have played a major role in Pakistan's post-independence history. Overcrowding, extremism, poverty, lack of education and corruption are the main problems of the country. Despite this, it was ranked 16th on the Happy Planet Index in 2012.[3] United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, Next Eleven Economies, Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), Coffee Group, Developing Eight (D8), Cairns Group, Kyoto Protocol, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, United Nations Economic and Social Council, Organization of Islamic Cooperation , a member of SAARC and the European Atomic Energy Agency.[4] Name reason The Urdu word known as Pakistan means (pak + stan) pure land. Pak means pure[5]. History When the British left India in 1947, Pakistan was created to divide India into East and West and India was in between. Negotiations are still ongoing to resolve many of the issues that have arisen. In Pakistan, which was east of India, when there was a revolt against the authority of West Pakistan, India's intervention led to the separation of Bangladesh as a separate country. Geography Close to Pakistan are India, China, Iran and Afghanistan. To the south of Pakistan lies the Arabian Sea. Much of the Indus River, which gives its name to India and Hinduism, now flows through Pakistan. The Khyber Pass and Bolan Pass, which helped Central Asians invade the Indian subcontinent in ancient times, are now under Pakistan's control. People It is the sixth most populous country in the world. It is the second most Muslim-majority country in the world. 96.3% of the population in Pakistan are Muslims. Urdu and English are the official languages. Urdu is widely spoken. Punjabi is the mother tongue of most people. Sindhi language is also widely spoken. Administrative divisions  Pakistan consists of 4 provinces, 1 Centrally Administered Tribal Area and 1 Capital Territory.  Provinces: Balochistan Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP) Punjab Indus Territories:  Capital city of Islamabad Tribal Areas in Central Government  Pakistan Administered Kashmir:  Azad Kashmir Gilgit - Baltistan  Politics There is a lot of military intervention in the government. Many times the military has seized power and dissolved the government. The Constitution was framed in 1973. It was disbanded by the Armed Forces (Army) in 1977, revived in late 1985 with some changes, and disbanded again in 1999. Pervez Musharraf, an army officer of Pakistan, was the recent president. Confusion over the Musharraf-Benazir reconciliation continued and Benazir Bhutto was eventually assassinated. Benazir Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari is currently the President. economy Pakistan is one of the emerging countries. Its economy is largely dependent on the United States and is lagging behind in industrial development as it spends heavily on military buildup. There are also huge foreign debts. Aiding the US invasion of the Taliban in Afghanistan has temporarily sidelined these problems. Pakistan has foreign affairs problems as it is one of the routes through which drugs such as opium are smuggled into the West.

"Paddy or rice (sound) (rice) is a plant belonging to the grass family. It originated in Southeast Asia. It can grow in wetlands. Rice is an annual plant that grows for an average of five months. The seed coat of this crop known as husk is removed and used as food. The seed thus decoated is called rice. But rice does not have the ability to germinate. It is the most cultivated grain after rice, corn and wheat. History Asian rice (Oryza sativa) and African rice (Oryza glaberimma) were cultivated for the first time in the world. Rice cultivation in Asia is thought to have started simultaneously in many countries before 4500 BC. The wild rice species Oryza rufipogan is the common ancestor of the above two types of rice species. Asian rice cultivars are thought to have originated in the foothills of the Himalayas. In India, Oryza sativa var. indica and in China Oryza sativa var. japonica also appeared.  In India, there are many songs about paddy and rice sung by Auvaiyar and other legendary poets. In paddy growing areas, festivals are also celebrated around the time of paddy planting and harvesting. There are also some Sanskrit references to paddy. In China, the word for both agriculture and rice is the same (XXX). Rice has been cultivated in Africa since about 1500 BC. 1500 – 800 BC, it was cultivated in the Niger Delta and then spread to Senegal. However, its cultivation did not spread further. Asian rice species were cultivated by the Arabs introduced in the 7th – 11th centuries AD. One theory is that rice was introduced to Japan from China. But there is also some evidence that the Japanese used to harvest the long-stemmed, water-growing rice crop by boat. Dryland (rainfed) rice cultivation was introduced in Japan around 1000 BC. Later, the modern irrigation system was introduced during the Yayoi period around 300 BC. Asiatic rice was cultivated in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions around 800 BC. The Moors introduced rice to Spain. By the late 15th century rice had spread to Italy, France and later to all continents. In 1694, rice was introduced from Madagascar to South Carolina, USA. The captain of the storm-hit ship arrived at the port of Charleston and gave a bundle of rice as a gift to the farmers there. They started cultivating it. Rice was introduced to South America by the Spanish in the 18th century.  The states of South Carolina and Georgia in the former United States were very profitable growing rice with black slaves brought from West Africa. As these slaves had prior knowledge of paddy cultivation, they were bought at a high price. The landlords learned from the slaves techniques such as bed-making and water storage. Originally in America, paddy was threshed by hand (with a wooden pestle) and then threshed into baskets to separate the rice. These techniques were also introduced by African slaves. Later in 1787, the water-powered rice threshing machine was introduced and rice cultivation became profitable. In the 20th century, rice cultivation declined due to the lack of slaves after the American Civil War. In Sangha songs Sangam literature contains the following references to paddy: The paddy grown in Nansei land is called Vennel [1]. The paddy grown as a field crop in Bunsei land is known as ivavan vennel [2]. Until recently, it was grown in the Punakat of Pachamalai. Ancient storage system and granaries  Large earthen pots, structures made of wooden planks called paddayam or kudir, and granaries made of bricks existed in ancient times for safe storage of harvested paddy.[3] 600 year old rice pans are located in many Hindu temples. Thiruvarangam, Thiruanaikka, Thiruvarangam Koil (near Thirukoilur), Alagharkoil, Thanjavur, Papanasam, Tiruppalatura Temples have such rice pans.[3] Traditional rice varieties More than 200,000 varieties of rice are known to have existed in India.[4] Tamilnadu traditional rice varieties Waden Samba Full speed Kaler Samba Dwarf Navarre Pit blasted Car Annamajaki Licorice Champa Samba of the groom black eye Stone Samba with Garuda. Panangattu Gudawaza Cumin samba Aroma cumin samba Vishnu Pogam[5] Kaiwari Samba Sixtieth short Parker wild yam Coconut Flower Champa Khichdi Samba Ghee Kichi Efforts to preserve traditional rice varieties Our Paddy Protection Organization is committed to the preservation of traditional rice varieties. A paddy festival is held every year in Adirengam village near Thirutharapoondi. It is known that traditional rice varieties have been distributed to 27 thousand farmers across Tamil Nadu.[6] The 'Akshay Krushi Kendra' (Agricultural Centre) at Ulundurpet, Srisaratha Ashram collects 150 varieties of traditional rice varieties and provides traditional seed rice to women farmers and preserves traditional rice seeds.[7][8][9][10] Srinivasamurthy, a graduate farmer from Karnataka, has revived 200 traditional rice varieties with the help of organic farming.[11] Natwar Sarangi, a retired school headmaster of Narisu village, Cuttack district, Odisha, has rescued and preserved 360 traditional rice varieties.[12] Nutrition  Production World rice production rose steadily from 20 million tons in 1960 to 60 million tons in 2004. Rice production averages 68% of paddy production. In 2004, China (31%), India (20%) and Indonesia (9%) led the world rice production. Very little (6% of production) of rice is exported globally. Thailand (26%), Vietnam (15%), USA (11%) are the leading countries in exports. Countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brazil and India import rice in large quantities. In Tamil Nadu, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts produce rice in large quantities.   Paddy Cultivation  Rice, the daily staple of most people in the world, comes from the rice plant. Rice is the most consumed grain in the world. Next to maize and wheat, millet is the most cultivated crop in the world. Rice is cultivated mostly in areas with cheap labor and high rainfall or other water resources. A large amount of human labor and water are required to grow rice. However, rice is also cultivated in hilly areas. Although originating in Asia, it is cultivated throughout the world through commercial rice cultivation. Rice is grown in waterlogged beds. In a few countries, fish are grown along with paddy due to water retention of about 15 cm. Because rice paddies are grown in waterlogged areas, there are naturally fewer weeds. Soil, climate Sowing, planting     Depending on the source of water, rice is cultivated in either 'dryland system' or 'irrigation system'. In the dryland system, seeds are sown directly in the field and after germination the excess rice seedlings are weeded. In the hydroponic system, rice seeds are sown in a small plot called a nursery and the seedlings are then planted in the cultivated land at regular intervals. As the name of these systems suggests, the hydroponic system requires a lot of water. In hydroponic system also, rice is sown by direct seeding and then according to germination, the seedlings from the more germinated areas are planted in the less germinated areas. Setting up a nursery Nursery plays an important role in irrigated rice cultivation. Generally, per acre of land, one cent (ie, 10% of the planted area) of nursery stock is required. The nursery is prepared a month before planting. The nursery soil is plowed and watered until it becomes a fine powder without clods. Some farmers water the land a few days before plowing. It causes weed seeds to germinate. Later, during tillage, weed management is reduced as the weeds are buried in the soil. About 200 kg of cow dung manure per cent seedling is plowed into the wet land. Later, drainage ditches are laid on the edges and the land is leveled so that it is slightly hilly but flat in the middle. At the bottom, 5-10 kg of fertilizer (nitrogen), 2 kg of bio-nutrient (phosphorus), 5 kg of magnesium (potassium), 3-4 kg of zinc sulphate are applied. Then, per cent seedling, 10-12 kg of seed is sprinkled evenly. In some countries, the nursery is covered with banana leaves after sowing. At 5 days after sowing, hand weeding or herbicide is sprayed if required. If the seedlings turn yellow without iron, 2% Ferrous Suphate is sprayed. 10 days before the seedling is picked (about 3 weeks after sowing), 1-2 kg of fertilizer is applied as a top dressing. Selection of seed Generally, farmers get seeds from the previous season or from other farmers. Before harvesting, a good portion of the land is selected and other species or weeds are removed. After harvesting, the paddy for seed is threshed by hand (removal of the seed from the plant), dried and threshed in the air. The seeds are then protected by mixing with neem leaves or neem leaves to prevent insect attack. Before sowing, only submersible seeds are selected. Planting field preparation After 3 – 4 weeks of growth in the nursery, the seedlings are plucked and tied. Seedlings are grown in the nursery for twenty days to a maximum of 35 days depending on the growth of the seedling. These are then planted in the planting field with about 5 cm of water. Seedlings are planted at a spacing of 15 X 10 cm in the paddy field and 20 X 10 cm spacing in the paddy field. Every time the water level recedes and the land becomes visible, the water flow is 5 cm. m water is maintained. The required nutrients are separated and applied as compost. Weeds are removed either by using herbicides on the fifth day after planting or by hand on the 15th day. During the planting season in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, planting is done by the local people. Although the recently introduced planting machines have yielded good results in some places, most of the farmers are using agricultural labor for planting. The use of machinery is not yet widespread in Tamil Nadu. In some districts of Tamil Nadu it is customary to start the planting work by leading the clan at the time of planting. Improved rice cultivation The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University have introduced 'Revised Rice Cultivation'. The aim is to reduce rice water requirement, seed size, fertilizer application and weed growth, thereby increasing yield and profitability. In this method, mats are placed very close to the plantation field. As far as the farmers are concerned, rice varieties are classified according to the growing season, ripening period, and the research station where they were discovered. In India and Indonesia, rice varieties are white, black or red depending on the color of the rice. High-yielding rice varieties have been developed for arid regions such as Africa. These are called 'New Rice for Africa' (XXX). It is believed that these will help prevent food shortages in West Africa. rices As far as the consumer is concerned, rice varieties are often classified by the shape and quality of the rice obtained from them. For example, long, fragrant 'Basmati' rice, long, slender 'Patna' rice and short 'Masuri' rice are cultivated in India. In South India, the long slender variety 'Ponni' rice is popular. Hashemi is one of the most popular rice varieties in Iran.[18] Boiled rice In South and East India, after harvesting, paddy is boiled in water, dried and milled into rice. This type of rice is called 'Purwangal' rice. Hard rice varieties are suitable for this. Boiled rice does not lose many nutrients when it is milled; Easily digestible. But, it has a strange smell when it is cooked. Parboiled rice is used in South India to make 'idli' and as a food by the working class. Tamarind The rice obtained by grinding the harvested paddy directly in the mill is called pacharisi. There are people who like to eat this type of rice. Many people do not eat, saying that there is a lag in concentration. Jasmine rice Thai Jasmine rice is a type of long rice. This type of blue rice has less amylopectin and is less sticky when cooked. In China and Japan, short rice varieties with high stickiness are mostly used. Long, slightly sticky rice is used in Chinese restaurants. Fragrant rice Fragrant rice varieties naturally have the same unchanging aroma. Indian varieties like 'Basmati' and 'Patna' are world famous. A rice variety sold in the US under the name 'Dexmati' has created a huge 'patent' controversy. It is a hybrid rice made from American long rice and basmati. Rice genetic research The gene map of the rice plant (en:gene map - a map showing which gene is present in which color and at which gene seat) is known. The film is based on the special Nella, the first fully known higher living organism. Also, two cultivated rice varieties, Indica and Japonica, were selected as examples of grass plants, and the gene sequence in their total genome was completely known and published in April 2002.[19] To increase the vitamin A content in rice, a genetically modified rice variety called 'Golden Rice', which is high in beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, has been developed by scientists and is being studied continuously [20]. In the human body, this beta-carotene can be converted to vitamin A.[21] Controversy continues over whether it provides adequate beta-carotene and whether genetically modified foods are safe.

"A Shiva temple in Thanjavur, also known as Tanjai Pragatheeswarar Temple, Tanjai Periya Koil (""Big temple"") or Tanjai Peruvudayar Temple (""Peruvudayar Temple""). The temple is also a World Heritage Site. It is one of the largest temples in India[1] and one of the most architecturally impressive Indian temples. Rajaraja Cholan I built this temple in the 11th century AD [2]. Started in 1003-1004 and completed in 1010, this temple completed 1000 years in 2010.[3] This temple is the most important tourist destination of Tamil Nadu.[4] It was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1987.[5] The temple, Gangaikonda Choleswarar Temple and Tarasuram Airavadeswarar Temple are all listed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO under the name of Immortal Chola Temples.[6]  The temple is one of the 88 temples under the Thanjavur Palace Devasthanam.[7] Vocabulary Prahadeeswarar Temple is the vernacular form of Thanjav Peruvudayar Temple.[8] The temple is also known as Thanjav Periya Koil[9], Periya Koil, Irajarajeswaran Koil, Irajarajeswaram. Built by Rajaraja Chola I, the temple was initially known as Rajarajeswaram, later as Tanjore Peruvudayar Temple and as Brihadiswaram during the 17th and 18th centuries when it was ruled by the Maratha kings. History  The Chola king Arulmozhivarman, known as Rajaraja Chola I, built the Prahadeeswarar temple in Thanjavur, which is a symbol of the greatness of the Cholas, in order to fulfill the mandate given to him in his dream.[10] Construction work on the temple began in the 19th regnal year of Rajaraja I (1003–1004 AD) and was completed in his 25th regnal year (1009–1010 AD).[6][11] In the plan of the temple, the geometrical rules of symmetry and symmetry are followed.[12] Following this, the temples built for the next two centuries are proof that the Tamils ​​excelled in wealth and art during the Chola period. A new feature of Chola architecture is the multifaceted pillars with square bases.[13] A unique example of South Indian temple architecture, the temple is a testament to the Chola rule and Tamil civilization in South India and is a fine example of the Chola's prowess in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze sculpture.[14] Medieval Cholas AD From 985 to 1070 Chola art flourished and reached its peak. A large number of temples were built during the medieval Chola period. The construction of temples continued throughout the sprawling Chola Empire. Many small temples were also built during this period. Behind the idea of ​​building a large temple Rajaraja was greatly impressed by the Kailayanathar temple built by Rajasimha at Kanchi. Similarly Rajarajan, who wanted to build a temple, built a big temple in Thanjavur. It is also said that the structure of Periyakovil was modeled on the Asaleshwarar Sannidhi in Tiruvarur Thiagarajar Temple. A small brick temple built by Rajarasa at Thanjavur, Thirukkatupalli, Ilangat is the prototype. The name of the deity in Thiruvidaimarudurg temple is Mahalingam. The thought is that the idol is not as good as Rajarajan's name. There is also a story that the idea to build a lingam and a temple in accordance with the name Peruvudayar inspired the construction of this temple. structure  The chief sculptor of this temple is mentioned in the inscriptions of the temple as Kunjara Mallan Rajaraja Rama Perundhachan. The base of the temple is 5 meters (16 ft) high.[15] The single stone Nandi weighs 20 tonnes, is two meters high, six meters long and two and a half meters wide,[16] and is the second largest Nandi in India after the Lebakshi Temple Nandi.[17] The presiding deity Ilingam is 3.7 meters tall. The exterior is 240 m. x 125 m. scale.[16] Dance sculptures depicting the 108 Bharata Natya Mudras are carved into the top of the illuminations.[16] Later, the Amman sanniti was built by the Pandyas in the 13th century and the Subramanian sanniti by the Visayanagara kings, and the Vinayagar sanniti was renovated by the Maratha kings.[16] The temple was also improved by Tanjore Nayaks.[18] Temple structure  The main building is 150 feet long. The colossal Vimana rises 190 feet above the navel, with a pointed tower like the Egyptian pyramids. The height of the Lingaraja temple built at Bhubaneswar at that time was 160 feet. It is noteworthy that Rajarajeswaram surpassed even that. Later constructions of this temple include - Front Porch, Nandi Mandapam, Karuvurth Devar Temple, Amman Temple, Subramaniar Temple. Apart from these, all the other parts of this great temple are of the same period. One cannot help but admire their proud appearance and the simple nature of the integrated scheme. The Axial Mandapams, Vimana, Artha Mandapam, Mahamandapam and Great Nandi are enclosed within a circular wall of appropriate dimensions. There is a tower on the east side of this wall. A long pillared hall leads inwards along the wall. It connects 35 sub-temples. These Utkoils are built in central places in the middle of many gaps in the four directions. There is a second tower on the front side where the gate of the second outer prakaram used to be. design Researchers say that the construction method of the Egyptian pyramids is similar to that of the Tanjore and Gangaikonda Cholapura temples. Both are built with layers of selected stones and corbels. Both are designed so that the radiations of the planets are concentrated at its core. Earthquakes are not affected. The body of the kings preserved in the heap of radiations does not deteriorate. Similarly, the Audai-lingams installed in Chola temples continue to excel as temples of power and prestige. Airplane  The main plane is of the ideal type; So it's great. This is also called Matakoil in Tamil. The first example of this type is Dakshinameru-Koranganathar. It stands on a square foundation 99 feet on a side. Bed area is elongated. It is divided into five parts. The middle part is larger than the other parts. From the floor below the ground level to the peak, the canopy and the roof alternate. Pillars embedded in the wall adorn the plinth. On a plinth with a kapotam pressed with a yali figure, an upapeetha is erected on a smaller area of ​​63 feet square. Upanam with inscriptions stands as the Padma floor to receive Kumudham in a gigantic semi-circular shape with Padma floors above and below. The Kumudham is octagonally cut on the rim, while the eastern corner turns diagonally. The continent and Kapodam are shown close up. At the same height as Kumudham is found the line plane. A row of lions, on which a lion-chaser replaces the lions at the corners, and figures of captors, warriors, gaping horses and their riders. Raised to a height of 50 feet, the steep walls of the chamber follow the floor plan, and a colossal arched buttress divides the walls into two storeys. The intervening stone Tanjore Prahadeeswarar Temple was under construction. Alagi, an old lady of the Atyar clan, wanted to give charity to Shiva. The poor old lady used to give curd and buttermilk to the temple builders every day to quench their thirst until the temple was completed. Knowing this, King Arulmozhivarman (Rajarajacholan) engraves the name Alagaki on a stone weighing 80 tons so that everyone knows the Shiva Thonta of the Atyar clan matriarch and placed it on the top of the Rajagopuram. That stone is called Ichik stone. The shadow of that stone falls on Lord Prahadeeswarar. Nandi Mandapam The large Nandi in the Thanjavur temple is made of a single stone. Its height is 14 m, length 7 m, width 3 m. The Nandi Mandapam is said to have been built during the Nayak period. South of the Nandi Mandapam in the Thiruchuttu House facing north is Nandye Rajarajan who built it opposite to Peruvudaiyar. Later the Nayaks installed a large Nandi parallel to the Shiva Lingam. Nandi Keralantagan, which was originally erected, was moved to the area between the Rajarajan gates and later to Thiruchuttu House.[19] shrines Apart from the important temple enshrined in Shivalingam and its mandapams, the temples of Chandikeshwara, Amman, Nataraja, Varakhi, Subramaniyar, Ganapati and Karuvurth Devar are situated within this complex. Peruvudayar Sannidhi - Lord Shiva, known as Peruvudayar, is in the form of Linga. Rajaraja Cholan worshiped this deity as Rajarajeeswaramudayar. This trio does not have a pedestal. Periyanayaki Amman Sannidhi - The goddess of this temple is Periyanayake. It is a Pandya period construction. Karuur Siddhar Sannidhi - There is a separate sannidi dedicated to Karuur Siddhar in this temple. Varagi Amman Sannidhi – It is believed to be a Chola period construction. It is surprising that this Thiruvuru has only two arms unlike anywhere else. inscriptions Inscriptions in many places of this temple are said to explain the personal devotion of Rajarajan to this temple. It seems that not only him, but also the participation of the royal family, government officials, soldiers and the general public in the maintenance and protection of the temple. The financial requirements were met through the lands granted by the king, the revenue from the villages, and in other ways. The first inscription of the temple is proof of this. ""What we have given, what our brother has given, what our girls have given, and what the giver has given, please cut in this stone..."" Documenting not only his contribution but also the contribution of everyone else is dramatic. Here the king gives second in importance to Akan -- his elder sister Kundavai Devi. This is the best he does to the one who nurtured him and gave him his dreams. Next, the gifts given by his graduate Thandi Shakti Vidangi and his wife are listed under the word women, and the gifts given by everyone else under the word giver. It seems that priests, sculptors, Devara Odhuvars, Musicians, Dancers and other servants were appointed as required to perform the daily rituals properly in the temple. Epigraphical evidence shows that 50 oduars and 400 dance matars were present in the temple. Festivals  Brahmotsavam - Rajarajacholan birthday party Annabhishekam Tiruvadhirai Adipuram Karthikai presentation Shivratri Chariot The specialty of Tanjore Great Temple The height of the temple's flight is 216 feet (66 m).[20] At a time when temples were built with only two or three storeys, Rajarajan built a stone temple with 15 storeys and a height of about 60 m in the Cauvery plains where no stones were available. Such a huge temple was completed in about 7 years The Shivalinga in the sanctum sanctorum is the largest Shivalinga in the world. 6 feet high, 54 feet circumference Audaiyar and 23 half feet high lingam are individually carved out of black stone and joined together. The height and width of the colossal Nandi statue at the entrance of this temple are: 13 feet and 16 feet respectively.[10] Some of the temples in Tamil Nadu in the same structure are Gangaikonda Cholapuram Praghadeeswarar Temple, Tarasuram Airavatheswarar Temple and Tiruphuvanam Kampahareswarar Temple. Completed in 1010, the temple celebrated its 1000th birthday in 2010. One thousand rupee note, postage stamp  1000 note was issued on April 1, 1954 on behalf of the central government to add pride to the Tanjore Great Temple. In it, the dramatic appearance of Prahadeeswarar Temple, known as Tanjore Periya Kovil, is imprinted. Sir Benegal Rama Rao, the 4th Governor of RBI, signed it. Those thousand rupee notes were printed in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Kanpur. The notes were issued in 5 series of numbers. The sequence of notes printed in Mumbai is the English letter A.   In 1995, the central government issued a 2-rupee postage stamp bearing the image of father-in-law Rajaraja Cholan. Millennium Celebration  The 1000th anniversary celebration of Tanjore Great Temple was held in Tanjore for 2 days on 25th September and 26th September 2010. Central Minister b. Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi released a special Rs 5 postage stamp bearing the image of Rasa Periyago. Union Minister GK Vasan received it. A prototype of the special postage stamp was unveiled by Chief Minister Karunanidhi in front. Later Union Minister S.S. Palanimanikkam Periya Kovil and 5 rupees coin engraved with Rajarajan's image was released which was received by Union Minister Narayanasamy. From the morning of the first day of the festival, various street performances by folk artists were held in various parts of the city. In the evening, a grand performance was held at Tanjore Periya Temple in which thousands of dancers participated under the leadership of Padma Subramaniam on behalf of the All India Bharatanatyam Artists Association. The dance program was preceded by a Nataswara music program and after the dance program, a Thirumpi music program by 100 Odhuvars was conducted. On the second day in the morning there was a laboratory in Tanjore Tamil University, a public hall in Tanjore Periya Temple, and in the evening, in the presence of Chief Minister Karunanidhi in front of Tanjore Tilak temple, the events of launching commemorative coin and postage stamp of Tanjore Periya temple and starting basic infrastructure facilities for Tanjore city were held. A historical exhibition was also held[21]. Opinions and facts There is a belief among the people that the shadow of the tower of the Tanjore Great Temple does not fall to the ground. But the plane shadow of this temple is arranged in such a way that it falls on the ground.

"Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) are annual plants native to the Americas. They have a large inflorescence (bouquet). narrative  In this the so-called flower is actually a cluster of large number of small flowers (small flowers) grouped together (formally compound flower). The external florets are sterile, strap-like florets that may be yellow, lacquer-colored, reddish-yellow, or other colors. The florets inside the round cluster are called panicles, which mature into seeds. The florets within a sunflower cluster are arranged in a spiral pattern. Typically each floret is aligned at approximately a golden angle of 137.5° to the next floret, creating a pattern of interlocking coils. Here the number of left coils and the number of right coils are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Typically, there are 34 coils in one direction and 55 in the other direction; A large sunflower may have 89 in one direction and 144 in the other.[1][2][3] This design results in more efficient seed filling within the inflorescence.[4][5][6] Light stimulation Sunflowers in the bud stage show photophobia. At sunrise, most sunflowers face east. As the day progresses, they also follow the sun from east to west, while at night they return to the east again. This movement is caused by motor cells in the petiole, the flexible part of the stem just below the bud. When the bud stage is over, the stem stiffens and reaches the flowering stage. Sunflowers in the flowering stage lose their ability to produce light. The shaft usually becomes ""frozen"" in an easterly orientation. Stem and leaves lose their green color. Wild sunflowers do not specifically face the sun; Its flowering clusters may point in several directions when mature. However, the leaves may exhibit some anti-inflammatory properties. History Sunflower is native to Central America. Evidence that it was first cultivated in Mexico at least 2600 years BC supports this.[7] It may have been cultivated a second time in the central Mississippi Valley, or it may have been introduced earlier when corn was introduced from Mexico. The earliest known examples of fully cultivated sunflowers in northern Mexico have been found in Tennessee around 2300 BC. Many Native American peoples used the sunflower as a symbol of their sun god, including the Aztecs of Mexico and the Atomi and Incas of South America. Francisco Pizarro was the first European to encounter sunflowers in Tahuandinsuyo, Peru. Gold images of the flower, along with the seeds, were taken back to Spain in the early 16th century. Some researchers argue that the Spanish tried to prevent the cultivation of the sunflower because of its association with solar worship and warfare.[8] During the 18th century, the use of sunflower oil became popular in Europe, especially with members of the Russian Orthodox Church, as sunflower oil was one of the few oils not forbidden during Lent. Cultivation and uses Sunflowers need full sun to grow best. They grow best in rich, moist, well-drained soil with plenty of potting mix. In commercial cultivation, seeds are sown 45cm (1.5ft) apart and 2.5cm (1in) deep. Sunflower ""whole seed"" (fruit) is roasted in ovens with or without salt and sold as a snack. Sunflowers can be processed into sunbutter as a peanut butter substitute. In Germany, it is combined with rye flour to make Sonnenblumenkernbrot (literally: sunflower whole seed bread), which is very popular in German-speaking European countries. It is also sold as bird feed and can be used directly in cooking and in green vegetable mixes. Sunflower oil extracted from the seeds is used as a carrier oil for cooking and is also used in butter (margarine) and biodiesel production as it is cheaper than olive oil. There are a wide variety of sunflowers with varying fat content; Some 'high oleic' types of oil contain even more healthy unsaturated fats than olive oil.  After processing the seeds to extract oil, the remaining pulp can be used as animal fodder. Some recently developed species have drooping inflorescences. These species are less attractive to gardeners who grow flowers as ornamental plants, but are in demand by farmers because they reduce losses from bird damage and some plant diseases. Sunflowers also produce latex and are being tested to develop them as an alternative plant for making less allergenic rubber. Traditionally, many Native American groups planted sunflowers on the northern borders of their gardens as a ""fourth sister"" to the well-known Three Sisters suitable corn, sorghum, and pumpkin.[9] Annual species are often cultivated for their chemical-secreting properties. However, sunflowers remain another undesirable plant for commercial farmers growing commodity crops, often considered a weed. Especially in the American Midwest, wild (perennial) species are often found in corn and soybean fields, which can have a negative impact on yield. Sunflowers may also be used to extract toxins such as lead, arsenic and uranium from the soil. These were used to remove uranium, cesium-137 and durantium-90 from soil after the Chernobyl disaster (see Plant remediation). A mathematical model of microflora arrangement  A model of the flower arrangement of the sunflower bouquet was presented in 1979 by H. Vogel proposed.[10] It is reported in orientational coordinates     r = c   n   ,   {\displaystyle r=c{\sqrt {n}},}       i = n ×  137.5  ∘   ,   {\displaystyle \theta =n\times 137.5^{\circ },}   Here θ is the angle, r is the radius or distance from the center, n is the pointer number of the microsphere and c is a constant scaling factor. This is Fermat's spiral form. The angle 137.5° is related to the golden ratio, giving a close layer of petals. This model has been used to create computer graphic representations of sunflowers.[11] Size Sunflowers typically grow between 1.5 and 3.5 m (8–12 ft) tall. Scientific literature dating back to 1567 states that the 12-m (40 ft), traditional, single-flowered, sunflower plant was cultivated in Padua. These same seeds have at other times grown to nearly eight meters (26 ft) in other places (eg Madrid). The most recent occurrences (last twenty years) of growing more than eight meters have occurred in both the Netherlands and Ontario, Canada. cultural identity The sunflower is the state flower of the US state of Kansas, and Kitakyushu is one of the city flowers of Japan. Just as the red rose is a symbol of Samadharma or social democracy, the sunflower is often used as a symbol of green policy. The sunflower is also a symbol of the vegetarian community. During the late nineteenth century, the flower became a symbol of the artistic movement. The subject of Van Gogh's most famous painting is Sunflowers (series of paintings). The national flower of Ukraine is the sunflower.

The Land Institute and other breeding programs are currently exploring the possibility of growing these as a perennial seed crop. Sunchok (Jerusalem artichoke or Helianthus tuberosus) is related to the sunflower and is another example of a perennial sunflower. The Mexican sunflower is Tithonia rotundifolia. It is most distantly related to North American sunflowers. False sunflower refers to plants of the genus Heliopsis.

"Vijay (English: Vijay, born: June 22, 1974; birth name: Joseph Vijay[1]) is a Tamil film actor. In the beginning, he was accompanied by his father, S. A. He used to act in films directed by Chandrasekhar. He retained his position after about 10 films. He is currently seen as one of the leading actors in the Tamil film industry. Vijay's fans call him ""Ilayayathalapati"". He has fans in China,[2] Japan[3], United Kingdom[4] and France, including the Indian diaspora.[5] His films have been released on five continents and eighty countries.[6][7] Vijay made his debut as a child star at the age of 10 in the film Vetri (1984). He continued to act as a child star until his father's film Ehtu Aam Neeti (1988). Later, at the age of 18, he played the lead role for the first time in his father's film Tomorrow's Verdict (1992). But Vikraman's film Poove Unakakka (1996) was his turning point.[8][9] Till date, Vijay has acted in 62 films as the protagonist. He has won 50 awards including 3 Tamil Nadu Government Film Awards, 1 Cosmopolitan Award, 1 India Today Award, 1 Sima Award, 8 Vijay Awards, 3 Edison Awards, 2 Vikatan Awards. He has been nominated once for the United Kingdom National Film Awards.[10] As a playback singer, Vijay has sung 32 songs from Bombay City (1994) to Papa Papa (2017). Apart from acting and singing, she is also an excellent dancer.[11] His films have been screened at the Shanghai International Film Festival in China[12], the Melbourne International Film Festival in Australia[13] and the Bucheon International Film Festival in South Korea.[14] Early life and family Vijay was born on 22 June 1974 in Madras (now Chennai). His birth name is Joseph Vijay. His father S. A. Chandrasekhar is a Tamil film director and mother Shobha is a playback singer and Karunataka singer. Vijay had a sister named Vidya. He died at the age of two. Vidya's death affected Vijay a lot. According to Vijay's mother Vijay was very talkative, mischievous and playful as a child. He became silent after Vidya's death.[15] The story of his younger sister Vidya was told in the 2005 film Shukran. Vijay made an extended cameo appearance in the film.[16] Vijay spent his entire childhood in Chennai. Vijay initially started his studies at Fatima Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Kodambakkam.[17] Later he joined Balalok Matriculation High School in Virugambakkam.[18] Attended Loyola College to pursue a degree in Visual Communications. He eventually dropped out halfway through his studies to pursue acting.[15] Vijay married British-born Hindu Sri Lankan Tamil Sangeetha Sornalingam on 25 August 1999. Their wedding took place in both Hindu and Christian ways.[19][20] They have two children. A son, Jason Sanjay, born in London in 2000[21] and a daughter, Divya Sasha, born in Chennai in 2005.[22] Jason Sanjay made a cameo appearance in his father's film The Hunter (2009). Divya Sasha played a small role in Theri (2016) as her father's pre-teen daughter. Film industry Vijay has been acting in his father's films since childhood. Then he started acting as a hero.

Three symptoms have been identified in such poliovirus infections: upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever), gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea), and influenza-like illness. 1-2 % of infections develop into non-rheumatic disseminated encephalitis (sign of neck, back and/or leg stiffness). These symptoms persist for several days like a minor illness. Excessive or abnormal sensations occur. These symptoms last for 2-10 days and then disappear completely. Less than 1% of all polio cases manifest as muscle wasting. Juvenile rheumatism symptoms usually begin 1-10 days after a minor illness. After the fever has normalized, no further paralysis occurs. Symptoms initially include loss of superficial reflexes with increased tendon activity, severe muscle pain, and limb or back spasms. The reflexes of the hypothalamus are reduced and the disease becomes rheumatism. It remains unchanged for days or weeks. In this case it will look asymmetrical. Then strength begins to return. The patient does not experience any numbness or cognitive changes. The major parts of the body such as arms, legs and spinal cord become weak. In a few days, fever and chills; The head is heavy; There will be unrelenting pain all over the body.[2] problems Juvenile rheumatism can cause permanent muscle paralysis, deformities of the hips, ankles, and feet, and disability. Although many deformities can be corrected through surgery and physical therapy, these treatment methods are not feasible in developing countries. Because of this, children who survive juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have to live with severe disabilities. It causes the following effects. Pneumonia Ventricular hypertension Immobility Lung problems Pulmonary edema shocked Permanent muscle paralysis Urinary tract infection Diagnosis Virus isolation Poliovirus is picked up from the stool or throat of a person with polio. Diagnosis is by isolation of virus from cerebrospinal fluid. But it is rarely possible. Virus isolated from a person with severe rheumatoid arthritis should be tested further. Oligonucleotide mapping or genomic sequencing can determine whether the virus is wild-type or vaccine-type (derived from a vaccine strain). Uneerial Equalizing antibodies are present early and become more abundant as the patient is admitted to the hospital. Thus the four-fold increase cannot be shown by the antibody catalysis test. Cerebrospinal fluid The white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid is usually high (10-20 cells/mm3, mostly platelets) if there is a juvenile infectious disease. Also, protein levels are slightly increased (40–50 mg/100 mL). Disease management Juvenile rheumatism cannot be cured. So the patient is given supportive care. Symptomatic treatment is given until the patient recovers. Medicines, exercises and balanced diet should be given for polio symptoms. prevention Juvenile arthritis has so far been an incurable disease. So prevention is the only way to protect and control the disease. There are two types of vaccines: denatured polio vaccine and oral polio vaccine. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is given by injection, depending on the age. Polio vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines. Immunization should be given in childhood. Children should be given 4 doses of de-immunized juvenile rheumatism at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months and a booster dose at 4-6 years. Oral polio vaccine contains a combination of live and attenuated poliovirus strains from all three poliovirus types. Children below 5 years of age are given oral vaccine twice a year under the polio drip program. Children are safeguarded and provide comprehensive protection in the community. In 1952, Jonas Salk, an American doctor, discovered the polio vaccine. He refused to patent the life-saving vaccine he had invented. My invention was like the sun. Everyone should benefit. It was Salk who refused to ask whether Surya could apply for a patent. In 1957, another American doctor named 'Albert Sabin' (Albert Sabin) discovered a preventive medicine for the same disease. It was easier and less expensive to give children the polio vaccine by drop. Thus, the Indian government made the people aware that 'polio drops can be prevented if children are properly vaccinated'.[3] World Polio Drip Day is observed on June 16 every year across the world. In India, polio drops are administered twice a year to children under 5 years of age to eradicate juvenile polio. In less than 1% of affected individuals, the malignancy invades the central nervous system and attacks motor neurons, weakening the ligaments and producing severe flaccid paralysis. A variety of paralytic conditions can occur depending on the nerves that are affected. Juvenile rheumatism involving the spine is the most common. It usually affects the legs. Juvenile arthritis in India In 2009, 741 cases of juvenile polio were reported in India. The last case of juvenile polio in India was reported on January 13, 2011 in the state of West Bengal. An 18-year-old girl was infected there. India achieved the status of declaring itself polio-free on 13 January 2014 as no child was infected with polio for three consecutive years. Although the Indian government's announcement comes on 13 January 2014, the World Health Organization will issue its certificate on 11 February after testing some of the last test samples from India.[4] The water from the Amberpet canal in Telangana's capital, Hyderabad, was tested and found to be contaminated with poliovirus.[5] Effects There has been no polio in Tamil Nadu for the last 10 years. But in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi and Chandigarh, children were affected by polio till December 2010. Similarly, states like Aryana, Panjai, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and West Bengal had sporadic polio cases in 2010. Vaccination Polio has been completely eradicated in India by oral drops administered to children. Medical researchers have found that one in 10 million children who are vaccinated will contract polio from the vaccine. Therefore, it is best to vaccinate children against polio, researchers suggest. In various countries like America, France, Japan, Germany, England etc. they have stopped giving polio drops by mouth. They only give polio vaccine. Polio vaccination can prevent 100 percent of polio cases. Therefore, the government should take steps to vaccinate children against polio in India as in other countries.[6] Quotations  External links  Category:Infectious diseases ",When was polio eradicated from India?,13 January 2014,8197
"Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational software technology company. It is the largest software company in the world. It is involved in the production, development, ownership and support of various types of computer software. It is headquartered in Redmond, Washington. It was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975. Microsoft is the world's largest software maker by revenue.[4] It is also the company with the highest total market capitalization worldwide.[5] Windows operating systems and Microsoft Office are its main products. Microsoft started out as a company that developed and sold BASIC translator software for the Altair 8800. Later, it introduced the MSDOS operating system in the 1980s and became a pioneer in the production of stand-alone desktop operating systems. In turn, Microsoft developed and sold a series of graphical operating systems called Windows. Thus Microsoft reached the position of ""Microsoft's software in every home and every desk"". In 1986, Microsoft made three of its employees billionaires and 12,000 millionaires thanks to the initial public holidays and subsequent stock price booms. Since the 1990s it has expanded itself from the operating system market through acquisitions and mergers. In 2011 it bought Izukai Technology for $8.5 billion; It was the largest acquisition to date.[6] As of 2013, Microsoft is the leader in desktop and laptop operating systems and office productivity software applications (especially with Microsoft Office). It also develops and sells various software applications for desktop computers and laptops. It also seeks to dominate Internet search engines, the virtual game industry (with Xbox and Xbox 360 offerings), the digital services market (via MSN), and mobile phones (via the Windows Phone operating system). In June 2012, Microsoft entered the PC vendor market for the first time with its Microsoft Surface handheld computer. In the 1990s Microsoft was accused of engaging in proprietary business practices and anti-competitive practices. Lawsuits were filed alleging that it imposed unreasonable restrictions on the use of its software and used false information in its marketing efforts. The United States Department of Justice and the European Commission found that Microsoft acted illegally. Company The name ""Microsoft"" is a portmanteau of the English words microcomputer software. Bill Gates first mentioned ""micro-soft"" in a letter to Paul Allen in July, 1975.[7] The current form was incorporated in the state of New Mexico on November 26, 1976[8]. The company is headquartered in Redmond, Washington state, United States. This is why Microsoft is sometimes called the Redmond Company. The company's operating platform, Windows, has been released in multiple versions and is a fixture in the computer world. The company has 88,000 employees working in many countries around the world. Since January 14, 2000, Steve Palmer has been the Chairman. On 4 February 2014, Satya Nadella was appointed as the CEO of Microsoft. He is an Indian.

"Karnataka (Karnāṭaka) is a state in the southern part of India. The state was formed on November 1, 1956 under the States Reorganization Act. Formerly known as Mysore State, this state was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The state of Karunadaka is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. The state covers an area of ​​74,122 square miles, i.e. 191,976 sq km. It is 5.83% of the total area of ​​India. Consisting of 30 districts, the state is the eighth largest state in India by area and the ninth most populous state in India. Kannada is the official and widely spoken language. Although various etymologies have been suggested for the name Karunadakam, it is generally believed that it is derived from the Kannada words 'karu' and 'nadu'. These words mean upland. The British referred to this state as Carnatic and sometimes as Karnataka. With its Paleolithic heritage, Karunadaka was home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. Philosophers and musicians supported by these empires started religious, economic and literary movements. It is remarkable that they have survived to this day. In India, Kannada language writers have received the highest number of Jnan Peetha awards. Bengaluru, the state capital, is at the forerunner of the economic and technological progress that India is experiencing. History   The history of Karunadaka can be traced through the hand axes and other finds found in the area and its connection with the ancient hand ax culture. Evidence of Neolithic culture has also been found in the state.[8][9] As the gold found in Harappa, a remnant of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, is known to belong to the Karunadaka gold deposits, it is clear that the Karunadaka region has been advanced in trade and culture since ancient times. About 3 centuries before the Common Era, a large part of the Karunadaka was under the Nanda Empire before it fell under the Mauryan rule of Emperor Ashoka. Four centuries of Satavahana rule largely helped to bring Karunadama under their control. The fall of the Satavahanas paved the way for the rise of the first kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Upper Ganga, who were based on Karunadaka. That paved the way for the region to enter and identify as a non-partisan political entity. The Kadamba dynasty, founded by Maurya Sharma, had Banavasi as its capital.[10][11] Similarly, the Upper Gangar dynasty was established with Tallaght as its capital.[12][13] Gadambara, Chalukya Kannada was the first administrative language of the Gadamba dynasty as evidenced by the Kalamithi inscription and the fifth century copper coins [14][15]. The Chalukyas who brought the entire Deccan under their rule are credited with incorporating the entire Karunadaka.[16][17][18][19][20][21] The Chalukyas greatly developed architecture, Kannada literature, and music.[22][23] Visayanagar Empire, Islamic rule  In 1565, not only Karunadaka but the whole of South India underwent a major political change. The Visayanagara Empire, which had been strong for centuries, was defeated by the Islamic Sultanate. After Bijapur Sultanate ruled for a short time, then transferred to the Mughals in the 17th century. During the sultanate's reigns, Urdu and Persian literature also flourished. After this, northern Karunadaka was ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad and southern Karnataka by the Wodiyars of Mysore. After the death of Kritinarasa Wodeyar II, the king of Mysore, the general Hyder Ali took over. After winning many battles with the British, his son Tipu Sultan took over and opposed the British. The Mysore kingdom was merged with the British in 1799 with the death of Tipu Sultan in the fourth war with the British. Geography Karunadak is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. Karunadama is mostly found in hilly areas. The southern part of the Karunadaka state is located at the junction of the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats. River Cauvery begins with Karunadama.   The state consists of 3 main landmasses namely the Karavali coastal plain, the hilly highlands of the Western Ghats and the Payaluseema plains of the Deccan Plateau. Major part of the state is the arid plains of Byaluseema. Name [24]. The rivers that flow in Karunatham are: Kaveri, Tungabhadra, Krishna River and Saravati. Four seasons are perceived in Karunadama. Winter is felt in January and February, summer is in March and May, monsoon season is from June to September and monsoon season is from October to December.

"Palmyra Palm is a genus of plants belonging to the genus Pullinum. In scientific classification, it is included in the genus Borassus. This genus includes many species. Palms are not usually cultivated, but grow and multiply naturally in nature. Young palms are called vadali. The palm is said to take up to 15 years to grow to maturity. It may be noted that its age is about the same as the average age of a human being. Palms can grow up to about 30 meters in height without any noticeable curves. Branches are also available. At its top, there are about 30-40 fan-shaped leaves arranged in a circle. Palm is the state tree of Tamil Nadu  Nomenclature Although it is given in Tamil as a tree in the general case, it does not depend on the type of tree. A palm tree is wrong not only in terms of modern botany but also according to Tamil grammatical conventions. Tolkappiyam, the oldest grammar book in Tamil, defines the difference between pul and mariam as follows. (Song 630) (Song 631) Due to its many long-term benefits, the palm tree is compared to the palm tree, which is said to be the heavenly tree that gives what is asked for. There are a total of 34 species of palm trees. They are 1. Male palm, 2. Female palm, 3. Koontapanai, 4. Talipanai, 5. Kumudipanai, 6. Saattupanai, 7. Eechampanai, 8. Eehapanai, 9. Seemaipanai, 10. Aadhampanai, 11. Thippilippanai, 12. Chilopanai, 13. Kichilippanai, 14. Kudaippanai, 15. Yubangpanai 16. Koaraippanai, 17. Idukuppanai, 18. Dadampanai, 19. Kanthampanai, 20. Pakuppanai, 21. Erampanai, 22. Chinapanai, 23. Kunduppanai, 24. Alampanai, 25. Kondaipanai . Children Plants of the genus Borasasu (palm). Borassus aethiopum - African palm tree (Borassus aethiopum) go Akesi - West African Palm (Borassus akeassii – Ake Assi`s Palmyra Palm (West Africa)) go Borassus flabellifer – Asian Palmyra Palm (southern Asia and southeast Asia) go Borassus heineanus – New Guinea Palmyra Palm (New Guinea) go Borassus madagascariensis – Madagascar Palmyra Palm (Madagascar) go Borassus sambiranensis – Sambirano Palmyra Palm (Madagascar) Locations found It is said to be native to Africa. Wherever the human race migrated from Africa, it is said that the primitive people took palm seeds with them. This is because palm trees are often found near populated areas. This is attributed to the fact that it is often not found in dense forests.[1] It is only in Asian countries where palms are found. Today in Asia they are found in countries like India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, China and West African countries like Congo.  According to a survey by the Kadhi and Village Industry Commission, there are 10.2 crore palm trees in India. There are 5 crore palm trees in Tamil Nadu alone.[2] Among these, 50 percent of forest trees are dense in Nellai, Thoothukudi and Ramanathapuram districts. Salem, Namakkal, Chennai, Chengalpattu and Sivaganga districts are abundant. The number of trees in other districts is less than 30 lakh. Benefits of Palm The palm tree provides food and food items. Padanir is the first food item. This takes the form of various food items like blackcurrant, jaggery, banana, banana fruit, banana candy, banana pulp. Food products derived from palm are palm tusks, brushes, straws, palm products, decorative items, wood and wooden products. According to Khadar and Chittoor Industries Group, a palm tree is capable of producing 150 liters of water, 1 kg of thumbu, 1.5 kg of sapwood, 8 leaves and 16 fiber hairs in a year. It is also calculated that 24 kg of palm jaggery, 2 baskets, 2 brushes and 6 mats can be obtained from one palm tree. India earns more than 200 crores of foreign exchange annually by exporting palm products to countries like USA, Britain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, France, Australia, Japan etc. Within the country, edible palm products are mostly sent to Goa, Kanyakumari and Bellary for sale. Goa is leading among these. After agriculture and handloom, the palm industry is considered to be the largest source of employment. In 1985-86, the palm industry provided 6.94 lakh employment opportunities at the national level and 5.87 lakh employment opportunities at the Tamil Nadu level. These include palm workers, jaggery women, thump artisans and traders. This industry will provide employment opportunities to 10 lakh people in Tamil Nadu alone if all trees suitable for palm cultivation except young trees are used. The Tribulations of the Palm  to Banankar Panangaruks are very bitter to palm trees. Those sharp thorn-like formations give trouble to palm trees. Panangai  Panangai or panai varichal is a long log of palm tree by sawing it lengthwise. It is used in building roofs. Palm plantation Palm plantation is a seasonal industry. Palm cultivation takes place from April to August in Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi and Nellie districts, from August to March in Kanyakumari district and from April to October in Salem and Dharmapuri districts. As it is a seasonal industry, there is a lot of migration in search of work in these districts. Cultivation is a profession that involves various skills such as tree picking, flower ripening, sap collection. A wooden chest strap, mid-war, and thala are used. During this work, when the body rubs against the rough part of the tree, the body loses luster. There are no mechanical devices to eliminate the risk and suffering of tree climbing. A tree averages 36 to 42 meters in height. So climbing 30 to 40 trees twice a day is very risky. So palm tree pickers are very experienced. They climb the palm tree by tying a rope to their feet. Palm workers status More than 80 percent of palm workers live below the poverty line. A palm worker earns up to 15 rupees for working 10 to 15 hours a day. So the family income of a palm worker depends on the number of palm trees he grows and the number of workers in his family. Majority of palm workers do not own trees. A survey revealed that 67.85% of palm growing families in Tamil Nadu do not have their own trees. Apart from Kanyakumari district, in other districts of Tamil Nadu, landowners lease palm trees and hire people for low wages to extract water. Banana juice is beneficial for the body. It contains fat, protein, minerals, bio-nutrients, iron, iron, lime and carbon dioxide. It is nutritious. Easily digestible. It is considered to be curative for osteoporosis and a good remedy for liver disease. Not less than 25% of padanir is consumed directly. The rest is used to make jaggery. Most of the jaggery produced is sold locally. Due to urgent need of money, ignorance of market price and lack of time to market they are exploited by middlemen. palm industry There are also problems in the production and marketing of food additives. Inadequate investment and lack of workforce are said to be major problems. Due to the fact that the palm industry is not able to attract a large number of workers, the industry is gradually declining due to its low income. However, the palm industry is a major employer; Food and edible palm products are in demand both domestically and abroad.Vellidai Hill. The Palm Workers Development Society in Marthanda saw that the former problems could be tackled proactively by producing value-added food items like palm kernels. It was found that making palm sugar is more profitable than brewing jaggery with water. The improvement in the life of the palm workers and the development of the industry has been proven beyond doubt. Co-operatives, NGOs and private sector are involved in setting up food and palm products manufacturing units. Design training, decentralization of production facilities, proper investment and marketing facilities have increased the production and marketing of food products. The Palm Workers Development Association is a pioneer in improving the lives of palm workers across Tamil Nadu by making them aware of the potential of the palm industry.

"An elephant is a herbivorous (leaf-eating) mammal. It is the largest of all land animals. It is also very long-lived (~70 years). It is the longest living land animal besides humans. Elephants are very strong. The beasts of prey and the highest in the food hierarchy of wild animals, the lion (Arima), the tiger, etc., are unapproachable in strength. Lions gang up and kill a tired or young elephant that might come alone. However, such incidents are very rare. Elephants live in families. Also, they have high memory capacity. Only three elephants remain in the world today. They are African bush elephants, African forest elephants and Asian elephants. There are significant differences between them. Generally, all elephants live up to about 70 years. A male elephant is called Kaliru. A female elephant is called Bd. A baby elephant is called a calf or cub. The sound made by an elephant is called bellowing. Elephants  African elephants are larger in stature than Asian elephants. They have large ear lobes. Both male and female African elephants have tusks. However, ivory is rarely found in Asian female elephants. The back of African elephants curves slightly inwards behind the head and is flat without raised forehead ridges. These have two petals at the apex of the thallus. But the front feet have four or five claws and the hind feet have three claws. Asian elephants have slightly raised backs. There are two ridges on the forehead and small ear lobes. There is only one petal at the apex of the thallus (upper margin). The front feet have five claws and the hind feet have four claws. Food and vegetables Elephants are herbivores or herbivores. They like to eat bamboo and sugarcane. They spend 16 hours a day gathering food. Also, their digestive capacity is very slow. Therefore, 40 percent of these foods are digested. Hence, they tend to consume a lot of food. Well-grown elephants consume about 140 to 270 kg of food per day. Physique  Male elephants are usually 3 meters tall and weigh 6000 kilograms. Elephant skin is very thick. There will be a thickness of about 3 cm. However, it will be slow. Thus, mosquitoes etc. will also bite. An elephant has four strong legs. Despite its bulky body, the elephant can climb and descend hills and steep places efficiently. The proverb ""the foot of an elephant glides"" is a reference to the elephant's ability to walk in long ups and downs. Trunk An elephant's special feature is its trunk. It is best seen only in elephants. Although a few animals have a slightly elongated frontal nose (like the proboscis monkey), there are no animals with long trunk-like limbs. The trunk is made up of a total of 40,000 muscles. It is flexible in all directions. At the tip of the trunk are the nostrils through which the elephant breathes, and tiny, highly sensitive fingertips.[1] The trunk can lift anything from a small stick to a large tree. They usually help in picking up food and drinking water. The elephant repels attacks from hostile animals with its trunk. Because the neck is short the prominence of the trunk is great. Ivory  Elephants have two tusks. These are called elephant lines. This elephant coat is present only in male elephants (Kalurukku) in Asiatic Indian elephants and not in female elephants (Pitukku). But African wild elephants, both male and female, have a stripe (both male and female). The elephants living in Sumatra and Borneo, the elephants of Sri Lanka, are bisexual (Kaliru, Pd) and often have an elephant line. An elephant's tusk is an extension of an elephant's molars. Hence these are also called elephant's tusks or tusks (tusks and tusks mean teeth). Tusks can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet). And they can weigh up to 90 kilograms. These tusks are also used for trade. In March 2015, Ethiopia burned six tons of ivory taken from several elephants.[2] skin Elephant skin is very thick. Thick skin is found in most parts of the body. The skin is about two and a half centimeters thick. However, the skin around its mouth and inside the ear is thin. Asian elephants generally have more hair on their skin than African elephants. Elephants usually smear mud or dirt all over their bodies. This is an important characteristic of elephant society. It helps to protect the skin of the elephant from the sun's heat and radiation. Although the elephant's skin is thick, it is very sensitive. This is why elephants spit mud or dirt after bathing. legs  They have strong legs to support the elephant's large body. They don't need much muscle power to stand because of their straight legs and wide feet. So they can stand for a long time without resting. African elephants often do not sit unless they are sick or injured. But Asian elephants rest often. The elephant has got a broad round foot (foot). The African elephant has three tusks (claws) on its hind legs and four on its front legs. The Asian elephant has four tusks on the hind legs and five on the front legs. Elephants can swim and climb well. These cannot be jumped. ears Elephants have fairly large broad lobed ears. They play an important role in maintaining the elephant's body temperature. Elephant's ears are full of blood vessels. The ambient air cools down as the heated blood flows into the ears. Then it goes into the body and lowers the temperature. Due to blood circulation, this process is continuous and the temperature is kept under control. This is why elephants are always seen moving their ears. The upper margin of a grown elephant's ear is folded outward in the Asian elephant, and curled inward in the African elephant.[3] Cognition  An elephant's brain is the largest among land animals. It weighs a little over five kilograms. Elephants have good memory. After elephants and dolphins, elephants are considered to be the most intelligent animals. Elephants are said to be second to humans in intelligence. Elephant brains are also superior in structure and technique. They also learn to use tools. Elephants are generally compassionate.[4] sensory perception Elephants have excellent hearing and sense of smell. The elephant's eye is slightly myopic. Thus, an elephant relies on its keen sense of hearing and subtle sense of smell rather than its sight.[5] Their trunks are also sensitive. Not only their ears but also their trunks are capable of sensing vibrations. Their feet are capable of sensing very low frequency sound waves. Social life The social life style of greens is different from the life style of pits. Embryos live with their mother's group until they reach puberty, then mostly alone. But the Bds live as a well-knit family of mother, sister and daughter. Adolescence is also observed during the breeding season. self awareness Elephants are self-aware. It is established by glass testing. Elephants recognize themselves when placed in front of a mirror. This ability has so far only been found in baboons, some monkeys, and dolphins. A study conducted among domesticated elephants in Zimbabwe suggests that elephants have the ability to understand a person's pointing.[6] Breeding  The gestation period of an elephant is 22 months. This is the longest gestation period in mammals. They usually give birth to only one calf. Twins are very rare. A newborn baby elephant weighs between 90 – 115 kilograms. Before, during, and after calving, the elephant is greatly assisted by the presence of other adult elephants. From birth, the calf is raised by the herd. threats Hunting A major threat to elephants is poaching. Elephants are hunted for their tusks. Large, long-lived and slow-breeding elephants, over-hunting has a major impact. They are large and cannot be hidden easily. Each elephant takes years to grow and breed. Each elephant needs an average of 140 kilograms (300 pounds) of leaves per day. Due to the destruction of large animals like tigers and lions, small herbivores competing for elephants' food are multiplying and destroying plants, making it difficult for elephants to get food. Elephants are rarely killed for food by animals other than humans. Shrinking habitat  Another important threat is the destruction of elephant habitats. Humans are destroying elephant habitats for agricultural expansion. This creates conflicts between the interests of humans and the interests of elephants. For example, elephants enter new agricultural settlements, destroying crops and endangering lives of people. An average of 150 elephants and 100 humans die in Sri Lanka every year due to such conflicts. Deforestation also reduces the habitat of elephants. Habitat loss is said to be the primary reason for the extinction of Asian elephants. Elephants require large areas of forest to survive. Because elephants enter an area in droves and destroy trees and plant vines. Then they go somewhere else. Thus the destroyed forests go to new places and re-grow and come back to the same place and get food. As habitats shrink, food runs out very quickly.[7] Humans and elephants  As elephants are killed legally and against the law by humans, unexpected consequences occur in the elephant's body. Ivory poachers in Africa hunt elephants with large tusks, leaving the remaining elephants with small tusks or no tusks. Newly born cubs are also more likely to be born with these, leading to the addition of tuskless genes in new generations, leading to the birth of large numbers of tuskless elephants. The number of such elephants has increased from 1% in 1930 to 30% in some areas. Edentulism was once a rare genetic mutation and is now becoming a common hereditary trait. Death Elephants can die from cardiac problems, heart attacks, and brain hemorrhages.[8] Elephant in Sangam literature Elephant is mentioned in more than 170 names in Tamil Sangha literature. Some of them are as follows; 1. Elephant, 2. Velam, 3. Kaliru, 4. Pliru, 5. Kalapam, 6. Matangam, 7. Kaima, 8. Umbal - , 9. Varanam, 10. Anjanavati, 11. Athi, 12. Athini, 13. .Government, 14.

"Association of Southeast Asian Nations[5] (Association of Southeast Asian Nations),[6] or ASEAN (ASEAN /ˈɑːsi.ɑːn/ AH-see-ahn,[7] /ˈɑːzi.ɑːn/ AH-zee-ahn)[8] [9], is an economic, and geographical political confederation of 10 countries in Southeast Asia. It was established on August 8, 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand [10]. After that, Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam joined this federation. The main objectives of this organization are to promote economic development, maintain social and cultural relations among member countries, maintain peace in the region, and provide opportunity for member countries to discuss with other countries[11]. The ASEAN organization covers a land area of ​​4.46 million km2. It is 3% of the total world area. The population of this region is nearly 600 million. This is 8.8% of the total world population. The sea area of ​​ASEAN is three times larger than its land area. In 2011, the combined gross national product of the region grew by more than US$2 trillion.[12] If ASEAN is considered as a separate organization, it would be the eighth largest economic organization in the world. History Association of Southeast Asia was the predecessor of ASEAN. It was commonly known as ASA. This federation was started in 1961 and includes the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand. The ASEAN Federation was established on August 8, 1967, when the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand in Bangkok and signed the ""ASEAN Declaration"". This ASEAN Declaration is commonly known as the ""Bangkok Declaration"". Adam Malik of Indonesia, Narquiso Ramos of the Philippines, Abdul Razak of Malaysia, C. Rajaratnam and Thanat Koman of Thailand are the five foreign ministers who signed the declaration. They are known as the founders of this ASEAN Federation.[13] Objectives According to the ASEAN Declaration, the objectives of the formation of ASEAN are; To increase the economic development of Southeast Asian countries through joint efforts and to bring about socio-cultural development. To establish peace and stability in the region through respect for justice and the rule of law and adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. To bring about development in economic, social, cultural, technological, scientific and administrative fields through intensive cooperation and mutual assistance. To assist other countries by establishing training and research facilities in the fields of education, industry, technology, and administration. Emphasis was placed on their agricultural and handicraft use, expansion of trade, improvement of transportation facilities, and establishment of communication facilities. Developing Southeast Asian Curriculum. Establish close and beneficial relations with international and regional organizations with similar objectives.[14][15] Continued expansion The development of the federation began with Brunei joining the federation as its sixth member on 8 January 1984, a week after independence on 1 January 1984.[16] On 28 July 1995, Vietnam joined the alliance as its seventh member.[17] Laos and Myanmar joined ASEAN on 23 July 1997, two years after Vietnam joined.[18] Cambodia was also due to join ASEAN along with Laos and Myanmar but was unable to join due to internal political strife. Cambodia later joined the ASEAN on 30 April 1999 following its political commitment.[18][19] The 1990s saw an increase in the number of ASEAN members and further integration among countries. Malaysia decided to form the East Asian Economic Community in 1990.[20] Through this, the purpose of this group is to control the increasing influence of the United States in the Asia-Pacific Economic Association, including the members of the ASEAN Federation and countries such as the Republic of China, Japan, and South Korea.[21][22] The plan was abandoned due to massive opposition from the United States and Japan.[21][23] Despite the failure of this project, the member states continued their work for further integration and in 1997, ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN Plus Three) was formed. East Timor and Papua New Guinea In March 2011, East Timor submitted a letter of application to join the ASEAN as the eleventh member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) during the Official ASEAN Summit in Jakarta. Indonesia extended a warm welcome to East Timor.[24][25][26] Papua New Guinea gained observer status in 1976 and special observer status in 1981.[27] Papua New Guinea is a Melanesian state. Free trade In 2007 ASEAN celebrated its 40th anniversary and 30 years of diplomatic relations with the United States.[28] It was decided on 26 August 2007 to establish free trade agreements with China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand by 2013 and to establish the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015.[29][30] A free trade agreement was signed on 27 February 2009 between the member states of ASEAN and Australia and New Zealand. The free trade agreement was created with the goal of increasing the gross domestic product of the 12 countries by US$48 billion annually between 2000 and 2020.[31][32] The ASEAN member states and their six major trading partners, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea, opened the preliminary round of talks on regional broader economic cooperation in Bali, Indonesia, from 26–28 February 2013.[33] The ASEAN way  Basic principles Independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and mutual respect for the national identities of all member states. It is the right of every state to pursue its own national existence free from external interference, sabotage or coercion. The policy of intervention in the internal affairs of another country. Resolving differences or conflicts peacefully. Refusing the threat or use of force. Effective cooperation among Member States. Critical reception It can be seen that the context of the formation stages of the ASEAN Road Organization differs from the contemporary political reality. Meetings ASEAN summits  The meetings held by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are called ASEAN Summits. In such ASEAN summits, the heads of state of the member countries meet to discuss and resolve regional issues, and they also hold meetings with foreign leaders outside the ASEAN region and develop relations with foreign countries. The first official summit of ASEAN leaders was held in Bali, Indonesia in 1976. The third official summit of ASEAN was held in Manila, Philippines in 1987. At that conference, it was decided that the heads of government of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations would meet once every five years.[34] It was decided to hold ASEAN summits every three years after the fourth official summit held in Singapore in 1992 expressed willingness and agreement to meet more frequently.[34] Thereafter, in 2001, it was decided to meet annually to address pressing issues affecting the region. The member states agreed to hold the official summit in each country in alphabetical order of their name. But Burma lost its right to host an official ASEAN summit in 2006 due to pressure from the United States and the European Union in 2004.[35] After the entry into force of the ASEAN Charter in December 2008, ASEAN decided to hold an official summit twice a year. The ASEAN Official Summit will be held for three days. The regular procedures of the conference are as follows; The Heads of State of the Member States shall hold an intra-organizational meeting. The Heads of State of the Member States will hold a conference with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the ASEAN Regional Forum. A meeting called ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN Plus Three) will be held between the heads of state of the three negotiating partners of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations namely the People's Republic of China, Japan and South Korea. A separate meeting called ASEAN-CER will be held between the heads of state of Australia and New Zealand, the two negotiating partners of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  At the Fifth Official Summit in Bangkok it was decided that Heads of State would meet normally between each official summit:[34]  East Asia Official Summit  The East Asia Official Summit (EAS) is a pan-Asian organization convened annually by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and comprising 16 countries in East Asia and the region. The summit is being held to promote development in trade, energy and defense sectors and build regional unity. China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand are the member countries of this summit along with the 10 member countries of ASEAN. The combined population of these countries is roughly half of the world's population. In October 2010, Russia and the United States were formally invited to attend an official summit in 2011 with the presidents of both countries as full members.[36] The first official summit was held in Kuala Lumpur on 14 December 2005. Subsequent meetings were held after the ASEAN Leaders' Annual Meeting.  Memorial Summit A commemorative summit is a summit held by a non-ASEAN country to mark a milestone anniversary between ASEAN and a non-ASEAN country. The host country will invite the Heads of Government of ASEAN member countries to this conference to discuss future cooperation and partnership between them.  Regional organization  The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is a formal, official, multilateral organization operating in the Asia Pacific region. As of July 2007, 27 countries were members of this organization. The objectives of the ASEAN regional organization are to facilitate dialogue and consultation, build trust and practice precautionary diplomacy in the region.[41] The first meeting of the ASEAN Regional Organization was held in 1994. The current members of the organization are: ASEAN members, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Republic of China, European Union, India, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Russia, East Timor, United States of America and Sri Lanka. [42] Other meetings In addition to the above meetings other regular[43] meetings are also held.[44] These include the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting[45] and other smaller meetings.[46] These meetings are usually about security[43] or the environment[43][47] and are attended by ministers rather than heads of government. Three more ASEAN and Three is a forum jointly organized by the ASEAN member states, China, Japan and South Korea. It is held as a key event during every official ASEAN Summit. To date China, Japan and South Korea have not formed a Free Trade Area (FTA). A meeting on the creation of a Free Trade Area (FTA) was held in late 2012.[48] Asia-Europe meeting The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) was established in 1996 to strengthen cooperation between Asian and European countries. The meeting was initiated specifically to bring unity between the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).[49] The Secretary, one of the 45 ASEM partners, will attend on behalf of the ASEAN Federation. In addition, a representative of the ASEAN Federation will be appointed to the Governmental Committee at the meeting of the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF), a socio-cultural organization that will be held in conjunction with the meeting. ASEAN-Russia Summit The ASEAN-Russia Summit is an annual meeting between the leaders of the ASEAN member states and the President of Russia. ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting The 44th annual meeting of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting was held in Bali from 16 July 2011 to 23 July 2011. At the meeting, Indonesia proposed a unified ASEAN travel visa for citizens of ASEAN countries for intra-ASEAN travel.[50] The 45th Annual Meeting was held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. For the first time in ASEAN's history, a diplomatic statement was not issued by the organization at the end of the meeting due to disagreements with China and neighboring countries over the ownership of the South China Sea. Economic society Security, socio-cultural integration and economic integration are the main three pillars that underpin ASEAN's strong regional partnership.[51] The ASEAN member states came together to form the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015 to promote economic integration.[52] In the period from 1989 to 2009, the average economic growth of ASEAN countries was 6.73 percent for Singapore, 6.15 percent for Malaysia, 5.16 percent for Indonesia, 5.02 percent for Thailand, and 3.79 percent for the Philippines. This economic growth is higher than the Asia-Pacific Economic Association average economic growth of 2.83 percent.[53] The six main members of ASEAN The six major economies of ASEAN are called the six major economies, which have grown many times over the economies of other countries in the ASEAN.  Foreign direct investment ASEAN's foreign direct investment in 2009 was US$37.9 billion. It then doubled to US$75.8 billion in 2010. 22 percent of ASEAN's foreign direct investment comes from the EU. Next, 16 percent comes from ASEAN member countries, Japan and the United States. Inner ASEAN travel The number of intra-ASEAN trips increased rapidly due to the introduction of free visa service among ASEAN countries. Of the 73 million tourist arrivals from ASEAN member countries in 2010, 47 percent or 34 million tourists came from other Asian countries.[54] Intra-ASEAN trade As of the latter part of 2010, intra-ASEAN trade has been at a very low level. ASEAN member countries exported more to non-ASEAN countries. However, Laos exports 80 percent of its exports to ASEAN member countries and Myanmar 50 percent to other ASEAN member countries.[55] Charter  The ASEAN member states met in Jakarta, Indonesia on 15 December 2008 to implement the ASEAN Charter, signed in November 2007 with the aim of moving towards an EU-style community.[56] The ASEAN Charter made the ASEAN Federation a legal entity and aimed to create a free trade area in the region of 500 million people. Cultural activities In order to further integrate the ASEAN region, the ASEAN Federation undertakes various cultural activities. These include sports, educational activities and awards for writers. Some examples are ASEAN University Network, ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, ASEAN Scientist and Technologist Award, ASEAN Scholarship sponsored by Singapore. Education and Human Development Literacy rate Literacy generally refers to the ability to read, write, speak, listen and understand a language.[57] Six of the ASEAN countries have grown towards 100% by 2000. This literacy growth was attributed to the introduction of compulsory secondary education in the 1990s.[58][59]  Adult (15+) literacy rates are high in many countries. But the adult literacy rate of both countries is close to 90%. Little difference is observed in the literacy rate between males and females. The literacy rate between males and females is 14% in Cambodia and 19% in Laos.[60] Games Southeast Asian Games The Southeast Asian Games are commonly known as the SEA Games. It is held every two years and includes various sports. 11 countries from Southeast Asia are participating in these games. The Games are held under the constitution of the Southeast Asian Games Federation and under the supervision of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Asian Olympic Committee.

"Tamil Nadu is one of the 29 states of India. Tamil Nadu is also widely known as Tamil Nadu. Its capital is Chennai. Tamil Nadu is located at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. Its territorial boundaries are Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in the west and north. The state of Tamil Nadu has borders around the Puducherry and Karaikal regions of Puducherry Union Territory. It is geographically bounded by the Eastern Ghats to the north, the Western Ghats to the west by the Neelamalai escarpment, the Annai Mountain escarpment, and the Palakkad Pass, to the east by the Bay of Bengal, to the southeast by the Gulf of Mannar and the Straits of Baku, and to the south by the Indian Ocean. Tamil Nadu was known as Madras State in English and Chennai Province in Tamil. Protests were held to change it to Tamil Nadu. Sankaralinganar was resurrected after fasting for 76 days[11]. Later the name Madras State was changed to Tamil Nadu in 1969. Tamil Nadu is the 11th largest state in India by area and seventh largest in population. It is also the fourth largest contributor to India's GDP (as of 2010)[12]. In 2006 it was ranked tenth (sixteenth when including the United States) on the Human Development Index.[13] It is also the most urbanized state in India.[14] With 6% of India's population, it is the state with the highest number of commercial establishments (10.56%) and the second highest number of employment opportunities (9.97%)[15]. BC Tamils ​​have been living in this area since 500 BC. Tamil language inscriptions and literature dating back more than 20,000 years are available.[16]According to mythological tradition, Tamil is believed to have been taught to Agathiya by Lord Shiva.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . Tamil Nadu is rich in natural resources, temples inspired by Tamil architecture, hilltops, coastal resorts, places of worship of many religions; There are eight World Heritage Sites in Tamil Nadu.[25][26] Geography  Tamil Nadu is located in the southern coast of the Indian peninsula. In the north are the states of Karunadakam and Andhra, and in the west is Kerala. The Union Territory of Puducherry (formerly known as Pondicherry) is located on the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu. To the south-east of this state is the island of Sri Lanka. Unlike many other parts of the country, Tamil Nadu receives rainfall during the months of October – December from the ""Northeast monsoon"". During this period, the farmers depend heavily on the rains that come from the cyclones that form in the Bay of Bengal. Cauvery, the state's sixth major river, originates in Kodaku Hills in Karnataka state in the north and flows into Tamil Nadu. Vaigai, Tamiraparani and Palaru are other major rivers. Chennai, known as Madras until 1996, is the largest city and capital of the state of Tamil Nadu. Thirteen kilometers long and second longest beach in the world, Marina Beach is located in Chennai. Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, Salem, Thanjavur, Dindigul, Tirunelveli, Erode, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Tuticorin and Vellore are other major cities of Tamil Nadu. History   Tamil Nadu was ruled by Chera, Chola and Pandya kings in ancient times. Also, the state is an artistic region with many temples and sculptures. A song depicting the borders of Tamil Nadu Vada Vengadam South Kumari Aidai Tamil component Nallulagam Defines that (Tolkappiyam, special crop, 1-3). The land where the Tamil people used to live was called Tamil Nadu. The following literature references may be cited as proof of this: Tamil Nadu to listen to Vayaka (Purananuru, 168:18) Tamil Nadu is surrounded by this sea wall (Patiruppattu, II Patu, Pathikam: 5) To know Tamil Nadu in the drawing of Imil Sea (Silapathikaram, Arangerukatha: 38) (Manimegala, 17: 62) in Tamil Nadu Marungil within the island of Sambudh. Tamil Nadu has a history of more than 6000 years. There are various opinions about the origin of the Tamil people living here. Some believe that the Tamils, who once lived all over India, were a sub-group belonging to the extra-Indus civilization. The southward migration of this race is associated with the Aryan invasion policy. According to this policy, the Aryan invasion from the north is believed to have pushed the Tamils ​​into South India, which includes the present-day Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. Regardless of the historical facts, the identity of the modern Tamil people can be said to have been developed on the basis of the above principles.  The ancient Tamil Nadu, which included today's Tamil Nadu, was divided into various countries. Many royal dynasties came from time to time. The most prominent among them were the Pandyars, the Cheras, the Cholas, the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, the Vijayanagarats, and the Nayaks. The above-mentioned Madurai is located south of present-day Madurai and it is known through ancient Tamil literature that it was completely destroyed by an oceanic earthquake in later times. The Pandyan nation excelled in education and commerce. The people of Tamil Nadu had trade relations with the Greek and Roman empires of that time. Although subjugated from time to time by the Pallavas and the Cholas, the Pandyas were one of the most powerful royal dynasties in Tamil Nadu. 1st to 4th century AD Chera, Chola and Pandyar rulers of the Sangam era ruled Tamil Nadu from the first century AD to the fourth century. Among them, King Sengutuvan among the Cheras, King Karikal Cholan among the Cholas, and King Nedunjezhiyan among the Pandyas were famous rulers and became very famous. The Cheras were influential in present-day Kerala and Kongu districts, the Cholas in the areas that included Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli, and the Pandyas in Madurai, Nellai and South Kerala districts. It is believed that due to their alliance, Tamil Nadu excelled in their war operations against the rule of the Mauryan Gupta empires in the north. 4th to 9th century AD  AD In the early fourth century, unknown kings called Kalapraras ruled Tamil Nadu. Although their history is not known because they suppressed the Moovendras, the new kings of that time called the Pallavars were granted autonomy and only documents worth mentioning about them have been found. Historians say that the reign of these kings from 4th to 6th century AD is the dark period of Tamil Nadu. AD Later in the fourth century, the Pallavas came to the fore, building fine temples. They ruled South India for 400 years. They controlled most of the Tamil country with Kanchipuram as their capital. The Pallavas defeated the Cholas in the sixth century. It is believed that their influence extended to Sri Lanka. Mahendravarman I and his son Narasimhavarman were the best kings among the Pallavas. Pallavar architecture developed and evolved during the Pallavar period itself. The last Pallava king was Aparasidha. He was defeated by Adittha Chola in the latter part of the ninth century AD and the Pallavarakshi came to an end in Tamil Nadu. It is noteworthy that during this period (300 AD – 600 AD) the Buddha was very influential in Tamil Nadu.[27] 9th to 13th century  The Cholas came back to power in the ninth century AD. During the reign of Rajarasa Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas emerged as a powerful force in South India. Their empire extended to central India, Orissa, and even parts of Bengal.  Rajarasa Chola defeated the Chalukya kings and Chera kings in the east. He also conquered some parts of Sri Lanka from the Pandya kingdom. Rajendra Chola further advanced and captured the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakhsati Islands, Sumatra, Sava, Malaya and Pegu with his fleet. He also defeated Mahipalan who came from the present Bihar and Bengal regions. To celebrate his victory, he built a capital called Cholapuram on the banks of the Ganges. By the thirteenth century the power of the Cholas declined. 14th century After the fall of the Cholas in the 14th century, the Pandyas rose again. However, the upsurge did not last long. In 1316 the Khilsi rulers, invading from the north, besieged and plundered Madurai. The Muslim invasion rendered the Cholas and Pandyas powerless and gave rise to the Islamic ""Bamini"" rule. In response to the Islamic invasion, various small kingdoms came together to form the Visayanagara Empire. The various parts of the empire were divided and rulers called Nayaks were appointed to oversee them. The Visayas Empire, with Ambi as its capital, was prosperous and peaceful. However, the Visayanagara rulers were defeated by the Sultans of the Deccan plateau in the Battle of Talikota around 1564 and all the territories under their control were divided among the Nayaks. During Nayak's rule, Pattana Palayams were formed to reform the political systems of Tamil Nadu and the system of village self-government was abolished. Nayaks from Tanjore and Madurai rose to fame and renovated ancient temples. Present-day Kerala and the adjoining areas of Malabar were under the rule of Chera. The territory of the Cheras bordering the sea was open to trade with the Romans. Until the British invasion, the small area under Cheras rule remained largely uninvaded. 17th century A new chapter in the political history of Tamil Nadu began after the British established the East India Company in Madras (now known as Chennai) in 1639. They took advantage of the quarrels among the petty princes of Tamil Nadu to divide them and started exerting their power over them. Tamil Nadu and subsequently South India gradually came under British control. There were also many Tamil rulers who fought against the British during this period of their domination. Rulers like Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Ananda Padmanabha Nadar, Pulithevan, Velu Nachiyar, Maruthu brothers, Vandayat Devan, Akku Muthukkon, Veeran Sundharalingam, Ondi Veeran, Periya Kaladi, Theeran Chinnamalai led the forces to fight against the whites. 20th century  When India gained independence in 1947, the Madras Province (pictured) became the Madras State. But till 1948 Pudukottai princely state was under the rule of Thondaiman kings. It is one of the last remaining princely states of India. Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, West Kerala, South West Karnataka coastal areas came under Madras State. In 1953, the Telugu-speaking northern parts of Madras State were further divided into Andhra State and the Tamil-speaking southern parts into Madras State. In 1956, the western coastal areas of Madras State were divided between Kerala and Karnataka through an amendment to redefine state boundaries. In 1969, Madras State was renamed as Tamil Nadu. Kanyakumari District, a Tamil-speaking area in the southern part of Travancore-Cochin state, was formed and merged with Tamil Nadu on November 1, 1956. tradition Tamil Nadu is known for its rich literary, musical and dance traditions that continue to flourish today. It is one of the most industrialized states in India. Subramania Bharati, V. U. Chidambarampillai, C. V.

Politics  The number of legislative constituencies in Tamil Nadu is 234. The number of parliamentary constituencies is 39. Until 1986, Tamil Nadu had a two-tier legislature. Currently there is only one. Municipal Corporations, Municipalities, Boroughs and Panchayats are also elected once in five years to elect their representatives. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam are the main political parties in Tamil Nadu. (Kongun Nadu People's National Party), Indian National Congress, Republican Party of India, All India Forward Bloc, Indian Commonwealth Party (Marxist), Patali People's Party, Revival Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Liberation Tigers National Progressive Dravida Kazhagam, Bharatiya Janata Party, Humanist People's Party , New Tamil Nadu Party, Moovender Munnetra Kazhagam, Muslim League, All India Equality People's Party and Naam Tamil Party are significant parties. Periyar broke away from the Dravida Kazhagam founded in 1916 and formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in 1949. N. He created Annadurai. After India's independence in 1947, Tamil Nadu was ruled by the Indian National Congress until 1967. In 1967 Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam formed the government. In 1972 he broke away from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and formed the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Co. Created by Ramachandran. In 1977 Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam first came to power. From 1967 till the last assembly election in 2016 DMK or A.E.A.D.M.G. One of the two parties or coalitions led by them are winning majority of seats. Although many parties are contesting in Tamilnadu assembly elections, single-party rule is taking place so far. DMK for the first time Served as an absolute minority government (2006–2011). However, Tamil Nadu parties are influential in the middle government and help form coalition governments and participate. Districts   There are currently 33 districts in Tamil Nadu. Districts are often named after the capitals of the districts. Exceptions to this are Nagercoil, the capital of Kanyakumari district, and Utakamandal, the capital of Neelamalai district. The existing districts have been renamed in different ways at different times. In some periods, the names of Tamil Nadu chieftains who have passed away with the names of the districts were called. Now the names have been removed and only the names of the districts remain. There are 288 revenue circles in these 33 districts.

Popular high art forms such as Bharata dance, Carnatic music and Dravidian architecture mostly developed and specialized in Tamil Nadu. Language and Literature  The official language of Tamil Nadu is Tamil. English is also used as official language. Tamil is the first language recognized as an official language of India. Tamil language occupies a very important place in the culture of Tamils. All the oldest literatures of Tamil known as Sangha literatures are written in Seyul form. Since ancient times Tamil is the language that has found grammar not only in literature but also in people's lives. Tirukkural is the best book of Tamil. It has also been translated into various languages ​​of the world. This book is written by a great Tamil writer who does not identify himself as such. Thirukkural is hailed as the world's common secret because it preaches common justice to all the people of the world regardless of country, language and race. Cadil Viluchelvam education for one Other than the model (Screw 400)  From the literature of Tamil we can know the elements like the best culture and lifestyle of the Tamil people of that time. India's first books were printed in Tamil. The first printing press in Tamil Nadu was established by the Portuguese in 1578 at Punnaikaial.[40] Later, a large number of Tamil literatures were printed in Tharangambadi Printing House and in Chennai. The poems of Tamil poets such as Bharatiyar and Bharathidasan were helpful in rousing the liberation sentiments of the people in the Indian Liberation War. Nowadays Tamil poets like Vali, Vairamuthu, Tamarai are composing poetry. Novels, short stories and long stories are published by Tamil writers. Transportation  Transport in Tamil Nadu has been developed by connecting small villages through road transport, most cities through rail transport and major cities through air transport. Festivals  Pongal Thirunal (also known as Tamil Thirunal or Plowmen's Thirunal) is the main festival celebrated by Tamils. This three-day festival is celebrated on the first day (January 14 or 15) of the Tamil month of Tai. Eid al-Adha, Bakrit, Mukkaram Islamic New Year Apart from Pongal, religious festivals like Diwali, Thaipusam, Vinayagar Chaturthi, Saraswati (God of Education) Puja, Ayudha Pusai, Christmas, Good Friday, Uchikondattamam Tamil New Year Thirunal (first day of Chitrai month - April 13 or 14) and English New Year celebrations are also held.  Tourism  Tamil Nadu is a prime tourism state with beautiful landscapes and heritage sites. Tamil Nadu is famous for its temples reflecting the Dravidian style of architecture. Awe-inspiring gopurams and chariots add to the beauty of these temples.Ramanathapuram District Rameswaram Ramanathaswamy Temple's third prakaram is the largest in the world.

"right | thumb | Hammer and Feather Experiment - When Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott recreated Galileo's famous gravity experiment on the moon. (1.38 MB, Ag / Theora format) Gravitational force or material gravitation or geogravity is the force with which objects naturally attract each other and is directly proportional to the multiplication of their masses. Gravity is what causes objects to fall and gives them weight when they are dropped. Gravitational force is the force acting between any two objects in the universe. This force is the gravitational force that depends on the masses of objects. Among the fundamental forces, gravity is the weakest force. But it can operate over long distances in space. It is also referred to as 'gravitational force'. Gravitational force helps separate things to come together and things that come together stay together. It thus contributes to the existence of the Earth, the Sun, and the vast array of materials in the universe. to orbit the Earth and other planets; For the moon to revolve around the earth; For the formation of waves; for fluid flow depending on its density change rate and gravity; To generate more heat inside the forming stars and planets; And the force of gravity is also responsible for the location of various phenomena on Earth. Gravitational force, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force are the four fundamental forces of nature. Modern physics explains gravity, the motion of all motionless objects, through Einstein's theory of general relativity. Newton's simple law of universal gravitation gives an accurate approximation at very high altitudes. History of Gravitational Theory  Scientific revolution Contemporary work on the theory of gravitation was begun by Galileo Galilei in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In his famous (though unproven [1]) experiment, by dropping balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and then carefully measuring the balls on inclines, Galileo showed that gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate. This changed Aristotle's principle that heavier objects had faster growth.[2] It is acknowledged that Galileo was right that lighter objects fall more slowly through the atmosphere due to air resistance. Galileo's work helped develop Newton's theory of gravity. Newton's Theory of Gravitation  In 1687, English mathematician Sir Isaac Newton published the inverse square law of universal gravitation in the scientific journal Principia. In his own words, he found that ""the force which causes the planets to revolve in their orbits is the negative of their radius."" And he applied this concept to the Moon and the Earth, and found them to be roughly coincident. Newton's theory found its greatest success when it was used to discover the existence of Neptune based on the movements of Uranus. It cannot be known through the actions of other planets. John Couch Adams (John Couch Adams) and Urbain Le Verrier (Urbain Le Verrier) predicted the general position of the planet, and according to Le Verrier's calculation, Johann Gottfried Galle discovered Neptune. An anomaly in Mercury's orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the slight perturbation in its orbit could not be fully accounted for under Newton's theory, but all searches for another planet (one that orbits closer to the Sun than Mercury) proved fruitless. In 1915 this problem was solved by Albert Einstein's new general theory of relativity which accounted for small anomalies in Mercury's orbit. Although Newton's theory has been deprecated, modern calculations of relativistic gravity are made using Newton's theory, which is simpler than general relativity, and gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving masses, velocities, and energies that are sufficiently small. According to Newton's law of gravitation, the force of gravity is directly proportional to the product of masses and inversely proportional to twice the distance between them. That is, if m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects and r is the distance between them, the gravitational force between the two objects is      F = G     m  1    m  2     r  2       {\displaystyle F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}}   G is the gravitational constant. Its value is 6.67 x 10−11 N m2 kg−2. According to the SI unit system, the unit of mass is kilogram (kg) and the unit of distance is meter (m) and the unit of force is newton (N). Equality theory The Equilibrium Theory, developed by successive researchers including Galileo, Loránd Eötvös, and Einstein, postulated that all objects fall uniformly. The simplest way to test the theory of weak equilibrium is to leave two objects of different mass or composition in a vacuum and see if they fall to the ground at the same time. These experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when friction (including air resistance) is negligible. More modern experiments used a torsion balance of a type invented by Eötvös. Satellite experiments, such as the Step-satellite, are planned for precise experiments in space. Equilibrium theory formulations are as follows: Theory of Weak Equilibrium: The tendency of a point mass in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity, and not on its position. Einsteinian Equilibrium Theory:. The result of any non-gravitational experiment in a free-fall laboratory does not depend on the duration, location and speed of the laboratory. Strong equilibrium theory requires both of the above. General relativity   In general relativity, the effects of gravity occur through the curvature of spacetime instead of force. The starting point of general relativity is the equating of inertial motion and free fall, and the equilibrium theory explains that objects falling freely do not accelerate in analogy to observers accelerating on the ground. In Newtonian physics, such acceleration does not occur unless objects are acted upon by at least one force. Einstein said that matter bends space-time, and free-falling matter follows straight paths in curved space-time. These straight lines are called the Earth's surface lines. Like Newton's first law of motion, Einstein's theory states that when a force is applied to an object, it deviates from a plane. For example, we do not follow the Earth's surfaces when we stand unfrozen on the ground. Because the Earth's mechanical resistance exerts a force on us. This explains why the Earth's surfaces move through time and are considered stationary. Einstein discovered the field equations in relativity when he related the existence of vortices and the curvature of spacetime, hence his name. Einstein's field equations are a set of 10 simultaneous, nonlinear, differential equations. The solutions of the field equations are the metric tensor components of spacetime. A superfluity describes the geometry of spacetime. The trajectories of a space-time spherical surface are calculated by superfluity. Notable solutions of Einstein's field equations are: The Schwarzschild solution describes the space-time surrounding a spherically symmetric rotating uncharged mass. For small amounts of material, this solution produced a black spot with a central singularity. The acceleration at distances greater than the Schwarzschild radius is equal to that predicted by Newton's theory of gravity. In the Reissner-Nordström solution the central substance has a charge. Kerr's Solution: An explanation for rotating objects. This solution produces black holes at multiple event boundaries. Kerr-Neumann Solution: For charged, rotating objects. This solution produces multiple event boundaries for black holes. Cosmology Friedman-Lamaître-Robertson, Walker's solution to the expansion of the universe Predicted experiments of general relativity. s include the following: General relativity accounts for Mercury's paradoxical diminution. The time-slow prediction can be done using the Pound-Rebekah test, Habile-Keating test, and G.P. Confirmed by s. The diffraction of light was first confirmed by Arthur Stanley Ettington through his observations during a solar eclipse on May 29, 1919. Ettington measured starlight deviations twice, consistent with the predictions of general relativity and the predictions of Newton's particle principle. However, his interpretation of the results was later disputed. Recent experiments using radio interferometric measurements of quasars passing behind the Sun have confirmed the deviation of light to a level more precisely than that predicted by the theory of general relativity. Also see gravitational lens. Irwin I Shapiro in 1964 identified the time delay of light when a large object passes close by through interplanetary space signals. Gravitational radiation has been indirectly confirmed by observations of binary pulsars. In 1922 Alexander Friedman discovered that Einstein's equations have unstable solutions (even in the presence of the cosmological constant). In 1927, Georges Lemaitre showed that Einstein's equations were unstable in the presence of the cosmological constant, and that Einstein's postulated stable universe could not exist. Later, in 1931, Einstein agreed with Friedman and Lemaitre's conclusions. Thus the general relativity theory is unstable and is predicted to either expand or contract. In 1929, Edwin Hubble confirmed the expansion of the universe. The prediction of the law of attraction theory was recently consistent with the gravity study B conclusion. General relativity predicts that light will lose energy as it travels from heavier objects. Radek Wojtak's team at the Niels Bohr College at the University of Copenhagen used data from 8000 cluster regions to show that light waves from the center of clusters are redshifted more than from the edges, and power is reduced by gravity. Gravity and Quantum Mechanics Decades after the discovery of general relativity, general relativity was also felt to be incompatible with quantum mechanics. As with other fundamental forces within the framework of quantum field theory, it can be described as the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force, where the force is due to the exchange of gravitation. It reproduced general relativity in the classical limit. However, this approach is not accessible at short lengths of plank length. A complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum mechanics) is needed. specific ones Earth's gravity Each planetary system (including Earth) is surrounded by its own gravitational field. It exerts an attractive force on all objects. Assuming a spherically symmetric planet, the strength of its field at any point is directly proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the distance of that point from the center of the body. Gravitational force is equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence and on the surface of the Earth, its value is expressed as g below a nearly constant mean. g = 9,81 M / s 2 = 32.2 ft / s 2 Neglecting air resistance, this means that when an object falls freely near the surface of the Earth, its speed increases by 9.81 M/s (32.2 ft/s or 22 mph). That is, an object starting from rest reaches a velocity of 9.81 M/s (32.2 ft/s) in one second, 19.62 M/s (64.4 ft/s) two seconds later, and every 9.81M/s ( 32.2 ft/s) and get its speed. Also, in the absence of air resistance, all objects falling from the same height will hit the ground at the same time.  According to Newton's 3rd law, the force exerted by the earth on an object falling on it is the same but in the opposite direction to the direction it is exerted. This means that the Earth is accelerated towards the object until the object collides with the Earth. Since the mass of the Earth is greater, the acceleration imparted to the Earth by this counterforce is negligible compared to the object. If the object does not bounce back after hitting the Earth, the two have exerted a light force on each other. It balances the object's gravity and stops further acceleration. Equations of objects falling near the Earth's surface  Under constant gravity, Newton's law of universal gravitation simplifies to F = mg, where m is the mass of the mass and g is a constant vector with mean magnitude of 9 .81 M / s 2 . The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this g. The distance traveled by an object falling freely from an initially stationary position under gravity decreases in direct proportion to the square of its time. The image on the right was captured with a stroboscopic flash at a rate of 20 flashes per second over a half second period.The ball has traveled a unit distance in a fraction of 20 seconds; (where a unit is 12 mm); A distance of 4 units in two fractions of time; A distance of 9 units was covered in 3 seconds. Under the assumption of uniform gravity the mass energy of an object at a height h is E= mgh (or E = Wh, where W is the weight.) This equation is valid only at small distances h from the Earth's surface. Similarly,    h =     v  2    2 g       {\displaystyle h={\tfrac {v^{2}}{2g}}}  The equation for the maximum height of an object thrown vertically is applicable only for small speeds and small distances. Gravity and Astronomy Newton's law of gravitation provides detailed information about the planets in our solar system, the mass of the Sun, distances to stars, quasars, and dark matter. Although we have not traveled to all the planets or the sun, we know their weight. This weight is measured by applying the laws of gravity to the properties of the orbit. An object in space maintains its orbit because the force of gravity acts on it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit the center of a galaxy, galaxies orbit its center of mass, and clusters orbit a supercluster. The gravitational force exerted by one object on another is directly proportional to the weight of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Gravitational radiation General relativity created an oscillating situation, such as the curvature of gravitational radiation space-time containing objects with parallel orbits. The gravitational radiation emitted by the solar system is too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation in binary pulsar systems PSR B1913 +16 has been indirectly detected as an energy loss over time. Neutron star accretion and black hole formation are believed to produce detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories like LIGO are studying the problem. No definitive detections have been made with this hypothetical radioactivity, but the science behind LIGO has been refined and given the instruments greater sensitivity over the next decade. . Problems and Contradictions There are some observations, which point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps explain them in other ways, that are not adequately accounted for.  Fast-moving stars: The velocities of the stars are widely distributed so that the outermost stars in the galaxies are moving faster. The constellations at Kluchtare showed the same pattern. It is paradoxical that dark matter interacts gravitationally rather than electromagnetically. Various modifications of Newtonian mechanics have also been proposed. Irregularity of missions: Various spacecraft have experienced higher than expected accelerations when assisted by gravitational maneuvers. Expansion Accelerator: The exponential expansion of space appears faster. Dark energy has been proposed to explain this. Anomalous increase in astronomical unit: Recent measurements show that the orbits of the planets are rapidly expanding as the Sun's weight decreases by releasing energy. Photons with extra energy: Photons travel through the region of the cluster to gain general energy and then lose it again along the way. The accelerating expansion of the universe must stop the photons sending energy back. This may indicate that gravity decays faster at certain distance scales than the negative square law. Dark Stream: Studies of the motion of the universe have discovered the existence of a mysterious dark stream towards the invisible mass. Such a large mass accumulation is very large because current models using Big Bang show that gravity decreases more slowly than the inverse-square of certain distance scales. Hydrogen clouds with extra mass: The spectral lines of the Lyman-alpha forest indicate that hydrogen clouds become thicker with certain expected magnitudes and, like the dark stream, that gravity falls off more slowly than the inverse-square of magnitudes off certain distances.

"The Saqqara or Sahara Desert (Arabic: الصحراء القبرة) is the world's largest hot desert located in northern Africa. The Sahara desert is the second largest desert after Antarctica. Its area is 9,000,000 square kilometers (3,500,000 sq mi). This area is roughly the size of the United States of America. The desert covers most of North Africa, with the exception of fertile areas along the Mediterranean coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, Egypt, and the Nile River Valley in Sudan. Stretching from the Red Sea to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, its terrain gradually changes from desert to coastal plain towards the coast. In the south, it surrounds Pattaya, a semi-desert tropical savanna near the Nile River Valley and the hottest part of sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions such as the Western Sahara, the Middle Ahagar Mountains, the Thibestic Mountains, the Air Mountains, the Tenere Desert, and the Libyan Desert. This desert is approximately 2.5 million years old. Before that there were lakes and rivers here. The desert starts at the Red Sea and connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the sand dunes here are almost 180m (590 ft) high. Although the name Sahara is commonly given, it derives from the Arabic word for desert, ساحرا (صحراء). Geology The Sahara Desert is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Red Sea to the east, and Sudan to the south. The Sahara desert is spread over twelve countries: Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Eritrea, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The peninsula begins at the Red Sea and connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The Sahara Desert covers an area of ​​9 million square kilometers (3,500,000 sq mi). Although it is 31 percent of Africa, this area varies from time to time. If all areas with an average annual rainfall of less than 250 mm were included in the Sahara Desert, the Sahara would cover 11 million square kilometers (4,200,000 sq mi). Many deep-scattered mountains, and many volcanoes, rise from this desert, notably the Ahar Mountains, the Ahagar Mountains, the Saharan Atlas, the Thibestic Mountains, the Adrar des Iforas, the Red Sea Mountains, etc. The highest peak in the Sahara is Emi Kusesi, a shield volcano. The Sahara is the largest desert in the African continent. The southern border of the Sahara is the Sahel savannah. South of the Sakhalin lies the country of South Sudan and the Congo Basin. Most of the Sahara consists of bedrock; Only a small area covered by sand dunes is covered. Humans lived on the edge of the Sahara desert during the last ice age thousands of years ago. Fossils of crocodiles and more than 30,000 other aquatic animals have been found in southeastern Algeria at the time of the Sahara. Nowhere in the modern Sahara except the Nile Valley was green. Mediterranean plants such as the citoon tree were present. This was the case till 1600 BC. After the earth's axis shifted and temperature changes took place in what is now the Sahara, it became a sandy desert. Mid-Saharan is a mixed terrain with sporadic vegetation. The northern and southern desert regions are mountainous, with scattered grasslands and desert shrublands, trees and tall shrubs. In the Middle Sahara, the mixed desert region, there are several sub-divisions of the Great Desert: Tansuruf, Tenere, Libyan Desert, Eastern Desert, Nubian Desert and others. It is a very dry region with no frequent rains for many years. Northern Sahara consists of parts of the Mediterranean Sea and Libya in Egypt. It encompasses the Mediterranean Forest, Woodland, and North African ecoregions, all of which have a Mediterranean climate with hot summers and cold, rainy winters. The northern reaches receive about 100 millimeters (3.9 in) of annual rainfall. [1] On a seasonal scale, the southern border of the Sahara receives about 150 mm (5.9 in) of annual precipitation (this is a long-term average measurement, as precipitation varies from year to year). [1]   Major cities located in the Sahara are Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, Tamanrazet in Algeria, Orkula, Becher, Hassi Mesouth, Qardaya, El Oyoud; Timbuktu in Mali; Agadez in Niger; God in Libya; Tins like FIA-Larkov in Saad city. Environment After the last ice age, the Sahara desert became a fertile place. Historical evidence suggests that it gradually turned into a desert again. Researchers say that the Sahara has undergone many environmental changes in the past hundred years. Such changes occur as the Earth tilts from 22o to 24.5o every 41000 years. And the researchers say that after 15000 (17000 A.D) years the Sahara will become a green place. It is the hottest part of the world. But researchers say it is not a dry region. The Sahara desert also has the highest mountains. Some of these mountains are covered with snow even in summer[2][3]. 2500 meters of snow falls every seven years in Tibesti mountains. On some mountains the snow melts within minutes[4]. The most important mountain ranges are in the Algerian regions. Egypt also has areas that are 130 meters below sea level. About 25% of the Sahara is covered by sand [2]. Many rivers flow through the Sahara. But they flow only for certain periods. The Niger River and the Nile River are perennial rivers that flow into the Sahara. Severe sandstorms also blow in the Sahara. Winds are strong in western Algeria[5][6]. Iron ores are also available here. Uranium is abundant in some places, oil in Algeria and phosphate minerals in Western Sahara. Plants and animals Many parts of the Sahara are uninhabitable for humans and animals. But humans and animals live in some places where there is water[7].  Indian camels and goats are the most common animals in the Sahara. Adapted to live in the milky land, camels are loved by the nomads here. Palatine yellow scorpion is found here. It grows up to 10 cm in length. This plant is very poisonous. However, adult humans rarely die from stinging. Many species of foxes are also found here. A large white crab known as Ataxu is found here. It can withstand long days without water. Also small deer called Thorkasu, Rim and Tama are also found. These too can survive for long days without water. Sahara leopards are found in Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali etc. There are also small African wild dogs. Lizards, sand vulture, fire fowl etc. are other animals found here. Silver ants are also found here. It lives in burrows underground. They die if left outside for more than an hour. They feed on organisms that die due to heat. History Nubian  In the Neolithic period, i.e. B.C. Before desertification began around 9500, the climate here provided enough food for the people who lived in central Sudan.

"Tamil Nadu is one of the 29 states of India. Tamil Nadu is also widely known as Tamil Nadu. Its capital is Chennai. Tamil Nadu is located at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. Its territorial boundaries are Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in the west and north. The state of Tamil Nadu has borders around the Puducherry and Karaikal regions of Puducherry Union Territory. It is geographically bounded by the Eastern Ghats to the north, the Western Ghats to the west by the Neelamalai escarpment, the Annai Mountain escarpment, and the Palakkad Pass, to the east by the Bay of Bengal, to the southeast by the Gulf of Mannar and the Straits of Baku, and to the south by the Indian Ocean. Tamil Nadu was known as Madras State in English and Chennai Province in Tamil. Protests were held to change it to Tamil Nadu. Sankaralinganar was resurrected after fasting for 76 days[11]. Later the name Madras State was changed to Tamil Nadu in 1969. Tamil Nadu is the 11th largest state in India by area and seventh largest in population. It is also the fourth largest contributor to India's GDP (as of 2010)[12]. In 2006 it was ranked tenth (sixteenth when including the United States) on the Human Development Index.[13] It is also the most urbanized state in India.[14] With 6% of India's population, it is the state with the highest number of commercial establishments (10.56%) and the second highest number of employment opportunities (9.97%)[15]. BC Tamils ​​have been living in this area since 500 BC. Tamil language inscriptions and literature dating back more than 20,000 years are available.[16]According to mythological tradition, Tamil is believed to have been taught to Agathiya by Lord Shiva.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . Tamil Nadu is rich in natural resources, temples inspired by Tamil architecture, hilltops, coastal resorts, places of worship of many religions; There are eight World Heritage Sites in Tamil Nadu.[25][26] Geography  Tamil Nadu is located in the southern coast of the Indian peninsula. In the north are the states of Karunadakam and Andhra, and in the west is Kerala. The Union Territory of Puducherry (formerly known as Pondicherry) is located on the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu. To the south-east of this state is the island of Sri Lanka. Unlike many other parts of the country, Tamil Nadu receives rainfall during the months of October – December from the ""Northeast monsoon"". During this period, the farmers depend heavily on the rains that come from the cyclones that form in the Bay of Bengal. Cauvery, the state's sixth major river, originates in Kodaku Hills in Karnataka state in the north and flows into Tamil Nadu. Vaigai, Tamiraparani and Palaru are other major rivers. Chennai, known as Madras until 1996, is the largest city and capital of the state of Tamil Nadu. Thirteen kilometers long and second longest beach in the world, Marina Beach is located in Chennai. Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, Salem, Thanjavur, Dindigul, Tirunelveli, Erode, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Tuticorin and Vellore are other major cities of Tamil Nadu. History   Tamil Nadu was ruled by Chera, Chola and Pandya kings in ancient times. Also, the state is an artistic region with many temples and sculptures. A song depicting the borders of Tamil Nadu Vada Vengadam South Kumari Aidai Tamil component Nallulagam Defines that (Tolkappiyam, special crop, 1-3). The land where the Tamil people used to live was called Tamil Nadu. The following literature references may be cited as proof of this: Tamil Nadu to listen to Vayaka (Purananuru, 168:18) Tamil Nadu is surrounded by this sea wall (Patiruppattu, II Patu, Pathikam: 5) To know Tamil Nadu in the drawing of Imil Sea (Silapathikaram, Arangerukatha: 38) (Manimegala, 17: 62) in Tamil Nadu Marungil within the island of Sambudh. Tamil Nadu has a history of more than 6000 years. There are various opinions about the origin of the Tamil people living here. Some believe that the Tamils, who once lived all over India, were a sub-group belonging to the extra-Indus civilization. The southward migration of this race is associated with the Aryan invasion policy. According to this policy, the Aryan invasion from the north is believed to have pushed the Tamils ​​into South India, which includes the present-day Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. Regardless of the historical facts, the identity of the modern Tamil people can be said to have been developed on the basis of the above principles.  The ancient Tamil Nadu, which included today's Tamil Nadu, was divided into various countries. Many royal dynasties came from time to time. The most prominent among them were the Pandyars, the Cheras, the Cholas, the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, the Vijayanagarats, and the Nayaks. The above-mentioned Madurai is located south of present-day Madurai and it is known through ancient Tamil literature that it was completely destroyed by an oceanic earthquake in later times. The Pandyan nation excelled in education and commerce. The people of Tamil Nadu had trade relations with the Greek and Roman empires of that time. Although subjugated from time to time by the Pallavas and the Cholas, the Pandyas were one of the most powerful royal dynasties in Tamil Nadu. 1st to 4th century AD Chera, Chola and Pandyar rulers of the Sangam era ruled Tamil Nadu from the first century AD to the fourth century. Among them, King Sengutuvan among the Cheras, King Karikal Cholan among the Cholas, and King Nedunjezhiyan among the Pandyas were famous rulers and became very famous. The Cheras were influential in present-day Kerala and Kongu districts, the Cholas in the areas that included Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli, and the Pandyas in Madurai, Nellai and South Kerala districts. It is believed that due to their alliance, Tamil Nadu excelled in their war operations against the rule of the Mauryan Gupta empires in the north. 4th to 9th century AD  AD In the early fourth century, unknown kings called Kalapraras ruled Tamil Nadu. Although their history is not known because they suppressed the Moovendras, the new kings of that time called the Pallavars were granted autonomy and only documents worth mentioning about them have been found. Historians say that the reign of these kings from 4th to 6th century AD is the dark period of Tamil Nadu. AD Later in the fourth century, the Pallavas came to the fore, building fine temples. They ruled South India for 400 years. They controlled most of the Tamil country with Kanchipuram as their capital. The Pallavas defeated the Cholas in the sixth century. It is believed that their influence extended to Sri Lanka. Mahendravarman I and his son Narasimhavarman were the best kings among the Pallavas. Pallavar architecture developed and evolved during the Pallavar period itself. The last Pallava king was Aparasidha. He was defeated by Adittha Chola in the latter part of the ninth century AD and the Pallavarakshi came to an end in Tamil Nadu. It is noteworthy that during this period (300 AD – 600 AD) the Buddha was very influential in Tamil Nadu.[27] 9th to 13th century  The Cholas came back to power in the ninth century AD. During the reign of Rajarasa Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas emerged as a powerful force in South India. Their empire extended to central India, Orissa, and even parts of Bengal.  Rajarasa Chola defeated the Chalukya kings and Chera kings in the east. He also conquered some parts of Sri Lanka from the Pandya kingdom. Rajendra Chola further advanced and captured the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakhsati Islands, Sumatra, Sava, Malaya and Pegu with his fleet. He also defeated Mahipalan who came from the present Bihar and Bengal regions. To celebrate his victory, he built a capital called Cholapuram on the banks of the Ganges. By the thirteenth century the power of the Cholas declined. 14th century After the fall of the Cholas in the 14th century, the Pandyas rose again. However, the upsurge did not last long. In 1316 the Khilsi rulers, invading from the north, besieged and plundered Madurai. The Muslim invasion rendered the Cholas and Pandyas powerless and gave rise to the Islamic ""Bamini"" rule. In response to the Islamic invasion, various small kingdoms came together to form the Visayanagara Empire. The various parts of the empire were divided and rulers called Nayaks were appointed to oversee them. The Visayas Empire, with Ambi as its capital, was prosperous and peaceful. However, the Visayanagara rulers were defeated by the Sultans of the Deccan plateau in the Battle of Talikota around 1564 and all the territories under their control were divided among the Nayaks. During Nayak's rule, Pattana Palayams were formed to reform the political systems of Tamil Nadu and the system of village self-government was abolished. Nayaks from Tanjore and Madurai rose to fame and renovated ancient temples. Present-day Kerala and the adjoining areas of Malabar were under the rule of Chera. The territory of the Cheras bordering the sea was open to trade with the Romans. Until the British invasion, the small area under Cheras rule remained largely uninvaded. 17th century A new chapter in the political history of Tamil Nadu began after the British established the East India Company in Madras (now known as Chennai) in 1639. They took advantage of the quarrels among the petty princes of Tamil Nadu to divide them and started exerting their power over them. Tamil Nadu and subsequently South India gradually came under British control. There were also many Tamil rulers who fought against the British during this period of their domination. Rulers like Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Ananda Padmanabha Nadar, Pulithevan, Velu Nachiyar, Maruthu brothers, Vandayat Devan, Akku Muthukkon, Veeran Sundharalingam, Ondi Veeran, Periya Kaladi, Theeran Chinnamalai led the forces to fight against the whites. 20th century  When India gained independence in 1947, the Madras Province (pictured) became the Madras State. But till 1948 Pudukottai princely state was under the rule of Thondaiman kings. It is one of the last remaining princely states of India. Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, West Kerala, South West Karnataka coastal areas came under Madras State. In 1953, the Telugu-speaking northern parts of Madras State were further divided into Andhra State and the Tamil-speaking southern parts into Madras State. In 1956, the western coastal areas of Madras State were divided between Kerala and Karnataka through an amendment to redefine state boundaries. In 1969, Madras State was renamed as Tamil Nadu. Kanyakumari District, a Tamil-speaking area in the southern part of Travancore-Cochin state, was formed and merged with Tamil Nadu on November 1, 1956. tradition Tamil Nadu is known for its rich literary, musical and dance traditions that continue to flourish today.

"Bangalore (Kannada: बंगालूर) is the capital of the state of Karnataka. Located in the south-eastern part of Karnataka on the Deccan Plateau, it is the third most populous city in India[1] and the fifth largest in terms of urban population density. Many consider the city's modern history to begin in 1537, when Kempe Gowda, considered by many to be the first architect of modern Bangalore, built a brick-and-mortar fort on the site and established it as a region of the Vijayanagara Empire. During the British rule, it became the center of colonial rule in South India. Today, Bengaluru is a major developing metropolis, home to many of India's most prestigious colleges and research institutes. A large number of public sector heavy industries, software companies, aerospace, telecommunications, and defense sector companies are located in the city. Bengaluru is known as the 'Silicon Valley' of India due to its proud position as the country's leader in IT employment and exports.[2] With its diverse population, Bengaluru is a major economic hub and one of the fastest growing cities in India. In 2015, the name was changed to Bengaluru.[3] Name history The name Bangalore, which is an anglicization of the city name Bangalore, was used until a few years ago. The earliest reference to the name ""Bangalore"" is found in inscriptions carved on a ninth-century Western Ganga dynasty ""Veerak Kal"" (stone inscriptions extolling the merits of a hero). In this inscription found at Begar, ""Bangalore"" is mentioned as a place where the battle took place in 890 AD. This place was a part of the Ganga empire. It was called Bengaval-uru, meaning ""City of Guards"" in Halegannada (Old Kannada).[4] An article in The Hindu says: [5] An inscription dating back to 890 AD shows that Bangalore is more than 1,000 years old. But this inscription lies unattended in the Parvati Nageswara temple at Bekur near the city...Written in Hale Kannada (Old Kannada) language, this inscription refers to the Battle of Bengaluru in 890 AD. Although it was recorded by the historian R. Narasimhachar in his Compendium of Carnatic Petroglyphs (Vol. 10 Supplement), no efforts have been made to preserve it. An old story, famous even if anecdotal, recalls: The Hoysala king of the 11th century Viravalala II, while out hunting, forgot his way through the forest. While hungry and tired, he met a poor old woman. The old lady served him some unripe rice. The king gratefully named the place ""Benda-kal-uru"" (Kannada: Bendakalur) (literally, ""city of unripe beans""). It eventually became ""Bangalore"".[6][7] On 11 December 2005, Jnana Peetha awardee U.R. was appointed to change the name Bangalore to Bengaluru. The Karnataka government announced that it had accepted an idea presented by Ananthamurthy.[8] On 27 September 2006, the Purugath Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) passed a resolution to implement the proposed name change.[9] The decision was accepted by the Government of Karnataka and the name change was officially implemented on November 1, 2006.[10][11] However, the process was somewhat stalled due to delays in getting approval from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.[12] History  After hundreds of years of rule by the Upper Gangars, Bengaluru was captured by the Cholas in 1024 AD and then fell to the Chalukya-Cholas in 1070 AD. In 1116, the Hoysala Empire overthrew the Cholas and extended its rule to Bangalore. Modern Bengaluru was founded by Kempe Gowda I, one of the tenants of the Vijayanagara Empire. He built a brick-and-mortar fort and a Nandi temple in the vicinity of modern Bangalore in 1537. Kempe Gowda referred to the new city as ""Kandubhumi"" or ""Land of Heroes"".[7] Within the Bengaluru Fort, the city was divided into subdivisions - each called a ""patte"" (camp). The city had two main streets. Chikkapete Road ran east-west and Thottapete Road ran north-south. The point where these intersected formed Thottapete Square, the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda's successor, Kempe Gowda II, built the four famous towers that mark the boundaries of Bangalore.[13] During Vijayanagara rule, Bengaluru was also known as ""Devarayanagara"" and ""Kalyanapura"" (""Magnificent City""). After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, the rule of Bangalore changed hands. In 1638, a large Bijapur force led by Ranatullah Khan along with Shaji Bhonsle defeated Kempe Gowda III. Bangalore was gifted to Shahji. In 1687, he defeated the Mughal general Qasim Khan Shahji's son Ekoji and sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodiyar (1673–1704) of Mysore for 300,000 rupees.[14][15] After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759, Hyder Ali, the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, declared himself the de facto ruler of Mysore. Later the rule passed to Tipu Sultan, son of Hyder Ali, known as the Tiger of Mysore. Bengaluru was eventually annexed to the British Indian Empire after Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799). The British handed over the administrative control of Bengaluru ""Bede"" to the Emperor of Mysore, keeping only the Cantonment under their control. The 'seat' of the Mysore kingdom was first established in Mysore in 1799. Then it was shifted to Bangalore in 1804. During this period it was easy for the British to recruit laborers from the Madras Presidency and transfer them to the Cantonment area. The Kingdom of Mysore shifted its capital from Mysore to Bangalore in 1831.[16] Two major developments of this period contributed to the rapid growth of the city: one of them was the introduction of telegraph links and the other was the railway connection to Madras in 1864.  Bangalore became a twin city in the 19th century. The ""Bede"" residents were mostly Kannada. The residents of the ""Cantonment"" area created by the British were overwhelmingly Tamil.[17] In 1898, a plague epidemic broke out in Bangalore. This greatly reduced the population of the city. New expansion areas of Malleswara and Basavanagudi were created to the north and south of 'Bede'. Telephone wires were laid to coordinate epidemic prevention measures. A Health Officer was also appointed in 1898. In 1906, Bangalore became the first city in India to get electricity. Electricity is sourced from a hydroelectric plant located at Sivasamudra. Bangalore's fame as India's garden city began in 1927 during the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the reign of Krishnaraja Vodiyar IV. Parks, buildings and hospitals were built to beautify the city. After India's independence in August 1947, Bengaluru continued to be part of the new Mysore Kingdom, with the Maharaja of Mysore as its head. Public sector jobs and education created opportunities for Kannadas from other parts of the state to migrate into the city. Bengaluru saw rapid growth during the decades 1941-51 and 1971-81. This led to the migration of many people from North Karnataka to the city. By 1961, Bangalore was the sixth largest city in India with a population of 1,207,000.[13] In the following eras, Bangalore's manufacturing base continued to expand with the emergence of many private companies in the city. Bengaluru saw a boom in its real estate market in the 1980s and 1990s. This development was fueled by capital investors from other parts of the country converting Bangalore's large number of vacant plots and houses into high-rises.[18] In 1985, Texas Instruments was the first multinational company to set up its base in Bangalore. Other IT companies followed suit. By the end of the 20th century, Bangalore was firmly establishing itself as the Silicon Valley of India. Geography   Bangalore is located in the South East of the South Indian state of Karnataka. It lies at an average elevation of 920 m (3,018 ft) on the Mysore Plateau (part of the vast pre-Cambrian Deccan Plateau in the heartland). It is 741 km² (286 mi²).[19] Located in the area. Major part of Bengaluru city is located in Bengaluru city district of Karnataka. The surrounding rural areas are part of Bengaluru Village District. The Karnataka government has created a new district called Ramanagara from the old Bengaluru village district. There is no major river running through the city. However, about 60 km (37 mi) to the north, the Archavati River meets the Tenpenna River at Nandi Hill. A small tributary of Argavati River, Virtsapavati River originates in Basavanagudi within the city and flows through the city. The Arkawati and Vridhapavati rivers together carry the bulk of Bangalore's waste. A sewage system built in 1922 covers 215 km² (133 mi²) of the city and connects five sewage treatment plants located on the outskirts of Bangalore.[20] In the 16th century, to meet the city's water needs Kempe Gowda I built many lakes. The most prominent of these lakes was the Kempembudi Gere. During the early 20th century, Nandi Hills Waterworks was established by Sir Mirza Ismail (Mysore Diwan, 1926-41 AD) to supply water to the city. Currently Cauvery River contributes about 80% of the city's water supply. The remaining 20% ​​is Thippakondanahalli and Hesaraghatta are obtained from the reservoirs of the Argavati River.[21] Bengaluru receives 800 million liters (211 million US gallons) of water per day. This is more than any other Indian city.[22] However, Bengaluru faces water scarcity at times especially during summer seasons. Bengaluru has many fresh water lakes and ponds. Major among them are Madiwala Lake, Heppel Lake, Alsur Lake and Sangki Lake. Groundwater appears from the silt and sand layers of sedimentary deposits. As far as the flora of the city is concerned, there is a large number of deciduous trees and a small number of coconut trees. Although Bengaluru is classified as a second-tier (a stable zone) earthquake zone, it has seen earthquakes as large as 4.5 on the Richter scale.[23] Climate Due to its high altitude, Bangalore enjoys mostly pleasant weather throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can cause discomfort in summer.[24] January is the coldest month. The average minimum temperature is 15.1°C. April is the hottest month. The average high temperature is 33.6°C.[25] The highest temperature recorded in Bangalore was 38.9°C. The lowest recorded temperature was 7.8°C (January 1884).[26][27] Winter temperatures rarely fall below 12°C. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 36–37°C (100°F). Bengaluru receives rainfall from both the northeast and southwest monsoons. September, October and August are the wettest months respectively.[25] Summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms. It also causes power outages and localized flooding from time to time. The highest rainfall in a 24-hour period was recorded on October 1, 1997.[28] City Administration The Purugath Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is responsible for the administration of the city.[29] Purugath is run by the Bangalore Mahanagara Balike Metropolitan Council. Councilors are elected from each ward. Assembly elections are held every 5 years. A mayor and commissioner of the council are elected on the basis of reservation. This seat is reserved for a woman candidate from Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes or Other Backward Classes.  Bangalore's rapid growth has created many problems related to traffic congestion and aging infrastructure. These are challenging issues for Bengaluru Mahanagara Balike to address. The 2003 Bethel Environmental Assessment System (BEES) of Bengaluru's physical, biological and socio-economic metrics indicated that Bengaluru's water quality and regional and aquatic ecosystems are near ideal. The city's socioeconomic metrics (traffic congestion, quality of life) scored low.[30] The unplanned growth of the city resulted in a major traffic crisis. The Corporation tried to solve this problem by constructing a flyover system and one-way roads. Although some flyovers and one-way roads have helped alleviate traffic congestion to some extent, they have not been able to compensate for the tremendous growth in urban traffic.[30] In 2005, both the central government and the state government allocated a significant amount in their annual budget allocations for the development of Bangalore's infrastructure.[31] Bengaluru Mahanagara Polike works in collaboration with Bengaluru Development Corporation (BDA) and Bengaluru Planning Task Force (BATF) in designing and implementing city development plans. Bengaluru generates 3,000 tonnes of solid waste per day. Of this, 1,139 tonnes are collected and sent to waste disposal units such as the Karnataka Sewage Development Board. The remaining solid waste is dumped by the municipality in open spaces or on roadsides outside the city.[32] Bengaluru City Police (BCP) consists of six geographical zones including Traffic Police, City Armed Police, Central Crime Branch and City Crime Records Branch. It also operates 86 police stations, including two all-women police stations.[33] As the capital of the state of Karnataka, Bengaluru is home to the main state government institutions such as the Karnataka High Court, the Karnataka Legislative Assembly and the Karnataka Governor's House. Bengaluru contributes three members to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India, and 28 members to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly.[34] The electricity system in Bangalore is controlled by the Karnataka Power Distribution Corporation (KPTCL). Like many cities in India, Bengaluru has a notified blackout. Especially during summers. It is necessary for power supply companies to meet the consumption of both household needs and corporate needs. economy Bangalore's economy (2002–03 total district revenue) makes it a major economic center of India.[35] With an economic growth of 10.3%, Bengaluru is the fastest growing major city in India.[36] Additionally, Bengaluru is India's fourth largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market.[37] The city is home to more than 10,000 dollar millionaires and is the third largest center for the number of high net worth individuals. It also has about 60,000 super-rich people with investable surplus.[38] By 2001, Bangalore's contribution to foreign direct investment was the fourth largest among Indian cities.[39] In 1940, industrial pioneers Sir Mirza Ismail and Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya played an important role in developing Bangalore's strong manufacturing and industrial base. Many public sector organizations have their headquarters in Bangalore. In June 1972, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was created under the Department of Space and headquartered in the city. India's second and third largest software companies Infosys and Wipro have their headquarters in Bangalore. Bengaluru is known as the Silicon Valley of India due to the large number of IT companies located in the city. These contributed 33% of India's ₹144,214 crore (US$20billion) 2006–07 IT services exports.[40] The development of information technology has also presented unique challenges to the city. Clashes sometimes occur between the city's IT companies, which demand improvements in the city's infrastructure, and the state government, which has the rural population of Karnataka as its main vote bank.[41] Bangalore is the hub of biotechnology related industries in India. In 2005, about 47% of India's 265 biotech companies were located here; These include India's largest biotechnology company, Biocon.[42][43] Transportation     The newly constructed Bengaluru International Airport (ATA code: BLR) in Bengaluru commenced its operations on 24 May 2008. Earlier the city was served by HAL Airport. It was the fourth busiest airport in India.[44][45][46] Air Deccan and Kingfisher Airlines have their headquarters in Bangalore.[47]  A rapid transit system called Namma Metro has been developed and operationalized. At completion it will comprise 41 stops and an over- and under-ground train network.[48] Bengaluru is well connected with other cities of the country through Indian Railways. Rajdhani Express connects the city with the Indian capital New Delhi. Bengaluru is also connected to many cities in Karnataka, as well as Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and other major cities in India, via the reserve route.[49] Three-wheeled, black and yellow automatic tricycles called autos are popular for motorized transport.[50]] These are metered and carry up to three passengers. Rental services are also available for a small additional fee.[50] Buses operated by the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) are also a mode of public transport in the city.[51] Passengers can get tickets while traveling in these buses. The transport corporation also provides bus advance pass facility for frequent commuters. The transport corporation also operates air-conditioned, red Volvo buses on major routes.[51] The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation operates 6,600 buses on 5,700 timetables connecting Bangalore to other parts of Karnataka and other states.[52] People's Biology   Bengaluru is the third largest city in India by population and the 28th largest city in the world. In 2009 the population was estimated at 5,300,000.[53] Bengaluru was the fastest growing Indian city after New Delhi during 1991-2001. The growth rate during this decade was 38%. Bangaloreans are referred to as Bangaloreans in English and Bengalurunavaru in Kannada. Kannada speakers constitute about 39% of the city's population.[54][55] Due to the multicultural nature of the city, people from other states come and settle in Bengaluru.[56] Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes constitute 14.3% of the city's population. Apart from Kannada and English, Tamil, Telugu and Hindi are other major languages ​​spoken in the city.[57] According to the 2001 India Census, 79.37% of Bengaluru's population is Hindu. This is roughly in line with the national average.[58] Muslims constitute 13.37% of the population. This is also roughly in line with the national average. Christians and Jains constitute 5.79% and 1.05% of the population respectively. This is double the national average for these religions. Anglo-Indians are also a significant community in the city. Women constitute 47.5% of Bengaluru's population. Bengaluru has the second highest literacy rate (83%) among Indian cities after Mumbai. About 10% of Bangalore's population lives in slums[59]. This is relatively low compared to Mumbai and other cities in developing countries such as Nairobi.[60] The 2004 National Crime Records Bureau points out that Bengaluru accounts for 9.2% of the total crime reported among India's 35 largest cities. Delhi and Mumbai contribute 15.7% and 9.5% respectively.[61]  Culture  Bengaluru is known as the ""Garden City of India""[62]. This is because it has many public parks including Lal Bagh and Kappan Park. The government festival is Dussehra, a traditional celebration symbol of the erstwhile Mysore Empire. This festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm. The city celebrates one of the most important ancient festivals of Bangalore called ""Karaka Shaktiyotsava"" or Bengaluru Karaka.[63] Diwali, the ""Festival of Lights"" is another major festival celebrated across lifestyle and religious lines. Other traditional Indian festivals such as Vinayagar Chaturthi, Ugadi, Sankranti, Eid-ul-Fitr, and Christmas are also celebrated here. Bengaluru is the home of the Kannada screen world. About 80 Kannada films are released from here every year.[64] Late actor Dr. Rajkumar is one of the most prominent contributors to the Kannada film industry. Culinary diversity reflects Bangalore's social and economic diversity. Rotorua stalls, tea stalls, and South Indian, North Indian, Chinese and Western fast food are popular in the city. Udupi restaurants are very popular. These primarily serve regional vegetarian dishes. Bengaluru is also a major center of Indian classical music and dance. Traditional music and dance concerts are widely held throughout the year especially during Ramnavami and Vinayagar Chaturthi festivals. The city also has a vibrant Kannada theater movement. Organizations like Ranga Sankara are taking this forward. Bangalore has also become one of the premier venues for international rock concerts.[65] game Batting is one of the most popular sports in Bangalore. Many national batsmen have hailed from Bangalore, including former Indian captains Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, and Robin Uthappa and many others. Many boys can be seen playing roadside cricket on the roads and in many public places of the city. Bangalore's premier global batting stadium M. Chinnaswamy Arena is there. It has a seating capacity of 40,000[66]. 1987 Cricket World Cup, 1996 Cricket World Cup and 2011 Cricket World Cup were played here. Indian Premier League (IPL) affiliate Bangalore Royal Challengers and Premier Hockey League (PHL) affiliate Bangalore High-Flyers are based in the city. India's Davis Cup tennis team members Mahesh Bhupathi[67] and Rogan Bopanna[68] also reside in Bangalore. The city hosts the Bangalore Open of the Women's Tennis Association every year. Beginning in September 2008, the annual Kingfisher Airlines Tennis Open ATP tournament is also held in Bangalore.[69] Other sports celebrities from Bangalore include national swimming champion Nisha Millet, world snooker champion Pankaj Advani and former All England Open badminton champion Prakash Padukone. Education  Until the early 19th century, education in Bangalore was mainly run by religious leaders and was limited to students of that religion.[70] Western education system was introduced during the rule of Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. Two schools were established in Bangalore. Following this, the Wesleyan Mission established a school in 1851. In 1858 Bangalore High School was started by Govt.[71] In post-independence India, schools for young children have undergone a transformation.[72] There are various schools in Bangalore that provide primary and secondary education under one of the education boards such as School Leaving Certificate (SSLC), Indian Certificate of Secondary Education and Board of Intermediate Secondary Education.[73] Bengaluru schools are either government schools or private schools (government aided and non-government aided).[74] After completing their secondary education, students usually pursue pre-university PUC courses in one of three disciplines: Arts, Commerce or Science.[75] After completing the required course, students can continue their studies by enrolling in general or technical courses in universities. Established in 1964, Bangalore University provides affiliation to around 500 colleges. The total number of students is more than 300,000. The university has two campuses within Bangalore, Gnanabharati and Central College.[76] The Indian Institute of Science, established in Bangalore in 1909, is India's premier institution for scientific research and study.[77] National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIM-B) and Indian Institute of Statistical Research are also located in Bangalore. India's premier mental health institution is also located in Bangalore.[77] National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), a premier mental health institute, is located in Bangalore. media The first printing press was established in Bangalore in 1840.[78] In 1859, the Bengaluru Herald was the first bi-weekly English newspaper to be published in Bengaluru[79]. In 1860, the Mysore Virutina Bodhini became the first Kannada newspaper to be sold in Bangalore.[78] Currently, Vijaya Karnataka and The Times of India are the largest selling newspapers in Bengaluru in Kannada and English respectively. Close to these are Prajavani and Deccan Herald.[80][81] All India Radio, the official broadcaster of the Government of India, began broadcasting from its Bangalore station in 1955.[82] Radio City was the first private commercial radio station to broadcast in Bangalore.[83] In recent years, a number of traditional stations have started broadcasting from Bangalore.[84] Doordarshan established its broadcasting center here on 1 November 1981 and began broadcasting.[85] A production center was established in 1983 at Doordarshan's Bangalore office. This was followed by the launch of a news program in Kannada from 19 November 1983.[85] Doordarshan also launched a Kannada satellite channel on 15 August 1991. It is now named DD Santana.[85] Private news channels set foot in Bangalore in September 1991 when Star TV's channels started broadcasting.[86] Although the number of satellite televisions available in Bangalore has grown exponentially over the years[87], this growth has also led to occasional conflicts between television spectrum distributors.[88] Bengaluru STPI was the first internet service provider to start in Bangalore. The company started providing Internet services in the early 1990s.[89] However, this internet service was mostly used by corporations. This changed only after VSNL introduced public telephone wireline internet services in late 1995.[90] Bengaluru is now the city with the highest number of broadband internet connections in India.[91] For additional viewing Bangalore tourist sites Karnataka Our metro Notes  Additional reading Hassan, Fazlul.

"The heart (sound) or heart (sound) or vital (meaning the first or primary thing to live) (synonyms: thorax, thorax) is a muscular organ found in all organisms with a circulatory system.[1] Its job is to pump blood through the blood vessels throughout the body by continuously dilating and contracting. Through this, the blood supplies the body with vital nutrients and nutrients and helps in removing metabolic waste products. In vertebrates the heart is composed of a self-propelled striated muscle called cardiac muscle. It is found only in the heart. An average human heart rate is 72 beats per minute. A 66-year-old adult will pulse approximately 2.5 billion times in his lifetime. The heart weighs an average of 250 – 300 g (9 – 11 oz) in females and 300 – 350 g (11 – 12 oz) in males.[2] The tubes that bring blood to the heart are called veins or vessels and the tubes that carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body are called arteries or veins. The heart is enclosed within a protective sac called the pericardium or pericardium. The fluid found in the pericardium helps protect the heart from shocks and prevents it from rubbing against other parts as it contracts and expands. The wall of the heart is made up of the epicardium (a part of the pericardium), the myocardium, and the intima. Cardiac conduction system helps the heart to function smoothly. system  The structure of the heart differs between animals, with cephalopods having two ""gill hearts"" and one ""unit heart"". In vertebrates, the heart is located in the front of the body behind the sphincter. The pericardium is always surrounded by pericardium. Location and format The human heart is housed within a protective sac of double membrane in the middle mediastinum at the level of the fifth and eighth thoracic vertebrae. This is called the pericardium or pericardium. The pericardium is found adjacent to the thorax.[3] Fluid is found within the two-layered pericardium. This fluid protects the heart from sudden shocks and prevents friction when the heart beats. The wall of the heart is made up of the epicardium (a part of the pericardium), the myocardium, and the intima. The back of the heart is located in front of the vertebrae. The anterior part of the heart lies behind the sternum and rib cages.[4] At the top of the heart are connected the great arteries and veins. The apex of the heart is located at the level of the third rib.[4] The heart is conical in shape. The lower end of the heart, called the pericardium, is located to the left of the ribcage. The majority of the heart is located in the left chest (right side in visceral transposition). The left side of the heart is powerful enough to pump blood to all parts of the body except the lungs.[4] Since the heart is located between the left and right lungs, the left lung has a cavity where the heart can be located. As a result, the left lung is smaller than the right lung. [4] The heart is made up of involuntary smooth muscle called cardiac muscle. heart chamber The heart has four chambers. Two upper chambers that receive blood and two lower chambers that expel blood. The epicardium is connected to the ventricles by the epicardial valves. These are located in the basement. The one seen on the left side is known as the Irugur occlusion and the one seen on the right side is known as the Mukkur occlusion. The separation of the heart by the atrial septum is visible on the outside of the heart as a cut called the coronary sulcus. [5] An auricle-shaped protrusion is found in the left and right atria, which is also a small chamber-like structure. This is called atrial fibrillation or atrial fibrillation.[6] The left upper and lower ventricles together are called the left heart, similarly the right ventricles together are called the right heart. The two lower chambers of the heart are separated by the ventricular fissure. The lower chambers of the heart are thicker than the upper chambers. In particular, the left atrium is thicker than the right atrium because it requires more velocity to pump blood throughout the body. Heart block   Four types of valves are found in mammals, including humans. The two valves that control blood flow between the atria and atria are the two-leaflet bicuspid valve on the left side and the three-leaflet valve on the right side. [7] Their leaflets are connected by capillaries,[8] which are attached to the ventricle wall by myocardium. Each petal is attached to each mycelium. For example, a two-lobed bicuspid valve is attached to the left ventricular wall by two myocardium.[7] Clots between the chambers of the heart and the outflow arteries are semicircular occlusions. The aortic valve is located between the left lower ventricle and the aorta. A pulmonary embolus is located between the right lower ventricle and the pulmonary artery. These are not attached to the myocardium. Heart wall  The heart is surrounded by the pericardium. It has two layers of membranes. The outer membrane is called the outer membrane. The inner membrane is known as the superior atrial membrane.[4] Between these two is the outer membrane.  The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: the outer epicardium (a part of the pericardium), the middle myocardium, and the inner epicardium. The endocardium is made up of simple squamous cells. It covers the heart chambers and valves. It continues into the epithelial cells of nerves and vessels. And the smooth muscle is connected to the cardiac muscle through the sympathetic nervous system. A protein called endothelin or endothelin is secreted by endothelial cells. They also play a role in controlling the heart's contractions.[4] The heart muscle that makes up the middle myocardium is made up of involuntary striated muscle. Cardiac muscle consists of two types of cells, the muscle cells that perform the contractile function and the pacemaker cells that coordinate the electrical conduction of the heart. Of these, the majority (99%) are cardiac muscle, with the remainder (1%) being pacemaker cells.[4] Hair follicle circulation  Capillary circulation helps the muscular parts of the heart receive nutrients and nutrients and remove waste products. It includes veins, vessels, and lymphatic vessels. Capillaries are blood vessels that supply vital blood to the heart muscle. Cardiac vessels are blood vessels that carry blood removed from the heart muscle. Aorta are divided into left and right and arise from the aorta. A blockage in these causes a heart attack. Nerve supply The heart receives its nerve supply through the afferent nerve and sympathetic innervation, which has accessory motor activity. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are controlled by the sphincter. The heart rate varies due to the activity of these nerves. The sympathetic nervous system is activated during exercise, stress, blood loss, dehydration. It increases heart rate. Conversely, activation of the saphenous vein slows down the heart rate. All these nerves together form a plexus called the cardiac plexus.[9] Parasympathetic denervation helps reduce heart activity. Sympathetic denervation helps increase heart function. Cardiac physiology   Blood flow Heart acts as a continuous pump for continuous circulation of blood. The flow of blood leaving the heart is classified into two types, namely the pulmonary circulation and the pulmonary circulation. From the left atrium of the heart, the vital and nourishing blood is transported through the veins to the cells in all parts of the body. From there, the de-oxygenated blood that is brought through the vessels reaches the right ventricle through the superior aorta and the inferior aorta. This is called mass circulation. Deoxygenated blood from the right atrium reaches the lungs where it is purified and returned to the left ventricle as deoxygenated blood, which is called the pulmonary circulation. Heart circle The contraction and expansion of the heart during each heartbeat and the electrical events that occur during it are called the cardiac cycle.[10] The contraction of the heart is called systole and the expansion of the heart is called diastole. Cardiac output The total volume of blood ejected by the left and right lower ventricles during heart contraction per minute is called cardiac output. Cardiac output is generally considered to be five liters per minute. Stroke volume is the volume of blood ejected by the left ventricle during one contraction of the heart. This is 70 milliliters for a healthy 70 kilogram human. [11] Cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate [4] For example, cardiac output = 70 ml X 72 = 5040 ml/min The data obtained by relating body surface area to cardiac output is called cardiac index. Electrical conductivity  Sinus rhythm is a regular irregular heartbeat that originates from the sinus node, the pacemaker of the heart. Signaling through electrical currents to the heart muscle is necessary to maintain a steady state of contraction and expansion of the heart. A specialized set of cardiac muscle cells such as the ventricular node, the epicardial node, the bundle of muscle and its branches, and the bundle of fibers together form the cardiac conduction system. The pancreatic node is located at the top of the right atrium near the epigastrium.[12] Heart rate Heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. Generally, 60 to 100 is considered a normal heart rate in adults. Cells in the pituitary gland have secretory receptors in their membranes. As sodium rapidly enters the cell, they receive a positive charge. This is called depolarization, and it occurs continuously and steadily.[4] Once the cell is sufficiently stimulated, the channel that allows sodium to enter closes. After this, calcium is taken in as soon as potassium is released. Calcium binds to a protein called troponin C, which causes the heart muscle to contract. The heart dilates when turapon is unbound. Heart rate is controlled by the cardiac center in the brain via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.[13] Blood vessels contain structures called pressure sensors. These are stretched and stimulated when the blood vessel constricts or dilates. This is reported to the cardiovascular center. This keeps the blood pressure stable. As blood pressure decreases, the contraction of pressure sensors decreases. The rate at which pressure sensors transmit information to the brain decreases, causing the cardiovascular center to increase sympathetic nerve activity and decrease parasympathetic nerve activity. For example, an injured person has a drop in blood pressure due to hemostasis. Pressure sensors sense this and are triggered and report the information to the cardiovascular center. Brain increases sympathetic nerve activity. This increases the heart rate.[14] Factors that can alter heart rate include exercise, age, body temperature, basal metabolic rate, and mood. An overdose of epinephrine (adrenalin), norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones may increase heart rate. Calcium, potassium and sodium are important elements in maintaining regular heart rate. heart sound Normally two types of heart sounds can be heard in a healthy heart. Their sounds are commonly described as ""lub-dub"". These are called first (S1) and second (S2) heart sounds. The first heart sound known as a lube is the sound that occurs when the mitral valve and the valve valve close. A second heart sound called a thump is caused by an aortic occlusion and a pulmonary occlusion. The second heart sound normally separates during inspiration. However, if the gap between these vocal cords increases, it may be associated with diseases. Apart from these there are third (S3, lub-dub-da) and fourth (S4, da-lub-dub) heart sounds. These are commonly known as gallop rhythm. It is so called because of the ""ta-ta-ta"" sound that a horse makes when running.[15] A third heart sound can be seen naturally in teenagers, athletes, and sometimes pregnant women. But if this sound reappears in the later period, it may be due to heart failure. A fourth heart sound is the sound heard just before the first heart sound in hypertension, myocardial hypertrophy. Heart diseases Heart diseases can also be caused by congenital disorders, diseases of the heart valves, diseases of the heart muscle, and diseases of the blood vessels that have a direct connection to the heart. Obstructive heart disease  Valvular heart disease is a disease caused by defects in the valves of the heart. Valvular heart defects can be congenital or acquired after birth. Depending on the severity of the disease, treatment is done with drugs or with corrective surgery or flap replacement surgery. Blood deficiency heart disease  Ischemic heart disease or coronary heart disease occurs due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Capillary thrombosis is the most important cause of ischemic heart disease. The risk of this disease increases with age, smoking, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure etc. Disorders like chest tightness and heart attack occur due to lack of blood supply. heart attack  Myocardial infarction or myocardial infarction occurs when blood supply to parts of the heart is blocked. It is often caused by a blockage or narrowing of a capillary artery. Fatty substances such as cholesterol and white blood cells build up in the walls of these arteries, causing inflammation to form inside, narrowing the artery. This condition in the artery is called atherosclerosis. As a result, there is less blood flow to the heart muscles resulting in a lack of vitality. People with this condition experience chest pain while working hard. By taking rest and taking nitrate tablets, the heart blood flow will be normalized and this pain will decrease. This is called chest compression. If medical help for this condition is not given in time, the inflammation scar will burst and blood will clot in the blood vessels, resulting in permanent blockage. In this case, the specific area of ​​the heart muscle is completely deprived of blood supply. This causes the heart muscles to die. During this time, rest does not relieve the pain. Such a situation is myocardial death. Society and Culture A symbol of lovers It has long been recognized that the heart is located in the center of the body as it is an important organ of the body. The heart is considered to be the source of life, the seat of the soul, and the center of emotions.[16] Thus the symbol of love or love is also the heart. The symbol of the heart is also used in religions. Describing the dehumanized as ""heartless"" is still prevalent in society today. [17] Food The heart of chicken, goat, cow, pig etc. is widely consumed as food. They are protein rich food as they are muscle organ. Hearts of other animals In vertebrates with a circulatory system (vertebrates), the heart is a tubular or sac-like structure that helps pump fluid containing nutrients such as protein, jaggery, and fat. Commonly called the ""spinal tube"" in insects, the ""heart"" of insects is non-oxygenated because they respire through the surface of the body, although some insects such as arthropods and gastropods have hemolymph, which contains the copper-based hemocyanin that preserves oxygen. It is similar to the iron-based platelets found in the erythrocytes of vertebrates.

"Chess, described as the game of kings, is a board game played by two players. 16 pieces per side, 32 pieces are used in this game. It is common for each one to have pods of two different colors. The playing board is square shaped with a total of 64 grids arranged in 8 rows and 8 columns (8 x 8). It is usually arranged in alternating black and white colors. A game based on the chess game. Tactics and trickery are important to this game. Nowadays this sport has also been introduced in the school curriculum. It is played by millions of people around the world in homes, parks, clubs, on the Internet, on computers and competitively. Chess is one of the popular games of mankind. It is described not only as a sport but also as an art and a science. It is sometimes referred to as a war game and a ""cerebral martial art"". Many different chess games and some related games are played all over the world. China's Xiangyi, Sappan's Shogi, Nepal's Budi Sal are famous among them. One's area (white/black) has a king, a queen, two ministers, two knights, two rooks and eight pawns. Each type of fruit moves differently. How to play Chess is a game played by two players. The trick of the game is to capture your opponent's king while protecting your king. If you capture the enemy king before the enemy captures his own king, you win. The game will end.   Chess is played on a checkerboard. This checkerboard consists of 8x8=64 squares alternating white and black as shown in the figure. It has 8 columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (from bottom to top) and 8 columns a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h (from left to right). Each square can be uniquely represented by an algebraic symbol. The first square is (a, 1), the second square is (a, 2) and the 64th square is (h, 8). There are two teams or armies in this game. They are called white force and black force respectively. Each force has 16 pieces. Each army consists of one king, one queen, two ministers, two knights, two castles and eight knights. Initial stage  The initial layer should be as shown in the figure. In the first column or order, the white knight is rook, knight, knight, queen, king, knight, rook, rook. Here the white queen (d, 1) should stand on the white square and the white king (e, 1) on the black square. Eight white soldiers will also stand in the second column. Similarly, in the opposite direction i.e. in the eighth column, Black's rook, knight, knight, queen, king, knight, knight, rook. Here the black queen (d, 8) must stand on the black square and the black king (e, 8) on the white square. Eight black veterans will also stand in the seventh column. Patterns of moving pieces the king A king or king can only move one square at a time from where he is. abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh The white king on the e4 square can move only one square to any of the eight squares: e3,e5.d3,d4,d5,f3,f4,f5. But only in a special type of move is it defined that the king can be moved two squares. The name of this city is castle building (castling). In this way, when the king moves two steps, the rook will stand on the left or right of the king in the next step. In such a game, the king and elephant move simultaneously is called fort building. Thus the king must not move even one of the two castle pieces before building the fort. If you move like that, you can't make a move to build a castle. Also, even if the king is in danger (check), a castle building move cannot be made even if there is danger (check) in the place where the king stands. Building a castle on the queen side is called long castle building.   When the king sets up a fort on his side, it is called a short fort.   the queen The queen can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, horizontally or diagonally from her position. But cannot go beyond one kai. We can move the queen shown in the picture to any of the shown points as needed. Minister Mantri or Chariot' Mode of Movement: A minister or chariot can move any number of squares diagonally. But cannot go beyond one kai. The minister standing at e4 can be moved to any of the 13 steps f5,g6,h7,d5,c6,b7,a8,f3,g2,h1,d3,c2,b1 as needed.  Horse Horse: Can move in a 'D' pattern from its position (one step up-down or space-right followed by two steps in a vertical direction). Only the horse is capable of walking. The knight standing on the e4 square in the picture can be moved to one of the eight squares f6,d6,g5,g3,f3,d3,c3,c5 as needed. Remember that if the knight is on the black square, it will move to the white square and if it stands on the white square, it will move to the black square. Castle Castle: Can move forward, backward, left or right any number of squares from its position. But the fort cannot go beyond a kai. The rook standing on the e4 square in the picture can be moved to any of the 14 squares e5,e6,e7,e8,e3,e2,e1,f4,g4,h4,d4,c4,b4,a4 as needed. Veteran Soldier: A square can only move straight ahead from where it is. But in the beginning only the player who is playing squares forward from his position can move if he wants. A soldier can only make his attack diagonally forward. However, it cannot move two squares from its initial position to avoid an attack.[1] If the black pawn moves next to the white pawn while the white pawn is on row 5, the white pawn can attack the black pawn. This is called Enpassant. By moving the pawn gradually and reaching the last box, the pawn can be promoted and become one of the queen, minister, knight and rook. A pawn standing on the e4 square in the picture can only advance to the e5 square. But this hero can attack and cut the enemy's hair in the f5 and d5 phases. Perhaps if the knight advances gradually and reaches the e8 stage without being cut by the enemy, he will be promoted. game The white army should move first. Players must decide who is the White Legion. Whoever moves first is assumed to have some advantage in the game. The one with the black legion will have to pay extra attention to equalize this early lead. . History thumbnail|Right|Picture of a large chess set in Hobart, Tasmania that many people use when they want to play chess outside. Although there are various opinions about the origin of chess, it is generally accepted that it developed from the game of chess, which was played in India around the seventh century.[2] From here it spread west to Europe and east to Korea with many variations. It spread through Mongolia to Russia. It seems to have been played there as early as the seventh century. This sport spread from India to Persia and spread to many Islamic countries after the Islamic conquest of Persia. It was introduced to Spain in the tenth century by the Muslims. In the 13th century, under the patronage of Alfonso X of Castile, a treatise on the games of chess, backgammon, and dice was written. Chess reached England in the 11th century. There it evolved into different forms like Courier. By the end of the 15th century, rules for the moves of chess pieces came into use in Italy. A rule was introduced that the ""pawns"" (pawn) could move two squares forward on the first move, and the rule that the ""bishop"" could move as far along the diagonal of the open squares came into circulation. Earlier these were allowed to move only two steps diagonally. But their permission to flow through phases has been removed. The power of the ""Irani"" was added to the ability to move only one phase through the corner diameter, allowing it to move in sync and any distance through the open phases, making the ""Irani"" a very powerful weapon. The aforementioned changes led to an additional analysis of chess, creating many engaged chess enthusiasts. Since then, chess in Europe has not changed much and has remained much the same as it is played today. Except for the conditions for equilibrium, all the current formulas were decided in the early 19th century. The most famous piece design known as the ""Staunton"" block was devised by Nathaniel Cooke in 1849 and was officially adopted by the International Chess Federation in 1924 after being adopted by Howard Staunton, a leading chess player of the time. At one time chess games were recorded using descriptive chess notation. Although these are still used by some players, they are gradually being replaced by newer, more concise alphabetic chess symbols. Portable Game Notation (PGN) is the most common notation system in computer application form. The game of chess, which was thought to belong only to the human brain, is now being played not only by humans but also by machines. Although initially used as a mere hobby, computer chess-playing computers have grown to become powerful enough to challenge, and sometimes defeat, even skilled humans. In 1996, Garry Kasparov, the world number one chess player at the time, played a 6-game chess match against the IBM chess computer Deep Blue. Lum shocked the computer world by beating Kasparov in the first game (Deep Blue-Kasparov, 1996, Game 1). However, Kasparov won by winning 3 games and drawing the other two. In 1997, the computer won the 6-game series again. In October 2002, Vladimir Kramnik broke even with the computer program Deep Brits in an eight-game match. In February 2003, Kasparov broke even in a 6-game match with the computer program Deep Junior, and then in a 4-game match with X3D Brits in November. Strategy and Tactics Here strategy refers to a strategy for a long-term goal of a game and strategy refers to tactics for an immediate move. In the game of chess, long-term strategies and immediate strategies are indistinguishable. Because strategic goals can be achieved through strategies. Whereas earlier strategies provide opportunities for strategies during later moves. A game of chess can be divided into three phases due to the different strategy and tactics involved. The first is the ""opening game"", which usually consists of 10 to 25 moves. During this phase players prepare their armies for the coming battle. Next is the ""Middle Game"" which is the maturity of the game. Finally the ""end game"", at which point most of the pieces are usually out. Therefore, the king will have an important role in the game. The opening game The opening game of a chess game starts with some opening moves which are the initial moves. These opening moves are planned based on experiences and are labeled and recognized as small sets. Rui Lopez's opening, Sicilian tackling are some examples. Various opening moves named as such are listed in the reference book The Art of Opening Moves. This list features a wide variety of opening move sequences, ranging from a quiet siege strategy to an aggressive attack strategy. These series are grouped into thirty moves for both sides. Professional chess players spend years studying these opening principles and trying to master them. The basic purpose of most opening moves remains the same. Advancement: The first objective is to plan to prevent the enemy's pieces from penetrating into our territory and at the same time allow our pieces to advance and enter the enemy's territory. This technique teaches us to place our pieces, especially the knight and minister, in useful positions to turn the tide of the game in our favor. Central Squares Control: Another objective is that if the central squares of the chess board are controlled by our pieces, we can easily move our pieces to any area. It is also worth noting that bringing the central squares under our control prevents the enemy's pieces from advancing. Protection of the King: The third objective is to protect the king from dangerous attacks. The basis of this intention was that the timely construction of the fort would help somewhat in the protection of the king. Marching Soldiers: A basic fourth objective is that a soldier can easily advance if he is accompanied by supporting soldiers. Techniques aimed at avoiding creating weaknesses such as the isolated soldier, the soldier hiding behind a soldier's back, and forcing these weaknesses to occur among enemy soldiers. Middle game The middle game is an important part of the game of chess after choosing something in the sequence of opening moves to start the game. The middle game is considered to begin when most of the pieces on the chessboard have a way to advance without interruption. No clear order sets are defined between the opening and middle games. This is because players who complete the opening principles will seek to independently construct unique plans based on the placement, strengths, and weaknesses of their pieces. In this case, players explore the possibilities of attacking, capturing, advancing, sacrificing, etc. tactics against their opponent. Combination moves that can change the course of the game emerge in the mid-game. Combination moves are series of certain tactical moves based on gain. These planned series of moves are linked to the strategy of attacking the enemy Rasa. Certain common modes of movement are named after those who discovered them. For example, Boden Mate or Lasker-Bar combinations. Fundamentals of Strategy Strategy of Chess; It involves assessing the positions of pieces, deciding on goals, and making long-term plans for the game. When evaluating, players should take into account the value of the pieces on the board, the knight formation, the protection of the king, the squares, and the control of key phases and blocks. The key to assessing the positions of the pieces is to calculate the total value of both sides. The rating points used for this are based on experience. A point for veterans in general; Three points are awarded to the knight and minister, five points to the rook and nine points to the queen. At the end of the game, the king is given more value in the knight or minister but less value in the rook. Thus the king is awarded four points as fighting value. These base values ​​are modified depending on other circumstances such as the position of the pieces, interactions between pieces, type of position, etc. For example, advanced veterans are valued more than entry-level veterans. Having two ministers has the same value as having one minister and one horse. While the horse is more valuable in closed positions with many soldiers. Mantri has added value if the position is open with fewer soldiers. Another important factor in evaluating chess positions is ""squadron formation"". Soldiers are the least mobile pieces on the chessboard. As such they are relatively stable and often determine the strategic nature of the game. Single, dual, backward, veteran or emerging veteran organizations are vulnerable. Once a pattern is established, it usually becomes established. Thus, unless there are other opportunities such as the possibility of an attack, it is customary to guard against such a situation. Fundamentals of Strategy Strategies refer to short-term actions. Since these are short-lived, the human brain or a computer can easily predict their effects. However, the depth of this prediction depends on the skill of the player and the power of the computer. A more in-depth prediction is not easy when there is a lot of room for movement on both sides. But in complex times, when there are low stakes, deep, sequential multiple moves can be predicted. Simple, one- or two-move tactical actions—frights, pawn deals, double attacks, etc.—can be combined into more complex strategies. Usually it can come from one side or sometimes from both sides. Theorists have explained many basic strategy patterns and routine moves.

"Tamil Nadu is one of the 29 states of India. Tamil Nadu is also widely known as Tamil Nadu. Its capital is Chennai. Tamil Nadu is located at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. Its territorial boundaries are Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in the west and north. The state of Tamil Nadu has borders around the Puducherry and Karaikal regions of Puducherry Union Territory. It is geographically bounded by the Eastern Ghats to the north, the Western Ghats to the west by the Neelamalai escarpment, the Annai Mountain escarpment, and the Palakkad Pass, to the east by the Bay of Bengal, to the southeast by the Gulf of Mannar and the Straits of Baku, and to the south by the Indian Ocean. Tamil Nadu was known as Madras State in English and Chennai Province in Tamil. Protests were held to change it to Tamil Nadu. Sankaralinganar was resurrected after fasting for 76 days[11]. Later the name Madras State was changed to Tamil Nadu in 1969. Tamil Nadu is the 11th largest state in India by area and seventh largest in population. It is also the fourth largest contributor to India's GDP (as of 2010)[12]. In 2006 it was ranked tenth (sixteenth when including the United States) on the Human Development Index.[13] It is also the most urbanized state in India.[14] With 6% of India's population, it is the state with the highest number of commercial establishments (10.56%) and the second highest number of employment opportunities (9.97%)[15]. BC Tamils ​​have been living in this area since 500 BC. Tamil language inscriptions and literature dating back more than 20,000 years are available.[16]According to mythological tradition, Tamil is believed to have been taught to Agathiya by Lord Shiva.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . Tamil Nadu is rich in natural resources, temples inspired by Tamil architecture, hilltops, coastal resorts, places of worship of many religions; There are eight World Heritage Sites in Tamil Nadu.[25][26] Geography  Tamil Nadu is located in the southern coast of the Indian peninsula. In the north are the states of Karunadakam and Andhra, and in the west is Kerala. The Union Territory of Puducherry (formerly known as Pondicherry) is located on the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu. To the south-east of this state is the island of Sri Lanka. Unlike many other parts of the country, Tamil Nadu receives rainfall during the months of October – December from the ""Northeast monsoon"". During this period, the farmers depend heavily on the rains that come from the cyclones that form in the Bay of Bengal. Cauvery, the state's sixth major river, originates in Kodaku Hills in Karnataka state in the north and flows into Tamil Nadu. Vaigai, Tamiraparani and Palaru are other major rivers. Chennai, known as Madras until 1996, is the largest city and capital of the state of Tamil Nadu. Thirteen kilometers long and second longest beach in the world, Marina Beach is located in Chennai. Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, Salem, Thanjavur, Dindigul, Tirunelveli, Erode, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Tuticorin and Vellore are other major cities of Tamil Nadu. History   Tamil Nadu was ruled by Chera, Chola and Pandya kings in ancient times. Also, the state is an artistic region with many temples and sculptures. A song depicting the borders of Tamil Nadu Vada Vengadam South Kumari Aidai Tamil component Nallulagam Defines that (Tolkappiyam, special crop, 1-3). The land where the Tamil people used to live was called Tamil Nadu. The following literature references may be cited as proof of this: Tamil Nadu to listen to Vayaka (Purananuru, 168:18) Tamil Nadu is surrounded by this sea wall (Patiruppattu, II Patu, Pathikam: 5) To know Tamil Nadu in the drawing of Imil Sea (Silapathikaram, Arangerukatha: 38) (Manimegala, 17: 62) in Tamil Nadu Marungil within the island of Sambudh. Tamil Nadu has a history of more than 6000 years. There are various opinions about the origin of the Tamil people living here. Some believe that the Tamils, who once lived all over India, were a sub-group belonging to the extra-Indus civilization. The southward migration of this race is associated with the Aryan invasion policy. According to this policy, the Aryan invasion from the north is believed to have pushed the Tamils ​​into South India, which includes the present-day Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. Regardless of the historical facts, the identity of the modern Tamil people can be said to have been developed on the basis of the above principles.  The ancient Tamil Nadu, which included today's Tamil Nadu, was divided into various countries. Many royal dynasties came from time to time. The most prominent among them were the Pandyars, the Cheras, the Cholas, the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, the Vijayanagarats, and the Nayaks. The above-mentioned Madurai is located south of present-day Madurai and it is known through ancient Tamil literature that it was completely destroyed by an oceanic earthquake in later times. The Pandyan nation excelled in education and commerce. The people of Tamil Nadu had trade relations with the Greek and Roman empires of that time. Although subjugated from time to time by the Pallavas and the Cholas, the Pandyas were one of the most powerful royal dynasties in Tamil Nadu. 1st to 4th century AD Chera, Chola and Pandyar rulers of the Sangam era ruled Tamil Nadu from the first century AD to the fourth century. Among them, King Sengutuvan among the Cheras, King Karikal Cholan among the Cholas, and King Nedunjezhiyan among the Pandyas were famous rulers and became very famous. The Cheras were influential in present-day Kerala and Kongu districts, the Cholas in the areas that included Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli, and the Pandyas in Madurai, Nellai and South Kerala districts. It is believed that due to their alliance, Tamil Nadu excelled in their war operations against the rule of the Mauryan Gupta empires in the north. 4th to 9th century AD  AD In the early fourth century, unknown kings called Kalapraras ruled Tamil Nadu. Although their history is not known because they suppressed the Moovendras, the new kings of that time called the Pallavars were granted autonomy and only documents worth mentioning about them have been found. Historians say that the reign of these kings from 4th to 6th century AD is the dark period of Tamil Nadu. AD Later in the fourth century, the Pallavas came to the fore, building fine temples. They ruled South India for 400 years. They controlled most of the Tamil country with Kanchipuram as their capital. The Pallavas defeated the Cholas in the sixth century. It is believed that their influence extended to Sri Lanka. Mahendravarman I and his son Narasimhavarman were the best kings among the Pallavas. Pallavar architecture developed and evolved during the Pallavar period itself. The last Pallava king was Aparasidha. He was defeated by Adittha Chola in the latter part of the ninth century AD and the Pallavarakshi came to an end in Tamil Nadu. It is noteworthy that during this period (300 AD – 600 AD) the Buddha was very influential in Tamil Nadu.[27] 9th to 13th century  The Cholas came back to power in the ninth century AD. During the reign of Rajarasa Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas emerged as a powerful force in South India. Their empire extended to central India, Orissa, and even parts of Bengal.  Rajarasa Chola defeated the Chalukya kings and Chera kings in the east. He also conquered some parts of Sri Lanka from the Pandya kingdom. Rajendra Chola further advanced and captured the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakhsati Islands, Sumatra, Sava, Malaya and Pegu with his fleet. He also defeated Mahipalan who came from the present Bihar and Bengal regions. To celebrate his victory, he built a capital called Cholapuram on the banks of the Ganges. By the thirteenth century the power of the Cholas declined. 14th century After the fall of the Cholas in the 14th century, the Pandyas rose again. However, the upsurge did not last long. In 1316 the Khilsi rulers, invading from the north, besieged and plundered Madurai. The Muslim invasion rendered the Cholas and Pandyas powerless and gave rise to the Islamic ""Bamini"" rule. In response to the Islamic invasion, various small kingdoms came together to form the Visayanagara Empire. The various parts of the empire were divided and rulers called Nayaks were appointed to oversee them. The Visayas Empire, with Ambi as its capital, was prosperous and peaceful. However, the Visayanagara rulers were defeated by the Sultans of the Deccan plateau in the Battle of Talikota around 1564 and all the territories under their control were divided among the Nayaks. During Nayak's rule, Pattana Palayams were formed to reform the political systems of Tamil Nadu and the system of village self-government was abolished. Nayaks from Tanjore and Madurai rose to fame and renovated ancient temples. Present-day Kerala and the adjoining areas of Malabar were under the rule of Chera. The territory of the Cheras bordering the sea was open to trade with the Romans. Until the British invasion, the small area under Cheras rule remained largely uninvaded. 17th century A new chapter in the political history of Tamil Nadu began after the British established the East India Company in Madras (now known as Chennai) in 1639. They took advantage of the quarrels among the petty princes of Tamil Nadu to divide them and started exerting their power over them. Tamil Nadu and subsequently South India gradually came under British control. There were also many Tamil rulers who fought against the British during this period of their domination. Rulers like Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Ananda Padmanabha Nadar, Pulithevan, Velu Nachiyar, Maruthu brothers, Vandayat Devan, Akku Muthukkon, Veeran Sundharalingam, Ondi Veeran, Periya Kaladi, Theeran Chinnamalai led the forces to fight against the whites. 20th century  When India gained independence in 1947, the Madras Province (pictured) became the Madras State. But till 1948 Pudukottai princely state was under the rule of Thondaiman kings. It is one of the last remaining princely states of India. Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, West Kerala, South West Karnataka coastal areas came under Madras State. In 1953, the Telugu-speaking northern parts of Madras State were further divided into Andhra State and the Tamil-speaking southern parts into Madras State. In 1956, the western coastal areas of Madras State were divided between Kerala and Karnataka through an amendment to redefine state boundaries. In 1969, Madras State was renamed as Tamil Nadu. Kanyakumari District, a Tamil-speaking area in the southern part of Travancore-Cochin state, was formed and merged with Tamil Nadu on November 1, 1956. tradition Tamil Nadu is known for its rich literary, musical and dance traditions that continue to flourish today.

India, British East India Company territories (in pink) and other territories in 1837 and 1857  The British East India Company was established in London in 1600 by British merchants with the aim of profiting from trade in the Indian subcontinent. In India in 1611 on the coast of Masulipattanak in Andhra state, in Surat in 1612 and in Chennai in 1640 with the permission of the Vijayanagara Empire. Later they opened trading houses in Bombay city as well. Twenty years later, in 1640, factories and trading companies were established in Calcutta. The British East India Company won the competition with the Portuguese East India Company, the French India Company, and the Dutch India Company. Forces led by East India Company commanders Robert Clive and Andre Bastamandi fought at the Battle of Plassip in 1757 and the Battle of Plassip in 1764. Victory in the Buxar wars gave them the right to collect land in Bengal, Orissa and Bihar, and in 1773 several territories in the lower Gangetic regions. Carnatic Wars (1746 – 1758), Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766-1799), Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772-1818), Anglo-Nepalese War (1814 – 16), Anglo-Burmese Wars (1824-1826), Second British -Through the Sikh Wars (1849–1856), the East India Company expanded its territory in Northwest India, West India, South India, and Northeast India.[5][6] The Treaty of Sugauli at the end of the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16) gave the British East India Company the territories of Garhwal, Kumaun, Sikkim, Darjeeling and the western Terai plains of the Kingdom of Nepal. Assam, Manipur and Arakan were captured from Burma through the Anglo-Burmese wars. Through the Anglo-Maratha wars, they captured Gujarat, Rajputana, Central India and Maharashtra from the Marathas. At the end of the Anglo–Sikh Wars (1848 – 1849)[7], the Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province were annexed by the East India Company. The territories with the cities of Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai as their capitals and the territories annexed to the East India Company such as Rogilkhand, Gorakhpur, Doab, Delhi, Assam, Sindh, Punjab Province, North West Frontier Province and Kashmir were under the direct administration of the East India Company regime. And there were countless princely states, East Indian dominions, territories of sovereign monarchs who ruled arbitrarily (without separate military forces) paying annual tribute to the British East India Company. By the early 19th century, two-thirds of the Indian subcontinent was under Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh princely monarchies. Company Rule in Chennai Province (1684-1858) The British first set foot in Tamil Nadu in the sixteenth century.[8] They built St. George's Fort in present-day Chennai. At first the English East India Company, which was only engaged in trade, gradually began to interfere in local political affairs. In 1684, the Company territories in the south were consolidated under the name Madras Province. In the 18th century, the Carnatic wars played a role for the British. After defeating the Nawab of Arcot and the French forces, many areas under their dominion came under British control. By defeating Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan in the west, the Company's rule was strengthened in the Madras province by defeating the peasants such as Kattabomman, Marudu Pandyar etc. Military and Civil Services Warren Hasting, as the first Governor-General in Calcutta in 1772, quickly expanded the East India Company's Bengal provincial army. Ayodhya gathered soldiers, Rajput Rajputs and Brahmins into company legions.  After the Third Anglo-Mysore War in 1791, the Bengal provincial forces were used to support Madras provincial forces and to support foreign wars like Java and Sri Lanka. At the time of the Vellore Sepoy Mutiny, the East India Company's force in 1806 numbered 1,54,500 soldiers and officers.[10]   Development works Postal and telegraph services were started. English system of education developed. The bus service was launched. Chief Governors In the British East Indies regime, only the names of the Governors-in-Chief during important events are mentioned. } Fall of East India Company rule Due to the increasing corruption in the administration of the Company rule under the East India Company, severe famine and financial bankruptcy of the Company, the dissolution of the East India Company at the end of 1858 after the Sepoy Mutiny ended the Company's rule in India and brought the Indian viceroyalty under its direct control under the leadership of the Viceroy who served under the British Empire.

"Coordinates:  Israel (Israel, Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל‎; Yisrael; Arabic: إِسْرَائِيل‎, Yisrael, officially the Land of Israel; [Medinath Yisrael] (Hebrew), [Daulat Israel] (Arabic)) is a country in Western Asia, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. . It is also called Isuravel, Israel, Israel, Israel in Tamil. It is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest, and the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea to the south. According to its constitution, the country is declared to be a Jewish and democratic country, and the country is governed by a democratic system of parliament. It is the only Jewish homeland in the world.[9] On 29 November 1947 the United Nations General Assembly recommended the partition of British Palestine. On 14 May 1947 David Ben-Gurion, Executive Chairman of the World Zionist Organization[10] and Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, proclaimed ""the creation of the State of Israel in the Land of Israel, to be called the State of Israel"". The Declaration of Independence abolished the British Mandate of Palestine on 15 May 1948.[11][12][13] The next day Israeli forces fought with neighboring Arab countries to invade Israel.[14] Since then, Israel has been fighting several wars with neighboring Arab countries.[15] Through this, Israel annexed the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula (from 1967 to 1982), parts of southern Lebanon (from 1982 to 2000), the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights. From these it incorporated some parts with itself. However, the border with the West Bank is disputed.[16][17][18][19][20] Although Israel has signed peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, so far efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. Tel Aviv is Israel's commercial center,[21] and Jerusalem is the country's most populous city and capital.[note 1][22] The population of Israel was estimated at 8,051,200 in 2013. Of these, 6,045,900 were Jews. Arabs are the country's second largest population, numbering 1,663,400.[2][23] The majority of Israeli Arabs are Muslims, while others are Christians and Turks. Apart from these, there are ethnic minorities such as Marnoirs, Samaritans, Black Hebrew Israelites,[24] Armenians, and Circassians. Israel has a limited number of foreign workers and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system, proportional representation, and universal suffrage.[25][26] The Israeli president is the head of government and the Knesset serves as the legislative body of Israel's assembly. Israel is a developed country and a member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.[27] As of 2012 its economy is ranked 43rd in terms of GDP. Israel ranks highest in the Middle East and third in Asia on the Human Development Index.[28] Its citizens are ranked among the world's most life-expectant citizens in terms of life expectancy.[29] Name  Following independence in 1948, the country assumed the ""State of Israel"" (Medinath Yisrael). In addition, the names Israel, Zion, and Judea were suggested and rejected.[30] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that citizens of Israel would be called Israelis.[31] The names Israel and the children of Israel were used to refer to the biblical state of Israel and the entire Jewish state.[32] The name Israel was used to refer to the patriarch Jacob (Hebrew: , ; Greek: Ἰσραήλ Israel; ""who fought with God""[33]). According to the Hebrew Bible, he got the name after he wrestled with an angel of God and won.[34] The twelve sons of Jacob were the ancestors of the Israelites. They are also known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel or the Children of Israel. Jacob and his sons lived in Canaan but were forced to go to Egypt because of a famine, where their fourth generation lived until Moses.[35] The Israelites returned to Canaan under the leadership of Moses. The earliest archeological material Menephthah contains the word ""Israel"" in the middle. Ancient Egypt in the middle of BC. 13th century.[36] It is also known as Thirunadu because it is sacred to the Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Bahai. The region has been called by many names over the centuries, including Judea, Samaria, South Syria, Syria Palatine, the Empire of Jerusalem, the Province of Itumea, Gole-Syria, Rettenu, and Canaan. History ancient times  According to archaeological evidence, an inscription on an Egyptian monument known as the ""Meneptah Middle Stone"" first mentions the word Israel. The memorial stone is 10 feet tall. It was in B.C. 1211 has been predicted.[37] For more than three thousand years, Jews have considered the land of Israel as their homeland and holy land. According to the Torah, the Jewish patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are believed to have been promised the land by God.[38][39] Biblically, the time of the three patriarchs is considered to be the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC.[40] The first kingdom of Israel was established in approximately B.C. It was created during the 11th century. The Israelite monarchy and state reigned for more than four hundred years with little to no separation.[41][42][43][44] The Northern Israelite kingdom fell in 722 BC. The southern Jewish state lasted until Assyrian rule. By the arrival of Babylonia B.C. In 586 the Jewish state was conquered. earlier During the rule of the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine empires, the Jews left Israel in large numbers. As a result, the number of Jews there is very close. Zionism is aliyah  Modern settlement began in 1881 in what is now Israel or Aliyah. Living as a minority in other countries and suffering from racial discrimination and other suffering, the Jews followed the ideas of Moses Hess and began to buy land from the Ottomans and Arabs little by little in order to regain the land of Israel. Theodor Hertz (1860–1904), an Austrian Jew, started a Zionist movement with the German publication Der Eutenstadt (""The Jewish State"") in 1896, and helped convene the first World Zionist Congress the following year. After the Zionist movement began it paved the way for the establishment of the Second Aliyah. About 40,000 Jews arrived in the years 1904–1914. In 1917, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour declared in the Balfour Declaration that they were consistent in their desire to establish a separate Palestine as a homeland for the Jews. In 1920, Palestine became a British-ruled Commonwealth of Nations. After World War I, there was a third wave of immigration from 1919–1923 and a fourth wave from 1924–1929. These are called Alia-3 and Alia-4. 133 Jews were killed in the Arab riots of 1929. 67 of those killed were from Ebron. By 1933, the rise of Nazism led to a fifth wave of Jewish immigration. After this aliyah-5, Jews rose from 11% of the area's population in 1922 to 30% in 1940. Of the land, 28% was purchased by Zionist companies. Apart from this, Jews had also purchased lands privately. The southern half of Israel was an arid desert and sparsely populated. After the mass killing of many Jews in Europe's largest genocide before World War II, large numbers of foreign Jews immigrated without permission (illegally). At the end of World War II there were approximately 600,000 Jews in Palestine. In 1939, Britain planned to limit Jewish immigration to Palestine to 75,000 during the war and restrict their purchase of land. It may replace 36-39 Arabic letters. The plan was viewed by Jews and Zionists as a betrayal of the 1917 Balber Decree. Nor were the Arabs satisfied; Because they demanded a total ban on Jewish immigration. However, Britain stuck to the plan until UN ratification. Secret groups (pasharas) of Jews With growing tensions between the Palestinians and the Jews, and the lack of commitment from the British, the Jews decided to defend themselves. Arab nationalists who opposed the Balfour Declaration and the Jewish state incited anti-Jewish riots in Jerusalem, Hebron, Jaffa, and Haifa. Following the anti-Semitic riots of 1921, an organization called the Haganah was formed by Jews for self-defense. In 1931, the Haganah split and the Irgun left. The Irgun pursued a more radical line of action, responding to violence against Jews and attacking the British UN surrender government. A more radical activist Lehi group broke away from the Irgun. As an alternative to the Irgun policy, it refused to cooperate with Britain in World War II. These groups had a major impact on the rise of the Israeli Defense Forces before the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the influx of Israeli refugees such as the Aliya-Beth. Founding of the country   In 1947, unable to prevent or control the increasing violence between Jews and Arabs, Britain decided to withdraw from its rule. In 1947, the UN General Assembly approved the partition of Palestine into two countries. It was to give 55% of the land to the Jews and 45% to the Arabs. It also decided that the city of Jerusalem should be a city governed by the nations of the world. It was said that this decision was to avoid that the people of Israel would claim Jerusalem with great authority. On November 29, 1947, when the World Assembly adopted the partition plan, David Ben-Gurion on behalf of the Jews temporarily accepted it, but the Arab League refused. The ensuing civil war, which resulted in attacks by Arabs on Jews and Jews on Arabs, became the first phase of the Israeli War of Independence in 1948. Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948, before British Mandate ended at 5:00 PM on May 15, 1948. The liberation war and the gathering of people  After the creation of the Kingdom of Israel, the armies of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq joined the war, and the 1948 Arab-Israeli War reached its second stage. Syrian, Lebanese, and Iraqi forces from the north were stationed on the Israeli border; Jordanian forces capture East Jerusalem and besiege West Jerusalem. The Haganah stopped such infiltrating forces, and the Irgun forces stopped the Egyptian forces. In June 1948, the UN declared a one-month ceasefire; At that time the Israel Defense Forces were attacked by the government.. After several months of war, in 1949, an armistice agreement was signed and temporary borders were established. Israel reached 26% of the treaty areas west of the Jordan River. Jordan refers to the mountainous regions of Judea and Samaria, the 'West Bank'. Egypt reached a small coastal land known as Gaza. During and after the war, Israeli Prime Minister David Bengurian ordered the dissolution of organizations such as Palmach, Irgun, and Lehi. The Irgun and Lehi were banned as terrorist organizations after killing a Swedish embassy worker. Many Arabs left or were expelled from the new state of Israel. (The number of refugees has been estimated at 600,000 to 900,000; the UN count is 711,000.) Meanwhile, 1,000,000 Jews were expelled from Arab countries. (sources are questionable) Holocaust survivors and Jewish refugees from Arab countries doubled Israel's population in one year. In the 1950s and 1960s In 1954–1955, Prime Minister Moshe Chared's government was discredited after failing to bomb Egypt. In 1956, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal much to the displeasure of the British and the French. Following this, Israel made a covert alliance with the two European governments and launched a war against Egypt. After the Suez standoff, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula under international pressure. Ben Gurion became Prime Minister again in 1955 and resigned in 1963. He was succeeded by Lee Wai Eshkal as Chief Minister. In 1961, Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, who directed the Jewish extermination program known as 'The Final Solution', was arrested and brought to Israel for trial and execution. Eichmann was the only person hanged by the Israeli courts. In May 1967, tensions flared again between Israel and its neighbors. Syria, Jordan and Egypt spoke of war heroism; Egypt UN Expelled the audience. When Egypt blockaded Israeli ships at Tirana Guda, taking it as a sign of war, Israel preemptively attacked Egypt on June 5. In the six-day Arab-Israeli war, Israel defeated the Arab forces and crushed the air force. East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan Heights were captured from the Arabs. The 'Green Line'-1949 became the administrative boundary of the captured lands. Ten years later, a peace treaty with Egypt ceded Gaza to Egypt. In 1967, the American ship Liberty was attacked by Israeli planes, killing 34 American troops; Later investigation confirmed that it was a misidentification of the vessel. In 1969. A woman named Golda Mere became the Chief Minister. In the 1970s After the war of 1967, in the years 1968-1972, there was a lot of fighting between the countries of Israel, Syria and Egypt. 1970 First, Palestinian terrorist organizations launch a series of attacks on Israeli and Jewish targets. The first of these was at the 1972 Olympic Games, when Palestinian terrorists held Israeli athletes hostage and killed them. In return, Israel killed many terrorists through Mossad men in what they called 'God's fault'. On October 6, 1973, the Jewish fast day of Yom Kippur, Egyptian and Syrian forces attacked suddenly and without warning. But, alarming at first, they were unable to regain the lands they lost to Israel in 1967. After the war there were years without conflict, complicity in peace talks. In 1974, after Mayr's resignation, Yitzhak Rabin became the fifth prime minister. In the 1977 Knesset elections, the March Party, which had been in power since 1948, came out of government. A new Likud party led by Menacem Begin took over the government. In November 1974, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made a historic visit to the Jewish state and addressed the Knesset, the Lok Sabha. This was the first acceptance by an Arab country of Israel. After that, talks started between the two countries and led to the threads of Camp David. In March 1979, the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty was signed in Washington. In 1967, Israel returned all the territories it had captured to Egypt. It was also agreed that the Palestinians could have autonomy. 1980s On July 7, 1981, the Israeli Air Force attacked and destroyed the Osiriq nuclear facility in Iraq. It was said that this effort was to prevent the Iraqis from making nuclear bombs. Israel attacked Lebanon in 1982. Israel invaded Lebanon, which had been in a civil war since 1975. It was initially given the pretext of protecting the residents of the north from Palestinian terrorist attacks. But 40 km. After establishing a buffer zone outside the border, Israeli forces advanced further north and captured the Lebanese capital, Beirut. After the Palestine Liberation Organization was expelled from Lebanon, they migrated to Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. Tired of the ensuing Lebanese wars, Prime Minister Begin resigned in 1983 and was replaced by Yitzhak Shamir. In 1986, the buffer zone remained in place until 2000, despite a large-scale withdrawal from Lebanon. That too was vacated in 2000. In 1980 the government alternated between left and right. In 1984 the leftist Shimon Peres became prime minister; Shamir took office again in 1986. The first Palestinian uprising (Indipada) began in 1987 and violence ensued. So Shamir was elected Prime Minister in 1988. 1990s In the gulf war, without a role, without a party, Israel was hit by several rockets and 2 civilians were killed. In 1990, large numbers of Jewish immigrants entered the then-collapsed Soviet Union. They immediately acquired Israeli citizenship rights, according to the 'justice of return'. In 1990-91, 380,000 people came and got right of residence. To woo their votes, the Labor Party lobbied against the ruling Likud on unemployment and housing issues. So the Vanderis voted in support of the Labor Party in the 1992 elections, giving the party a 61% majority in the Lok Sabha. As a result of the election, Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister and assumed a left-wing government. During the election, he promised Israelis self-defense and total peace with the Arabs within 9 months. In 1993. The government abandoned the Madrid peace talks and agreed to a peace deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization in Oslo, the Norwegian capital. Jordan thus became the second Arab country to accept Israel. Support for the peace accord, which was initially high, has been eroded by incidents of violence by opponents of the Palestinian accord, such as Hamas. On November 4, 1995. A Jewish fanatic named Igal Amir shot and killed Prime Minister Rabin. The public, outraged by the assassination, resented the opponents of the Oslo Accords and began to support Shimon Peres, the presiding officer of the accord. But with new Palestinian suicide incidents and anger over Yachar Arafat's praise of terrorism, Berech's popular support faded somewhat, and Berech lost the 1996 election to Likud candidate Binyamin Nadyagu. Despite seeming hostile to the Oslo Accords, Netanyahu signed an agreement to withdraw from the Hebron region and give further priority to the Palestinian National Council. Terrorist attacks were somewhat blunted during the Nadanya regime. But in the 1999 elections, the Labor Party defeated Ehud Barak Ndanyaku by a landslide and became the next prime minister. Land system of Israel    Israel was bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria, Jordan, and the West Bank to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest. There are beaches on the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Gulf of Aqaba to the south. In the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Before 1982, many soldiers and immigrants withdrew from China. The situation in the West Bank, Gaza Bank and Golan Heights is still undecided. The total area of ​​Israel, excluding the territories annexed in 1967, is 20,770 km² or 8,019 sq mi; (1% water). According to Israeli law the total area, including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, is 22,145 km² or 8,550 mi²; One percent water down. The total area under Israeli control is 28,023 km² or 10,820 mi² (~1% water). Metropolitan areas Tel Aviv (population 2,933,300), Haifa (population 980,600), and Beersheba (population 511,700) are the three largest cities in Israel, according to a 2004 Israel Statistics Center census.[45] Jerusalem can also be included among the cities of Israel, but the city's boundaries are fragmented, so the population cannot be accurately counted. According to the 2005 census, the population of Jerusalem was 706,368 according to the government. Sometimes Nazareth is also mentioned as a city with a majority Arab Muslim population. . Legislature  Israel is governed by a single legislature. The National Assembly of Israel is called the Knesset (Knesset in Hebrew, קנשת = meeting, forum, assembly). It has 120 Knesset members (Members of Parliament). Government payers The President of the Israeli Republic is the head of state, but does not have much administrative responsibility and the right to command and command. One of the main responsibilities of the President is to choose the leader of the party who won the majority in the election as the Chief Minister. The responsibility and authority to run the country belongs to the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister will run the country with his cabinet. People Classification of people According to a May 2006 estimate by Israel's Department of Central Statistics, there are 7 million in Israel. 77% of them are Jews, 18.5% are Arabs, and 4.3% are of other ethnicities.[46] 68% of Jews were born in Israel (called sabara), or immigrated from Europe (called olim), 22% immigrated from Europe and the Americas, and 10% immigrated from Asia-Africa.[47] Sources and Citations  Note  External links  Government  at the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Israel Tourism Ministry of the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics  General information  at The Washington Post at the Jewish Virtual Library from International Futures Maps Wikimedia Atlas of Israel Details at Curlie   Category:Israel Category:Former British Colonies Category:Member States of the United Nations ",Which is the capital of Israel?,Jerusalem,1995
"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (or North Korea in general) is a country located in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula in East Asia. Its largest city and capital is Pyongyang. To its north lies China and Russia. To the south lies South Korea. In 1948, the country was separated from Korea. It gained independence from Japan on August 15, 1945, after World War II. However, there is still a border dispute between the two countries. With 1.21 million soldiers, it has the 4th largest military in the world after China, the United States, and India. . History BC In 2333, the first Korean government was established by Gojoseon Dangun. It extended to the northern Korean peninsula and parts of Manchuria. It is said in Chinese chronicles in the 7th century. After many conflicts with the Chinese Han tradition, the Gojojeon state disintegrated.Korea split into three kingdoms: Goguryeo in the north, Baekje and Silla in the south. In 372, Buddhism was adopted as the official religion of the Goguryeo state. AD In the 5th century it reached a great position through many wars with China and Chinese invasions. Declined by civil succession wars in the 7th century The rest of the country was united under the rule of the unified Silla nation in 676. Korea and China had very peaceful relations during this period. It lasted until the period between 7th-10th centuries. It was badly affected by the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. After the fall of the Mongol Empire in 1388, the Joseon dynasty established itself. In 1394, the capital was moved to southern Hanyang (present-day Seoul) following political unrest in the Joseon Kingdom. In the period from 1592–1598, Japan twice repulsed an invasion of Korea. In the 17th-19th centuries it became an independent state dependent on China. A trade treaty was signed between Korea and Japan in 1871 after 243 Korean soldiers were killed in a battle with American forces on Ganghwa Island. In 1910, Korea came under the control of the Empire of Japan. Japanese rule ended after Japan surrendered at the end of World War II North and South Korea were divided in 1948. The Korean War ended in 1950 and an armistice was signed in 1953. In 1991, both countries were recognized by the United Nations. time Buddhism is the common religion of both Koreas. Confucianism and Christianity are also practiced. 64.3 percent were non-religious, 16 percent followed Korean Shamanism, 13.5 percent Chondoism, 4.5 percent Buddhism, and 1.7 percent Christianity.

"Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564[3] – 8 January 1642) was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, engineer, and philosopher. He played a leading role in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. Galileo has been proudly called the ""Father of Objective Astronomy"",[4] the ""Father of Modern Physics"",[5][6] the ""Father of Modern Science""[7]. His major contributions to astronomical astronomy were the observation of the different faces of Venus through a telescope, the discovery of the four great moons of Jupiter (known as the Moons of Galilee in his honour), the observation and exploration of the sunspots. Galileo was involved in applied science and technology and invented various instruments including an improved military compass. Galileo's heliocentric theory was not accepted by others during his lifetime. Many astronomers opposed this theory. At the time, most astronomers accepted the geocentric principle or the Tychonic system.[8] Galileo later provided much evidence for his heliocentric theory in his ""Dialogues on Two Primary Worldviews"". But as it appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII, Bullan was interrogated and placed under house arrest. Galileo spent the rest of his life under house arrest.[9][10] It was while under house arrest that Galileo wrote one of his greatest works and his final work, Two New Sciences. In this book he compiled the studies he conducted forty years earlier in the fields now known as dialectics and the strength of materials.[11][12] Youth and family Galileo was born in Pisa, Italy (then in the Principality of Florence) in 1564;[1] the first of six children born to Vincenzo Galileo, a renowned flutist and composer, and Giulia Ammanati. He learned pipe music from his father. Doubts about more established theories from the father,[13] must have gripped the value of well-defined experimental results, the conclusions that mathematics and experiment produce together. Of the five children born to Galileo, only three survived puberty. The much younger Michelangelo was gifted on the flute; He was responsible for the financial problems of Galileo's youth. Michelangelo faced legal cases where his wife was unable to pay the family the dowry promised by her father. He also wanted to borrow from Galileo for his musical endeavors and tours. This financial need must have motivated Galileo to innovate and generate additional revenue. When Galileo Galilei was eight, his family moved to Florence, and he was left with Jacopo Borghini for two years.[1] Then 35 km southeast of Florence. Camaldolese was educated at the monastery in the distant Vallamburosa.[1] Name The family name Galileo is derived from the name of an ancestor, Galileo Bonaluti, who was a physician in Florence from 1370 to 1450 AD. Bonaluti was a university teacher and politician; His descendants changed the surname from Bonaluti to Galilee from the 14th century to honor him.[14] Galileo Bonaluti is buried 200 years later in the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, the same church cemetery where his famous progenitor (successor) Galileo Galilei was buried. In the mid-sixteenth century it was common practice in Tasukan families for the eldest son to take his father's name as his surname [15] – so his name was not necessarily derived from the ancestral name Galileo Bonaluti. Galileo may have been given an Italian surname. (Also the family name may have been named after Galilee, a city in northern Israel that was biblically famous at the time, Galileus in Latin means belonging to Galilee)..[16][17] The biblical roots of his name and surname led to bilingualism in the following Galileo-related event in 1614.[18] One of Galileo's opponents, the Dominican priest Tommaso Caccini, delivered a highly influential sermon against Galileo. In Acts 1:11 from the Bible, ""Men of Galilee, why do you come to heaven and wake up?"" [19] Children  Although a devout Roman Catholic,[20] Galileo remained celibate with Marina Campa and fathered three children. They had twin daughters Virginia (b. 1600) and Ilivia (b. 1601) and a son, Vincenzo Gamba (b. 1606).[21] He considered both his daughters ineligible for marriage as they were born against the law. If not, she had to accept the financial burden of reparation as her siblings did. [22] Instead, women's lives were religious lives. Both women were accepted as virgins by the Convent of San Mateo in Arcetri. They spent their entire lives there.[23] At the monastery she took the name Virginia Maria Celeste. She took the name Ilivia Archangela. Maria died on 2 April 1634. He was buried with Galileo in the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence. Iliviao has lived without health all her life. Vincenzo was later accepted as Galileo's legitimate son and married Cesutilla Bocchineri.[24] As a scientist Galileo first enrolled in medicine at the University of Pisa.[25] In 1581, while he was studying medicine, he noticed one day that the windings made the chandelier swing in large and small oscillations like a single pendulum. As he monitored his heart rate, he saw that the chandelier was taking one wave at the same time in the big wave and the small wave. On returning to his home, he saw two separate pendulums of the same length swinging at different rates and observed that they both oscillated at the same time. It was only after this that Christian Isaacson developed a precision clock using this principle. So far in his life he has stayed away from studying mathematics. Because at that time a mathematician was able to earn less money than a physicist. But after hearing a lecture on geometry he convinced his father to study mathematics. He later developed a prototype of the thermometer. In 1586 he published a book on the hydrological balance he had discovered. This was his first introduction to the world of science. In 1589, he was appointed professor for the ""Mathematical Chair"" of the University of Pisa. In 1591 Galileo's father died. So the younger brother also took on the responsibility of looking after Michelangelo. In 1592, Galileo joined the University of Padua, where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period Galileo made many discoveries in both the pure basic sciences (e.g., mechanics, astronomy) and the applied sciences (e.g., the strength of materials, improvements in the telescope). Galileo and Kepler's Theory of Reading  Archbishop Bellarmine Copernicus stated in 1615 that ""if Copernicus' heliocentric theory is to be objectively established, it must first be established objectively that the sun does not revolve around the earth, but rather that the earth revolves around the sun"". He changed the title of his book to A Dialogue on the Sea of ​​Fire and Flow.[27] The sea quote was removed from the title after Galileo's death. The ups and downs of the earth's rotation as it revolves around the sun on its tilted axis, according to Galileo, creates tidal currents. He first presented his theory of eddies to Archbishop Orsini in 1616. [28] His theory was the first to explain the formation and timing of eddies. The effect is well explained; He correctly described the absence of otam in the middle of the Adriatic and the formation of otam at the ends. However, it failed as a general principle for recitations. If this theory is correct, a high temperature should occur in one day. Galileo and others were aware of the present. Venice was known to have two recitations a day, 12 hours apart. Galileo ignored this variation and said that it was caused by other factors such as the shape of the sea, the ocean. [29] Einstein confirmed that these arguments of Galileo were false, and published the opinion that Galileo made these elegant arguments without proof to establish the rotation of the earth objectively.[30] Galileo ignored his contemporary Johannes Kepler's suggestion that the moon's gravity caused ocean currents.[31] (Also Galileo was not interested in Kepler's elliptical orbits of the planets.)[32][33] Contradiction and evaluation thread on comets Galileo clashed with Horazio Grazi, professor of mathematics at the Roman College of Jesus, in 1619. What began as a debate over the nature of comets, and when Galileo published his Estimator in 1623, eventually expanded into a controversy over the nature of science. The first page of the book mentions him as the principal mathematician and philosopher of the Dasukani Empire. Because of Galileo's rich ideas on scientific practice, the Estimator is considered his scientific policy statement.[34] In early 1619, Father Grassi published anonymously the pamphlet Astronomical Discourse on the Three Comets of 1618.[35] It analyzed the nature of the comet that appeared in November of the previous year. In it, Grassi concluded that a comet is a fiery meteor that travels in a great circle at a constant distance from Earth.[36] He also declared that it should be located at a longer distance than the moon as it moves slower than the moon. Paradox of heliocentric position  Death He was placed under house arrest by the Catholic Church from 1642 until his death for publicizing the truth against the Christian belief that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. He later developed a fever and heart failure and died on 8 January 1642 at the age of 77.[11][37] Emperor Ferdinand II of Dasukani wanted to be buried in the main section of the Basilica of Santa Croce, where his father and predecessors are buried, and to erect a laundromat.[38]  The project was abandoned due to the opposition of Pope Urban VIII and Archbishop Francesco Barberini, as Galileo was condemned by the Catholic Church for his radicalism.[39][40] Alternatively, he was buried in a small chamber near the Novices cemetery near the southern transept of the basilica to the sacristy.[41] His entire body was reburied there in 1737 after a monument was erected in his honor in the basilica cemetery;[42] three fingers and a tooth were removed from his body.[43] One of the three, the right middle finger, is now housed in the Galileo Museum in Florence.[44] Scientific methods Galileo made major contributions to the science of motion through this innovative combination of methods and mathematics.[45] The nature of science at the time was marked by William Gilbert's characteristic studies of magnetism and electricity. The musician and music theorist Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galileo, was the first to discover and publish a nonlinear relationship in physics: he established the square (concave or quadratic) root of the tension of a stretched string (wire).[46] Galileo was the first scientist to clearly explain the laws of physics mathematically. Astronomy Galileo built a telescope with 3x magnification in 1609. He later developed telescopes with up to 30x magnification.[47] With a Galilean telescope the viewer can see large upright images. Galileo used it to study the heavens. He was one of the very few who could make good telescopes for this requirement at the time. On 25 August 1609, he described his telescope, which had a magnification of about 8 or 9, to the legislators of Venice. Galileo made money by selling his telescopes to merchants. Those traders saw the telescopes as useful at sea. He published his early telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a small treatise entitled Citrus Nuncius (Messenger of the Constellations). Thursday On 7 January 1610 Galileo saw three stars near Jupiter. During the following nights he observed that these ""stars"" were moving relative to Jupiter and therefore concluded that they were not fixed stars. On 10 January he noticed that one of them had disappeared. He thought it must be hidden behind Jupiter. So he saw that all three must be moons of Jupiter. He found the moon of fourth Jupiter on 13th January. Later astronomers named these four phases the Galilean moons in his honor. These moons are now known as Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callichtho. His observations of Jupiter revolutionized astronomy. Because till then Aristotle's idea that all astronomical objects revolved around the earth was prevailing in the world. And at first many astronomers refused to believe it. His studies were confirmed by the Christopher Clavius ​​Institute. He then received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611.[48] Galileo continued to observe the satellites for the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates of them. Kepler thought such a thing impossible. Sunspots Galileo was one of the first Europeans to observe sunspots. Kepler unwittingly discovered this in 1607. But then he mistook it for Mercury. He made an observation that had previously been mistakenly attributed to Mercury in Charlemagne's time as actually being a black spot on the Sun. The displacement of sunspots supported Kepler's claim that the sun rotates. And Francesco Sicchi's observations of the black spot disproved Ptolemy's astronomical claims. the moon Through his telescope Thomas Harriot (an English mathematician and explorer) had already observed that light on the moon did not spread as it would have if it had been a perfect sphere. But due to his ignorance he did not understand it properly. Galileo understood the changes in the distribution of light to be precisely the moon's hills and pits. In his study he drew topological maps of the moon. He also predicted the height of Nila's mountains. It was then discovered that the moon was not a perfect sphere as Aristotle had long claimed. Venus, Saturn, and Neptune  Beginning in September 1610, Galileo observed that Venus displayed similar dimensions to the moon. The heliocentric model developed by Nicolaus Copernicus states that Venus revolves around the Sun, allowing us to see all its moon-like dimensions. But this cannot be explained by Ptolemy's geocentric model. Thus, the earth-centered principle was destroyed by this. However, this can be explained by a half heliocentric and half heliocentric principle without the need for full heliocentricity. So many astronomers first switched to the half-heliocentric and half-heliocentric principle and then to the fully heliocentric principle as a result of other arguments. Galileo observed Saturn and, at first, mistook its rings for planets. Galileo saw the planet Neptune in 1612. It was listed in his manuals as one of the faintest stars. He didn't know it was a planet, but he had made the observation that it was moving relative to the stars before he lost track of it. Technology  Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo developed a geometric and military compass. For soldiers it was used not only to accurately raise cannons but also to determine how much explosives were needed. In 1593 Galileo invented a thermometer. He made this possible by using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to create movement in water in a tube attached to it. Falling items Galileo's student Vincenzo Viviani wrote a biography of Galileo. In it he dropped objects of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and showed that they both take the same time to come down. This disproved Aristotle's claim that the time it takes objects to fall is proportional to their weight. Galileo hypothesized that when an object falls in a vacuum, it falls with uniform velocity. And Galileo correctly predicted the law of motion (d ∝ t 2 ) for an object starting from rest and proceeding with uniform acceleration. He also made many contributions in the pure fields of physics and mathematics.

"Alexander the Great (Greek: Αλέξανδρος ο Μέγας or Μέγας Aλέξανδρος,[1] Megas Alexandros; July 20, 356 BC – June 10/11, 323 BC), was the emperor of Macedon, a part of Greece[2][3]. (336–323 BC). He is also known as Alexander III of Macedon. He is hailed as one of the most successful military leaders in world history. It is also said that he never failed in any battle he participated in. During his time he conquered and ruled most of the world known to the ancient Greeks. Alexander was crowned king of Macedon after the death of his father, Philip II. King Philip united many cities from the ancient Greek mainland under Macedonian rule. Alexander conquered the southern Greek cities and brought them under Macedonian rule. Later the Achaemenid Persian Empire conquered the east. He not only conquered Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Gaza, Egypt, Persia, Bactria and Mesopotamia but also extended the boundaries of his empire to Punjab, India. Before his death, he planned to expand his commercial activities and military operations into the Arabian Peninsula. After this he had plans to move west towards Carthage, Rome and the Iberian Peninsula. Alexander had recruited many foreigners into his army. Because of this, some scholars said that he followed the principle of attachment. He encouraged his soldiers to marry women from other countries. He also courted two foreign princesses. Alexander died after twelve years of continuous military operations. The cause of his death is not clear. It is believed to have died from something like malaria, neutering, typhoid fever, a viral infection, or from excessive drinking. Alexander's expansions and legacy continued long after his death, helping Greek settlements and cultural influence last for centuries in far-flung places. This period is known as the Hellenic period and it was a hybrid culture of Greece, Middle East and India. Initial period Heredity and childhood Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek calendar month Hegatompion (approximately July 6, 356 BC in the current calendar) in Pella, the capital of Macedon in the ancient Greek Empire, to Olympias and Philippa, the fourth wife of his father Philip II. Her mother Olympias' father was King Neoptolemus of Epirus. Although his father Philip II had seven or eight wives, he had only a legal heir through his mother, Olympias. According to the ancient Greek historian Plutarch, Alexander's family was surrounded by knights of various eras. During Alexander's youth he was raised by a nurse. Alexander and his sister Lanaike, who would later command his army as Clytus the Black, were tutored by their mother, Olympias' cousin, Leonidas. Alexander the Macedonian grew up to be a tender youth. He was skilled in hunting, learning, fighting, and hunting. When Alexander was ten years old, a merchant from Decali tried to sell his father a horse. Then his father Philip realized that the horse was too rude to belong to anyone and wanted to send it outside instead of buying it. Alexander, who was present at that moment, found that the horse was frightened by his own shadow. He also said that he would train the horse himself. As said, he tamed it and made it habituated. Plutarch praises this in great detail in his note. Plutarch explains that King Philip told his son Alexander, ""Son, you will surely conquer the world, and Macedon is too small for you."" He also gave the horse as a gift to Alexander himself. Alexander named the horse Bucephalus (ox-head). It was the horse Bucyphalas that carried the hero Alexander through the wars to the Indian subcontinent. Later, after the horse died of old age (in his 30s), Alexander named a city Bucephala in his honor. Adolescence and education  As early as the age of 13, Alexander's father appointed great scholars like Isocrates and Speucippus to tutor him. After them, King Philip II appointed Aristotle to teach. He gave the temple of Nimbus at Mysa as a classroom for teaching. Alexander agreed to rebuild Stagira, his teacher Aristotle's home city, which he had destroyed on his return from education. He also promised to settle the people there and free the people who were separated as slaves from there. The Temple of Mysa was like a board school attended by Alexander and the children of the Macedonian aristocracy, as were places like Ptolemy, Hephaizon and Cassander. Many of his students later became Alexander's close friends and trusted government officials. And some are known to have been consorts as well. Aristotle instructed Alexander and all his companions in medicine, philosophy, ethics, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage Alexander had improved in subjects such as knowing the countries in all directions around him. In particular, Aristotle made Alexander an expert on the study of states in vector. That knowledge later led Alexander to conquer the entire world. Heir to Philip II and rise as ruler of Macedon  Alexander finished his education with Aristotle at the age of 16. Having won the succession contest with King Philip of Byzantium, Alexander was declared the sole heir apparent. During Philip's absence the Thracians invaded Macedon. Alexander immediately retaliated. He drove them away from his territory. He then planted colonial dominance in Greece. Not only that, he also built a city called Alexandropolis. Then Philip returned and sent Alexander at the head of a small force to conquer southern Thrace. Alexander saved his father's life in a battle against the Greek city of Perinthus. Following this he won many battles in Greece under the guidance of his father. Some time later, in 338 BC, Alexander's forces joined forces with those of his father, Philip II. And they crawled through southern Thermopylae. Later, after defeating the Theban garrison, they conquered Thebes and the city of Aeladia, a few days' journey from Athens. Later, Athens and Thebes, ruled by Timosthenes, tried to conquer Macedonia. Meanwhile Philip and Athens camped at Thebes and tried to win. But Athens won this match. Then Philip went to Ambicha. As Philip moved south, his enemies surrounded and attacked him in the Caronian region. In the battle that took place, Alexander effectively led the army on the right and his father on the left, and with the help of trusted generals, they won the battle. After winning the Caronian War, Philip and Alexander conquered the unopposed Peloponnese. Then they were welcomed in all the neighboring cities until they reached Sparta. Philip united all the cities he conquered except Sparta to form a Hellenic federation. Later he named it the Hegemon Confederation. He also commissioned the confederation to invade the Persian Empire. Deportation and return Philip returned to Bella and married a woman named Cleopatra Eurydice. Alexander's position as Philip's heir was diminished by this marriage, as Alexander's mother was not of Bella. This resulted in the fact that only a child born to Cleopatra or a male relative of hers could ascend the throne. Meanwhile, Attalus, Philip's cousin and his general, got drunk during the wedding feast and prayed for the rightful heir to the throne. As this problem grew bigger and bigger, Alexander was harassed by the conspirators and Alexander, who was a prince, left his native Macedon. He left his mother at the house of his brother, King Alexander I of Epirus, at Dodona, head of the Molossians, and continued on his journey. On his journey he sought refuge with the Illyrian king, who treated him as a guest even though Alexander had come as a refugee from the Illyrian king, who had been defeated by Alexander's troops some years earlier. By this time King Philip had made no attempt to rescue his son, who had passed all military training. Meanwhile, Alexander returned to Macedonia six months later through the efforts of Demaratus-Corinthian, a family friend of Alexander's. In the following years the governor of Caria in Persia offered his daughter in marriage to Alexander's brother Philip Aredias. It appeared to Alexander and his mother Olympias and Alexander's friends that King Philip II was considering another of his nobles, Ardias, as his next heir to the throne. Alexander thus intended to forbid this marriage arrangement by sending an emissary. He tried to marry the girl himself instead of Aridias. When King Philip II learned of this, he reprimanded Prince Alexander for trying to woo the daughter of the governor of Caria. And he told Alexander that he thought of marrying a woman in a better place than this. As a result, the king exiled four of Alexander's friends (Harbalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy, and Ericaeus). As king of Macedon Succession  King Philip II was assassinated by his bodyguard (Pasanias) in 336 BC at the wedding of Cleopatra, daughter of Alexander I of Ephraim, Olympias' brother, in AK. Later, as he tried to escape, he and Alexander's dead companions (Perticcas and Leonatus) were caught and killed by the guards. After this, Alexander ascended the throne as king at the age of 20. Integration of strength Alexander began a great reign as a single man, defeating all his rivals for the throne. Alexander lost his cousin Amyndas IV in this. And Lyncestis had to lose the two Macedonian princes who were subject to it. And Alexander, along with Olympias, killed Cleopatra, Attalus, and others in the contest. The news of King Philip's death caused great uproar in Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes, as well as northern Macedon. Hearing of this revolt, Alexander immediately took measures in response. Combining cunning and efficiency, Alexander marched towards Desali with 3000 cavalry. He was then surrounded by the Thracian forces between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa. Alexander then ordered his forces to pass over the Ossa mountains. The next morning the Thracian forces awoke to find that Alexander's forces, which they had surrounded, were now encircled. Then, joining their cavalry with his own, he marched from there to the Peloponnese. On the way, Alexander stopped at Thermopylae and was recognized as the leader of the Ambitionic League there. He then advanced towards Corinth. Athens also quietly bowed to Alexander. Alexander also pardoned the tribes. Alexander's epic battle with the Cynic Diogenes took place while Alexander was in Corinth. When Alexander Diogenes, who won the war, asked him what do you want, the plaintiffs replied with mockery to Alexander. They told us that you should stand a little further away because the sun is not shining on us. This answer stunned Alexander. Instead Alexander told them that if I were not Alexander I would rather be a Diogenes. It was at Corinth that Alexander was given the title HEGEMON, meaning leader who leads like his father Philip. And it was after this that the Thracian War and the Persian War were fought by Alexander. Balkan Umbrella Wars Alexander intended to fortify his northern provincial borders before campaigning in Asia. During the spring of 335 BC he carried out various invasions. Traveling eastward from Amphipolis, he defeated the independent Thrace at Mount Haemus, Dripalli, near the Lyginus River on the Danube, and the Caete tribes in a coastal battle. Then in Clydus he put down in battle the revolt of the Illyrian king, and Clugias of Talenti. He turned them away from the battle with their armies. With these victories Alexander established a defense of unparalleled strength on the northern frontiers. While Alexander was waging war in the north, Thebes and Athens once again sowed rebellion. Alexander immediately rushed to the south and defeated Thebes. The attack of Thebes in this battle was not remarkable. And Alexander dismembered that nation. Frightened by this decision of Thebes, Athens fled from Greece. This temporarily brought peace to Greece. After placing Antipeter in charge, Alexander began to travel towards Asia. Conquests in the Persian Empire Cinnacia  Alexander's army crossed the Hellespont from Macedon through various Greek states in 334 BC with approximately 48,100 infantry, 6,100 cavalry and 38,000 naval men in 120 ships. Alexander planted his person on Asian soil through Persia with a huge army along Thrus, Paeonia, and Illyria. He also considered Asia as a gift from God. This explains Alexander's penchant for war. Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provinces at Halicarnassus after his first victory at Chronicle of Persia. He entrusted the administration of the kingdom of Caria to Ada, chosen by Alexander. From Halicarnassus, Alexander traveled through the hill country of Lycia and Pamphylia. He conquered all the countries in sight. He destroyed all the Persian naval bases. After conquering the coasts from Pamphylia, he advanced rapidly inland. Levant and Syria  After a long campaign in Asia, Alexander's army passed through the Cilician Gate in 333 BC and defeated the main Persian forces of Darius III at the Battle of Issus in November. In this battle Darius retreated with his wife and daughters dead and his forces were decimated. Darius thus lost his mother Sisicambis and his immense wealth.  Alexander then advanced towards Syria. He also conquered most of the Levant coastal states. Then in 332 BC he conquered Tire after a long battle. He then killed the prisoners captured in the war and sold their wives and children to slave traders. Egypt  After conquering Tyre, Alexander easily conquered all the Egyptian kingdoms in his way except Gajah. The city was built on the heavily fortified Gaja hills. Alexander had to fight hard to win it. After three successful surprise attacks, its strength weakened and Gaja fell. Never before this battle had Alexander been so seriously wounded as he was at this battle. Likewise, Jerusalem surrendered to Alexander without a fight. Alexander entered Egypt in 332 BC. There they respected Alexander as a warrior who came to liberate him. There he felt himself as the leader of the universe. They sinned as sons of God. It was only after this that Alexander often referred to the god Siusu-Ammon as his father. And he also issued coins with improved designs. During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria, which was built in Egypt. It later became the head of the Ptolemaic Empire after his death. Assyria and Babylonia Alexander left Egypt in 331 BC and traveled eastward to Mesopotamia (present-day northern Iraq). There he defeated Darius again in a battle at Cugamela. In that battle too, Darius ran away from the battlefield. This time Alexander chased Darius up to the Arabella range. The fight here at Kugamela was the last fight between the two. When Alexander conquered Babylon, Darius escaped the battle and fled across the Ecbatana mountain range. Persia From Babylon Alexander moved to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals. He amassed great wealth there. He sent the bulk of his army to Persia, the famous capital of Persia. Alexander himself led and selected the regiments for the expedition. And he took the city and the treasury there like a whirlwind. After he entered Persepolis he allowed his soldiers to plunder the city for several days. Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. While he was staying there, the East Sarsesh mansion also left behind ashes in that moving fire. There were two other reasons for the fire: an accident at the tavern and revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War. The Fall of the Empire and the East  Alexander drove Darius first from Media and then from Parthia. After that the Persian king was arrested and taken away by a royal named Bessus. They later announced that the person they had taken and killed was King Darius. Artaxerxes V, who later fought with Alexander in guerrilla warfare in Central Asia and retreated, was the king of the Pessus kingdom. Alexander cremated Darius and allowed his Achaemenid successors to perform his funeral rites. At the time of Darius' death the Achaemenid throne had been named after him. This is what the Achaemenid rulers considered the cause of the downfall of all who ascended the throne after that. Macedon in Alexander's absence Philip II's old guard wrested the throne of Macedon from Antipeter because of Alexander's long stay in Asia after placing Antipeter in charge. With Alexander Thebes out of the country, Greece again became dominant. Instead, King Agis III of Sparta defeated and killed Antipater at the Battle of Megalopolis. Antipeter referred to this as a punishment given to King Alexander of Sparta. And there was also resentment between Antipater and Alexander's mother, Olympias. One by one they reported this to Alexander. On the whole Greece had returned to its former state of independence and peace in Alexander's absence. Many of the countries he had conquered were left by Alexander himself at will. By this time many of the soldiers who were with him were very tired. However, they obeyed Alexander's command and continued to travel with him from Macedonia. The long journey and continuous battles had left them very tired. He sent many of them back to Rome. He kept with him only those who were ambitious. Indian invasion  Alexander's invasion of the Indian subcontinent After the death of Spitamenes and his death with Roxana (Roshanak of the Bactrian race), Alexander turned his attention to the Indian subcontinent. Alexander traveled there at the invitation of the former governor and leader of the tribes of the country of Gandhara (present-day northern Pakistan). Ombis, the king of the then Duxsilla kingdom that stretched from the Indus to the Hydaspus, some hill tribes, and the Aspasioi and Assakenoi refused to serve Alexander's friend. In the winters of 327/326 BC Alexander himself led a war with the hill tribes. He fought the Aspasioi in the Kunar Plain, the Swat and the Assakenoi in the Punar Plain. In all these Alexander easily won, but his shoulder was wounded when he fought with Ospasioi. Fighting the powerful Assakenoi, Alexander was able to gain victory after bloody battles at fortresses such as Ora and Ornos. Alexander's ankle was seriously injured in the fight. According to Curitus, Alexander inflicted damage similar to that of Ora, although he did not completely destroy Massaca. Massaga's tragic end left most of those present. Constantly fighting in close quarters, Alexander captured the hill forts after a bloody four-day battle. After this, Alexander crossed the Indus River and defeated the Indian king Porus, who had conquered the Punjab region in a historic battle. Alexander's troops, who had never seen elephants for the first time, were awestruck and took a step back for the first time. At the Hydaspes in 326 BC, King Alexander was amazed by the bravery of Porus and befriended Porus. And he appointed Borus himself as satrap of the regions which he had hitherto come under, and brought under his control the regions which had not been under his rule. Since these lands were so far from Greece that he could not take care of them, he honored a large part of this region by appointing him as his representative under the rule of Porus. Alexander built two cities on either bank of the Hydaspes, one of which he named Bucyphala after his horse, which died at this time. Another city named Nisia (Victory) is the Mang region of present day Punjab state of Pakistan.  A military coup in Alexander's army The Nanda Kingdom of Magadha and the Gangaritai Kingdom of Bengal, east of King Porus's empire, feared that Alexander's massive forces would next target them eastwards. Meanwhile, a skirmish broke out in Alexander's army on the banks of the Hyphasis River. They were not ready to travel further east. This river was the boundary of Alexander's eastern direction. At the same time, the Macedonian soldiers, whose ambition had subsided and were tired, remained there. Because of this, when Alexander forced them to cross the river Ganges, they strongly hated Alexander. And they refused to move further because many people would die in crossing this river and because on the other side the kings like Kanderi and Bracy had a huge army of eighty thousand cavalry, two hundred thousand foot soldiers, eight thousand cavalry and six thousand elephants. However, Alexander prepared the soldiers to advance further. But his general, Coenus, argued with Alexander and changed his mind. He told the commander Alexander that our soldiers had been separated from their parents, wives and children for many years and that they should be allowed to spend the remaining days of their lives in peace. He also discussed that everyone should be allowed to return to their homeland. Alexander eventually agreed to turn south. On his way back across the Indus he encountered the Malli hill people (present-day Multan) and some other Indian tribes. Alexander sent the bulk of his army to Carmania (present-day southern Iran) under his general Crateras. and sent his fleet to the Persian Gulf under the command of his naval officer Nearchus. Taking the rest of the army himself, he led southward through the fierce Catrosian milk land and marched into Persia. By the time he reached Susa in 324 BC, he had lost more of his army than ever before to the cruelty of the desert. Alexander in late times in Persia  During his absence, Alexander found many of the despotic governors and satraps he had installed in charge of excesses and executed many of them. And gave credit to his players. And he announced that Craterus would return to Macedon as a weak warrior past Valipum. His soldiers misconstrued the claim and joined the League at Obis Nagar. They failed to respect the sovereignty of Persia. Three days later Alexander, disgusted by the intransigent League, announced that the units provided by the Macedonians could be followed in Persia. After this the Macedonians realized their mistake and apologized. Alexander also forgave. Tens of thousands of people dined together at the banquet given by him. In an attempt to make peace between the Persians and the Macedonians, Alexander married someone from a Persian clan. After returning to Ecbatana, Alexander recovered the Persian treasury. His close confidante, Hebesion, died mysteriously. Alexander was heartbroken because there was evidence that he had died without a cure but had been strangled. Alexander was devastated by the death of Hephaestus. And he ordered the Eemasat of Hephesus, a companion and companion, to make arrangements at great expense in Babylon. After this, Alexander again planned a large-scale war. But he died before starting all of them. death On June 10 or 11, 323 BC, at the age of 32, Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II in Babylon. However, the date of his death is still debated even today. Alexander's own relationships Most of Alexander's life was spent with his companion, confidante, bodyguard, and general, Hebesion. Hephaestus' death brought Alexander to his final days. It was this event that led to his declining health and mental breakdown in his later years. Alexander was married twice. He married Rokshana (daughter of Bactrian Manchus), and Statira II, daughter of the Persian king Darius III. He also had two sons. Alexander IV of Macedon as direct legitimate heir through Roxana, and Heracles of Macedon through Parshine. And he lost one of his sons, Rokshana, through carelessness while in Babylon. Much debate continues about Alexander's parentage. No ancient record mentions Alexander as gay or his relationship with Hebesion as sexual. At the same time, Aeolian mentions in his writings the event that occurred during Alexander's entry into Troy as follows. Alexander garlanded the statue of Achilleus and the statue of Patroculus of Hephesus  Apart from this, no vulgar references are found in the references to ancient Greek culture. However, this word does not necessarily mean that only lust is taken. Perhaps Alexander was bisexual. That was not wrong with Greek culture in his time And he did not produce a successor of his own till near his end. And Octane suggests that Alexander's quest for women was far greater than that of his father. Apart from wives, Alexander had many female connections. And Alexander built palaces for himself according to the custom of the Persian kings, and filled them with innumerable women. But he rarely spent time with them. Alexander lived with great self-restraint in this sensual matter. Despite this, Plutarch mentions that Alexander was infatuated with Roxana. He drinks that he gave love only to her. Green suggests the same, noting that Alexander befriended many women, starting with Ada of Caria, who had adopted him, and Sisycumbis, mother of Darius, who died of grief at the news of Alexander's death. Alexander's generals Seleucus Nikather Ptolemy Sothar Lysimachus Antigonus Sasander After Alexander   After Alexander's death, Alexander IV ruled the Greek Empire for 13 years. After the First War of Succession in 311 BC, Alexander's friend and general, Seleucus Niccatar, was crowned king of the Greek Empire in West Asia in 305 BC. In 305 BC Ptolemy Sotdar established the Ptolemaic Empire in North Africa. Later, Alexander's other generals, Lysimachus, Antigonus, and Xander, conquered the European parts of the Greek Empire.

"Radium is a radioactive element with the atomic formula Ra. Its atomic number is 88. Its atomic mass is 226. Radium is the sixth element in column 2 of the periodic table. It is also classified as an alkaline metal. Pure radium is white in color like silver. But when exposed to air, radium readily reacts with nitrogen instead of oxygen to form a black surface layer called radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive. Among these, the most stable isotope is radium-226. Its half-life is 1600 years. This isotope decays radioactively into radon gas, specifically the isotope radon-222. Ionizing radiation is a byproduct when radium decays. It oxidizes the luminescent chemicals and produces radioluminescence. Radium in the form of radium chloride was discovered in 1898 by Maricuri and Pierrecuri. Radium was isolated from the mineral uranite at the French Academy of Sciences and published five days later. Marie Curie and Anne-Louis DePierre produced radium in its metallic state in 1911 by electrolysis of radium chloride.[1] In nature, radium is found in trace amounts in the minerals uranium and thorium. Radium is not an essential requirement for living organisms. Due to its radioactive and chemical reactivity, adverse health effects may occur when combined with biochemical processes. Radium has no commercial uses other than nuclear medicine. Earlier it was used as a radiation source for radiation devices. It is also considered a decongestant and has been used in radiopharmaceuticals. Radium is not used for such applications today. Because the toxicity of radium is realized today. So less toxic isotopes are used in these devices. Properties Radium is the heaviest of the known alkaline earth metals. And it is the only radioactive metal in that group. The physical and chemical properties of radium are similar to those of the element barium. Pure radium is a volatile element. It is white like silver, although calcium, isudrontium, and barium, which are considered to be its light co-elements, have a slight yellow tint. Its color fades quickly in air. Radium nitride reacts with air to form a black film on its surface. The melting point of radium can be either 700°C or 960°C. And its boiling point is 1737 degrees Celsius. Both of these quantities are smaller than barium. These quantities are also subject to periodic trends in the periodic table[2]. The elements of Group 2 show the same trend as we go from top to bottom of the table. Like barium and the alkali metals, radium crystallizes in a material-centered cubic form at normal temperature and pressure. The bond distance of a radium-radium bond is 514.8 picometres. Its density is 5.5 g/cm3. This is greater than the density of barium. The radium-barium density ratio is comparable to the radium-barium atomic mass ratio. Because both elements crystallize in the same crystal structure. Isotopes Radium has 33 isotopes with mass numbers ranging from 202 to 234. All these are radioactive. 223Ra with a half-life of 11.4 days, 224Ra with a half-life of 3.64 days, 226Ra with a half-life of 1600 years, and 228Ra with a half-life of 5.75 years are all from the decay chain of isotopes thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 Looks natural. The isotope 223Ra originates from the isotope uranium-235, the isotope 226Ra from the isotope uranium-235, and the other two isotopes from the isotope thorium 232.

"A Shiva temple in Thanjavur, also known as Tanjai Pragatheeswarar Temple, Tanjai Periya Koil (""Big temple"") or Tanjai Peruvudayar Temple (""Peruvudayar Temple""). The temple is also a World Heritage Site. It is one of the largest temples in India[1] and one of the most architecturally impressive Indian temples. Rajaraja Cholan I built this temple in the 11th century AD [2]. Started in 1003-1004 and completed in 1010, this temple completed 1000 years in 2010.[3] This temple is the most important tourist destination of Tamil Nadu.[4] It was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1987.[5] The temple, Gangaikonda Choleswarar Temple and Tarasuram Airavadeswarar Temple are all listed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO under the name of Immortal Chola Temples.[6]  The temple is one of the 88 temples under the Thanjavur Palace Devasthanam.[7] Vocabulary Prahadeeswarar Temple is the vernacular form of Thanjav Peruvudayar Temple.[8] The temple is also known as Thanjav Periya Koil[9], Periya Koil, Irajarajeswaran Koil, Irajarajeswaram. Built by Rajaraja Chola I, the temple was initially known as Rajarajeswaram, later as Tanjore Peruvudayar Temple and as Brihadiswaram during the 17th and 18th centuries when it was ruled by the Maratha kings. History  The Chola king Arulmozhivarman, known as Rajaraja Chola I, built the Prahadeeswarar temple in Thanjavur, which is a symbol of the greatness of the Cholas, in order to fulfill the mandate given to him in his dream.[10] Construction work on the temple began in the 19th regnal year of Rajaraja I (1003–1004 AD) and was completed in his 25th regnal year (1009–1010 AD).[6][11] In the plan of the temple, the geometrical rules of symmetry and symmetry are followed.[12] Following this, the temples built for the next two centuries are proof that the Tamils ​​excelled in wealth and art during the Chola period. A new feature of Chola architecture is the multifaceted pillars with square bases.[13] A unique example of South Indian temple architecture, the temple is a testament to the Chola rule and Tamil civilization in South India and is a fine example of the Chola's prowess in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze sculpture.[14] Medieval Cholas AD From 985 to 1070 Chola art flourished and reached its peak. A large number of temples were built during the medieval Chola period. The construction of temples continued throughout the sprawling Chola Empire. Many small temples were also built during this period. Behind the idea of ​​building a large temple Rajaraja was greatly impressed by the Kailayanathar temple built by Rajasimha at Kanchi. Similarly Rajarajan, who wanted to build a temple, built a big temple in Thanjavur. It is also said that the structure of Periyakovil was modeled on the Asaleshwarar Sannidhi in Tiruvarur Thiagarajar Temple. A small brick temple built by Rajarasa at Thanjavur, Thirukkatupalli, Ilangat is the prototype. The name of the deity in Thiruvidaimarudurg temple is Mahalingam. The thought is that the idol is not as good as Rajarajan's name. There is also a story that the idea to build a lingam and a temple in accordance with the name Peruvudayar inspired the construction of this temple. structure  The chief sculptor of this temple is mentioned in the inscriptions of the temple as Kunjara Mallan Rajaraja Rama Perundhachan. The base of the temple is 5 meters (16 ft) high.[15] The single stone Nandi weighs 20 tonnes, is two meters high, six meters long and two and a half meters wide,[16] and is the second largest Nandi in India after the Lebakshi Temple Nandi.[17] The presiding deity Ilingam is 3.7 meters tall. The exterior is 240 m. x 125 m. scale.[16] Dance sculptures depicting the 108 Bharata Natya Mudras are carved into the top of the illuminations.[16] Later, the Amman sanniti was built by the Pandyas in the 13th century and the Subramanian sanniti by the Visayanagara kings, and the Vinayagar sanniti was renovated by the Maratha kings.[16] The temple was also improved by Tanjore Nayaks.[18] Temple structure  The main building is 150 feet long. The colossal Vimana rises 190 feet above the navel, with a pointed tower like the Egyptian pyramids. The height of the Lingaraja temple built at Bhubaneswar at that time was 160 feet. It is noteworthy that Rajarajeswaram surpassed even that. Later constructions of this temple include - Front Porch, Nandi Mandapam, Karuvurth Devar Temple, Amman Temple, Subramaniar Temple. Apart from these, all the other parts of this great temple are of the same period. One cannot help but admire their proud appearance and the simple nature of the integrated scheme. The Axial Mandapams, Vimana, Artha Mandapam, Mahamandapam and Great Nandi are enclosed within a circular wall of appropriate dimensions. There is a tower on the east side of this wall. A long pillared hall leads inwards along the wall. It connects 35 sub-temples. These Utkoils are built in central places in the middle of many gaps in the four directions. There is a second tower on the front side where the gate of the second outer prakaram used to be. design Researchers say that the construction method of the Egyptian pyramids is similar to that of the Tanjore and Gangaikonda Cholapura temples. Both are built with layers of selected stones and corbels. Both are designed so that the radiations of the planets are concentrated at its core. Earthquakes are not affected. The body of the kings preserved in the heap of radiations does not deteriorate. Similarly, the Audai-lingams installed in Chola temples continue to excel as temples of power and prestige. Airplane  The main plane is of the ideal type; So it's great. This is also called Matakoil in Tamil. The first example of this type is Dakshinameru-Koranganathar. It stands on a square foundation 99 feet on a side. Bed area is elongated. It is divided into five parts. The middle part is larger than the other parts. From the floor below the ground level to the peak, the canopy and the roof alternate. Pillars embedded in the wall adorn the plinth. On a plinth with a kapotam pressed with a yali figure, an upapeetha is erected on a smaller area of ​​63 feet square. Upanam with inscriptions stands as the Padma floor to receive Kumudham in a gigantic semi-circular shape with Padma floors above and below. The Kumudham is octagonally cut on the rim, while the eastern corner turns diagonally. The continent and Kapodam are shown close up. At the same height as Kumudham is found the line plane. A row of lions, on which a lion-chaser replaces the lions at the corners, and figures of captors, warriors, gaping horses and their riders. Raised to a height of 50 feet, the steep walls of the chamber follow the floor plan, and a colossal arched buttress divides the walls into two storeys. The intervening stone Tanjore Prahadeeswarar Temple was under construction. Alagi, an old lady of the Atyar clan, wanted to give charity to Shiva. The poor old lady used to give curd and buttermilk to the temple builders every day to quench their thirst until the temple was completed. Knowing this, King Arulmozhivarman (Rajarajacholan) engraves the name Alagaki on a stone weighing 80 tons so that everyone knows the Shiva Thonta of the Atyar clan matriarch and placed it on the top of the Rajagopuram. That stone is called Ichik stone. The shadow of that stone falls on Lord Prahadeeswarar. Nandi Mandapam The large Nandi in the Thanjavur temple is made of a single stone. Its height is 14 m, length 7 m, width 3 m. The Nandi Mandapam is said to have been built during the Nayak period. South of the Nandi Mandapam in the Thiruchuttu House facing north is Nandye Rajarajan who built it opposite to Peruvudaiyar. Later the Nayaks installed a large Nandi parallel to the Shiva Lingam. Nandi Keralantagan, which was originally erected, was moved to the area between the Rajarajan gates and later to Thiruchuttu House.[19] shrines Apart from the important temple enshrined in Shivalingam and its mandapams, the temples of Chandikeshwara, Amman, Nataraja, Varakhi, Subramaniyar, Ganapati and Karuvurth Devar are situated within this complex. Peruvudayar Sannidhi - Lord Shiva, known as Peruvudayar, is in the form of Linga. Rajaraja Cholan worshiped this deity as Rajarajeeswaramudayar. This trio does not have a pedestal. Periyanayaki Amman Sannidhi - The goddess of this temple is Periyanayake. It is a Pandya period construction. Karuur Siddhar Sannidhi - There is a separate sannidi dedicated to Karuur Siddhar in this temple. Varagi Amman Sannidhi – It is believed to be a Chola period construction. It is surprising that this Thiruvuru has only two arms unlike anywhere else. inscriptions Inscriptions in many places of this temple are said to explain the personal devotion of Rajarajan to this temple. It seems that not only him, but also the participation of the royal family, government officials, soldiers and the general public in the maintenance and protection of the temple. The financial requirements were met through the lands granted by the king, the revenue from the villages, and in other ways. The first inscription of the temple is proof of this. ""What we have given, what our brother has given, what our girls have given, and what the giver has given, please cut in this stone..."" Documenting not only his contribution but also the contribution of everyone else is dramatic. Here the king gives second in importance to Akan -- his elder sister Kundavai Devi. This is the best he does to the one who nurtured him and gave him his dreams. Next, the gifts given by his graduate Thandi Shakti Vidangi and his wife are listed under the word women, and the gifts given by everyone else under the word giver. It seems that priests, sculptors, Devara Odhuvars, Musicians, Dancers and other servants were appointed as required to perform the daily rituals properly in the temple. Epigraphical evidence shows that 50 oduars and 400 dance matars were present in the temple. Festivals  Brahmotsavam - Rajarajacholan birthday party Annabhishekam Tiruvadhirai Adipuram Karthikai presentation Shivratri Chariot The specialty of Tanjore Great Temple The height of the temple's flight is 216 feet (66 m).[20] At a time when temples were built with only two or three storeys, Rajarajan built a stone temple with 15 storeys and a height of about 60 m in the Cauvery plains where no stones were available. Such a huge temple was completed in about 7 years The Shivalinga in the sanctum sanctorum is the largest Shivalinga in the world. 6 feet high, 54 feet circumference Audaiyar and 23 half feet high lingam are individually carved out of black stone and joined together. The height and width of the colossal Nandi statue at the entrance of this temple are: 13 feet and 16 feet respectively.[10] Some of the temples in Tamil Nadu in the same structure are Gangaikonda Cholapuram Praghadeeswarar Temple, Tarasuram Airavatheswarar Temple and Tiruphuvanam Kampahareswarar Temple. Completed in 1010, the temple celebrated its 1000th birthday in 2010. One thousand rupee note, postage stamp  The central government issued a ₹1000 note on 1st April 1954 as a tribute to the Tanjore Great Temple. In it, the dramatic appearance of Prahadeeswarar Temple, known as Tanjore Periya Kovil, is imprinted. Sir Benegal Rama Rao, the 4th Governor of RBI, signed it. Those thousand rupee notes were printed in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Kanpur. The notes were issued in 5 series of numbers. The sequence of notes printed in Mumbai is the English letter A.   In 1995, the central government issued a 2-rupee postage stamp bearing the image of father-in-law Rajaraja Cholan. Millennium Celebration  The 1000th anniversary celebration of Tanjore Great Temple was held in Tanjore for 2 days on 25th September and 26th September 2010. Central Minister b. Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi released a special Rs 5 postage stamp bearing the image of Rasa Periyago. Union Minister GK Vasan received it. A prototype of the special postage stamp was unveiled by Chief Minister Karunanidhi in front. Later Union Minister S.S. Palanimanikkam Periya Kovil and 5 rupees coin engraved with Rajarajan's image was released which was received by Union Minister Narayanasamy. From the morning of the first day of the festival, various street performances by folk artists were held in various parts of the city. In the evening, a grand performance was held at Tanjore Periya Temple in which thousands of dancers participated under the leadership of Padma Subramaniam on behalf of the All India Bharatanatyam Artists Association. The dance program was preceded by a Nataswara music program and after the dance program, a Thirumpi music program by 100 Odhuvars was conducted. On the second day in the morning there was a laboratory in Tanjore Tamil University, a public hall in Tanjore Periya Temple, and in the evening, in the presence of Chief Minister Karunanidhi in front of Tanjore Tilak temple, the events of launching commemorative coin and postage stamp of Tanjore Periya temple and starting basic infrastructure facilities for Tanjore city were held. A historical exhibition was also held[21]. Opinions and facts There is a belief among the people that the shadow of the tower of the Tanjore Great Temple does not fall to the ground. But the plane shadow of this temple is arranged in such a way that it falls on the ground.

"The Tata Group (Hindi: टाता गुपण) is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Mumbai, India. In terms of market capitalization and revenue, the Tata Group is India's largest private corporate conglomerate. The company is also recognized as one of the most prestigious companies in the world.[3][4] The company has holdings in steel, automobiles, information technology, communications, power, tea and medical facilities. The Tata Group has operations in more than 85 countries across six continents, and its companies export their products and services to 80 countries. The Tata Group has 114 companies and subsidiaries [5] across its seven business units, of which 27 are publicly listed. 65.8% of Tata Group's ownership is held through trusts.[6] Major shareholders of the group include Tata Steel, Corus Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Technologies, Tata Tea, Titan Industries, Tata Power, Tata Communications, Tata Teleservices and Taj Hotels. The group is named after its founder Jamsetji Tata, a member of whose family is the permanent chairman of the group. Ratan Tata, the current Chairman of the Tata Group, is J. R. D. He took over from Tata in 1991. It is also one of the major international trading points in the era of globalization.[7] The company is currently in its fifth generation based on family succession.[8] A 2009 survey by the Reputation Institute ranked the Tata Group as the 11th most valuable company in the world.[9] The survey included 600 global companies. History The beginnings of the Tata Group can be traced back to 1868 when Jamshedji Nassarwanji Tata established a trading company in Mumbai for the opium trade.[10] Following this, Empress Mills was started in Nagpur in 1877. In 1903, the Taj Mahal Hotel opened in Bombay for business. After Jamsetji's death in 1904, his eldest son Sir Thorap Tata became the head of the group. Under his leadership, the group invested in iron production (1905) and hydraulic power generation (1910). After Thorab Tata's death in 1934, Navroji Sakladwala headed the group till 1938. He was defeated by JRT Tata. The conglomerate is remarkably extensive with his establishments including Tata Chemicals (1939), Tata Motors and Tata Industries (both 1945), Voltas (1954), Tata Tea (1962), Tata Consultancy Services (1968) and Titan Industries (1984). In 1991, Ratan became the acting chairman of the Tata Group, replacing JRT Tata.[11] Companies Engineering 1 TAL Manufacturing Solutions exports titanium composite floor beams installed on Boeing 787 aircraft.[12] Tata Autocomp Systems Limited (TACO) and its subsidiaries, manufacture auto parts Tata Motors (formerly known as Tata Engineering and Locomotives Company Ltd.

Villagers have been protesting the construction of a perimeter wall on land they historically own for the Tata Steel plant. Many bodies were returned to their families with mutilated wounds. Pending comment, Tata officials said the incident was unexpected. But Tata is said to be pursuing plans to set up a factory there.[18] Dow Chemicals, Bhopal gas leak disaster In November 2006, survivors of the Bhopal gas leak were outraged by Ratan Tata's offer of bankruptcy protection for Union Carbide and development investments by Carbide's new employer, Dow Chemical. The Tata Company has been leading a large-scale effort to eliminate the abundant toxic waste from carbide in Bhopal. American MNC for cleaning Rs. While the Indian government held Dow Chemical's debt for a demand of Rs 100 crore, the group of survivors said Tata's offer was a legal sham to keep the company's debt and intended to facilitate Dow's investments in India.[19] Provision of military rule in Burma Tata Motors has announced deals to supply hardware and automation to Burma's brutal and undemocratic military administration, which has drawn criticism from human rights and republican organizations. In December 2006, Myanmar's Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Dura Shwe Man visited the Tata Motors factory in Pune. [""Myanmar Dice."" December 8, 2008. The Telegraph, Kolkata, India]. In 2009, Tata Motors announced plans to start truck production in Myanmar.[20],[21] Acquisition of land in Singur The Singur controversy[22] in West Bengal led to further questions over Tata's social record, with Tata's Nano factory being relocated due to protests by local villagers and several political parties against forced evictions and inadequate dividends. As the agitation progressed and the support of the ruling CPI(M) government faltered, Tata eventually pulled the project out of West Bengal on security grounds. The Singur controversy was one of the few instances when Ratan Tata was prompted to publicly criticize the military, considering any environmental or social issues. Ratan Tata went on to praise Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for helping to successfully set up the Nano Project there and quickly resolving the situation.[23] Tamra Port On the environmental front, the Tamra Port dispute created a significant stir in India and Tata's global markets. ('India – Tata stumbles over water', Ethical Corporation, November 2007, London, UK)[24] Tamra Port is a joint venture between Tata Steel and Larsen & Toubro. It has drawn criticism from Indian and international organizations, including Greenpeace, as it is located near the Kahirmata Sanctuary and Pidarganika National Park. Kahirmata Beach is one of the world's largest sanctuaries for Olive Ridley sea turtles, and Pidarkanika is a designated Ramsar site and India's second largest mangrove forest. Tata officials have denied that the port is promoting environmental damage, and noted that mitigation measures are being implemented as per the IUCN's recommendations.[25] On the other hand, environmental organizations including Greenpeace have pointed out that no proper environmental impact assessment has been done for the project, which involves a change in scale and specifications as originally proposed, and a port that could interfere with the environment of the Kahirmda beach and the Bitharganika mangrove forest.[26],[27] Protests by Greenpeace also alleged that the construction of the Tamra port had low levels of food infrastructure and was misguided. And the response of DPCL (Tamra Port Company Limited) instead of Greenpeace KVs was sustained in these factors [28],[29]. A soda extraction plant in Tanzania Tata partnered with a Tanzanian company to build a soda ash extraction plant in Tanzania.[30] The Tanzanian government provided all assistance to the project.[30] On the other hand, environmentalists oppose the plant because it is near Lake Natron and is likely to affect the ecosystem of the lake and its nearby residents.[31] Tata plans to relocate the factory and build it 32 km from the lake, but persistent opponents say it will negatively impact the environment.[31] And it could also affect the already-endangered lesser flamingos. Two-thirds of the lesser flamingos breed in Lake Natron.[32] Soda ash is produced by extracting the brine from the lake water, and the used water is then returned to the lake. This processing can interfere with the chemical composition of the lake.[30] Twenty-two African countries opposed the project's development and signed a petition to halt construction.[30] See more Jamsetji Tata Thorabji Tata J.

One of the southern states of India. It borders Tamil Nadu on the east and Karnataka on the north. To the west is the Arabian Sea. Malayalam is the primary language of Kerala. Tamil speakers are also seen more. Thiruvananthapuram is the capital of Kerala. Other notable cities are Kochi, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kottayam. Kerala has the highest literacy (literacy) rate among Indian states. Name reason Scholars claim that the word Kerala is derived from the Tamil word ""seralam"" (hill slope) or Chera country.[9][10] Today's Kerala was historically known as the ""Sera Nadu"". A 3rd century inscription of Emperor Ashoka mentions Kerala - ""Keralaputras"".[11] Also, in the map of the Roman merchant Pericles, he refers to present day Kerala as Cheraputra. The people of Kerala are known as Malayalis.[12] It means those who live in the hills (Western Ghats). specialties On 5 April 1957, it became the first state in Asia to be democratically elected by the Communist Party. Adi Shankara (788-820 AD) was born at Kaladi Origin of Indian classical dance form ""Kathakali"". India's leading rubber producing state The Aromatic Garden of India Kalaripairai is the birthplace of martial arts India's first digital state[13] Among the Indians working in the Gulf countries, there are more people from Kerala state. So the foreign exchange gets extra for Kerala. Geography Western Ghats to the east of the state with an area of ​​38,852 square kilometers; on the west by the Arabian Sea; Tamil Nadu on the southeast; It is bordered by Karnataka in the northeast. Rivers The major rivers of Kerala are Neyyar, Bombai, Manimalai, Periyar, Bharatappuha, Chittaru and Muvattupuha. History  Kerala is a mythological country that emerged when Parasurama's ax split the ocean.   Many Europeans like Portuguese, Dutch, British established their dominance in Kerala. By 1947 Kerala was divided into three princely states namely Travancore, Kochi and Malabar.  According to the Malabar Reorganization Act 1956, Travancore, Cochin and Malabar regions were merged and present day Kerala emerged in November 1956. economy Agriculture is the main industry. Cash crop cultivation is increasing more than food crop cultivation. Traditional industries such as handloom, rope and handicrafts are also doing well. Divisions of Government  Kerala is divided into fourteen districts. They are as follows: Kasaragod Kannur Wayanad Kozhikode hilly Palakkad Thrissur Ernakulam Pliers Alappuzha Kottayam Pathanamthitta Kollam Thiruvananthapuram Kerala has 63 circles, 1634 revenue panchayats, 978 panchayats and five municipalities. Politics   It has twenty Lok Sabha constituencies.[15] For the Kerala Assembly, Kerala is divided into 140 constituencies.[15] Demography According to the 2011 Indian Census, the total population of Kerala state is 33,406,061. The population growth rate has increased to 4.91% in the last decade. Males are 16,027,412 and females are 17,378,649 in the population. Sex Ratio There are 1084 females per 1000 males.

"Multiplication is a fundamental mathematical operation in mathematics. Subtraction, addition and division are the other three basic mathematical operations. If one of the two numbers to be multiplied is an integer, the product of those numbers is the successive addition of the other number times the number of that integer.        a × n =           a + ⋯ + a  ⏟    n     {\displaystyle {{a\times n=} \atop {\ }}{{\underbrace {a+\cdots +a} } \atop n}}   For example, 7 × 4 is equal to 7 + 7 + 7 + 7, or 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 (four sevens or seven fours = 28).     7 × 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28   {\displaystyle 7\times 4=4+4+4+4+4+4+4=28}   In which both 7 and 4 are called factors and 28 is called the product. When two fractions are multiplied together, the quotient and quotient of the answer are the product of the parts of the multiplied fractions and the product of the quotients. For example, a/b × c/d = (ac)/(bd). Similarly, 2/3 × 3/4 = (2×3)/(3×4) = 6/12 = 1/2. A key property of multiplication is interchangeability. Even if the order of the two numbers being multiplied changes, the product does not change.     4 × 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12   {\displaystyle 4\times 3=3+3+3+3=12}       3 × 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12   {\displaystyle 3\times 4=4+4+4=12}   Multiplication of positive integers can be expressed as the number of products arranged in a rectangle or as the area of ​​a rectangle. Because of the interchangeability of multiplication, it does not matter which side of the rectangle is measured first to find the area. The inverse of multiplication is division. For example 3 x 4 =12; Dividing 12 by 3 gives 4 and dividing by 4 gives 3. Multiplying a number by 3 and dividing the answer by 3 again gives the old number as the answer. Multiplication is limited to other types of numbers such as complex numbers and arrays. Code and related terms  Multiplication is denoted by an ""x"", also known as the multiplication sign.[1] It is written between the numbers to be multiplied (eg: 3 x 4). The result of multiplication, i.e. the product, is written with an equal sign. For example:     3 × 2 = 6   {\displaystyle 3\times 2=6}       2 × 2 = 4   {\displaystyle 2\times 2=4}       5 × 2 = 10   {\displaystyle 5\times 2=10}   Multiplication is indicated by placing a period (.) between the two numbers to be multiplied.[2]     5 ⋅ 2   or   5  .  2   {\displaystyle 5\cdot 2\quad {\text{or}}\quad 5\,.\,2}   In algebra, the product of two variables is represented by writing them consecutively without any sign between them. xy for x times y ; 5 times x is also written as 5<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[3996,4001,2,2]}'>x.[3] Multiplication of numbers written in parentheses can also be written in this way. Notationally, 5 x 2 = 5(2) or (5)(2). In multiplication of vectors 'x' and '    ⋅   {\displaystyle \cdot }  ' There is a difference in symbols. In the cross product of two vectors the symbol 'x' and for dot product '    ⋅   {\displaystyle \cdot }  ' symbol is also used. In computer programming, the ""tilt"" is used as a symbol for multiplication. (5*2) Generally, the numbers to be multiplied are called ""factors"". The number to be multiplied is called the ""multiplicand"" and the number being multiplied is called the ""multiplier"" or ""multiplier"". Usually in a multiplication, the multiplier is written first and the exponent second.[4] (though this can vary by language[5]). Sometimes it is also rewritten.[6] And in some places ""multiplicand"" is considered synonymous with ""factor"".[7] In algebra, the product of a variable or coefficient is called a coefficient or exponent. (3<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[6800,6806,2,2]}'>xy2 is 3). The answer obtained by multiplying is called product. The product of integers is a multiple of each of the factors of the product. For example 3, the product of 5 is 15; 15 is a multiple of 3 and 5. Calculation Multiplication of numbers is usually done using multiplication expressions. Multiplication becomes a bit more difficult and error-prone when the decimal digits of the multiplying numbers are greater than two. Common logarithms were invented to simplify such multiplications. Up to three donats can be accurately multiplied using a slip frame. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the invention of calculators has made it easier to accurately multiply to 10 places. With the help of modern computers and calculators, large scale multiplications can be easily done without the possibility of multiplication. Historical methods Multiplication methods are documented in ancient Egyptian, ancient Greek, ancient Indian, and ancient Chinese chronicles. The Ishanko bone, dated 18,000 - 20,000 BC, shows that multiplication was known in Central Africa by the end of the Paleolithic. Egyptians The Egyptian multiplication system, documented in the Rhind Mathematical Papers, used successive additions and multiplications in the multiplication of whole numbers and fractions. For example, to find the product of 13 and 21: 21 should be tripled. ; 4 × 21 = 2 × 42 = 84; . The final product is obtained by adding the appropriate digits of the doubled series: 13 × 21 = (1 + 4 + 8) × 21 = (1 × 21) + (4 × 21) + (8 × 21) = 21 + 84 + 168 = 273. Babylonians Along with the modern decimal system, the Babylonians used sexagesimal notation. So the Babylonian system of multiplication was very similar to today's decimal multiplication. The Babylonians used multiplicative expressions. These expressions contained the first 20 multiples of a particular prime number (principal number n: n, 2<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9163,9168,2,2]}'>n, ..., 20< i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9177,9182,2,2]}'>n) followed by 10<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9203,9208,2,2]} '>n: 30<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9212,9217,2,2]}'>n 40<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9220,9225,2, 2]}'>n, 50<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9229,9234,2,2]}'>n were also present. In hexadecimal multiplication: 53<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9284,9289,2,2]}'>To find the value of n: 50<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9318,9323,2,2]}'>n and 3<i data-parsoid='{""dsr"":[9333,9338,2,2]} Finding the values ​​of '>n from probability and adding them together gives the answer. Chinese   Early Chinese used commas in place value for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, in the pre-300 BC mathematical treatise Zhoubi Suanjing and Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, multiplicative calculations are found in written form in words. Place-valued decimal arithmetic solutions were introduced to Arab countries in the early 9th century by the mathematician Muhammad Ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. Modern methods  The modern multiplication system based on Hindu-Arabic numerals was described by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta laid down the rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. As Princeton University professor Henry Burchard Fine says: Indians were not only the inventors of spatial decimal system but also knew the basic calculation methods in that system. Addition and subtraction were done in those days as they are done today. They used multiple methods for multiplication. One of them is the method of multiplication that we follow now. But they made the division difficult. [8] Construction method Grid or box multiplication is used in primary schools in countries like England and USA. In this way it is easy to understand how digit multiplication is done. 34, in the multiplicative form of 13:  Then the final answer is obtained by adding up the four answers of the grids. Properties  Multiplication of real numbers and complex numbers, including natural numbers, whole numbers, and fractions, has certain properties. Interchangeability The order of the numbers being multiplied is not important. They can be replaced by:  Additive property The order in which the operator is executed can change if only addition and multiplication are involved:  Distributive property Applies to both addition and multiplication. This feature can greatly help in simplifying algebraic problems.  A complete element multiplication equation 1; Any number multiplied by 1 does not change. This is known as samanipuru.  Characteristic of 0 Multiplying any number by a factor is the factor. This property is known as the inverse property or inverse property of multiplication.  the opposite Multiplying any number by −1 gives its additive inverse, i.e. its opposite. where    ( − x ) + x = 0   {\displaystyle (-x)+x=0}   Multiplying –1 by –1 gives answer 1.  Inverse element Any nonzero number x ≠ 0 has a multiplicative inverse. Multiplicative inverse of x: , .

"The Tata Nano is a rear-engined four-passenger city car (four-wheeler) developed by Tata Motors primarily targeting the Indian market. The car has excellent fuel efficiency and excels both on highways and in urban areas.[1] It was first introduced on 10 January 2008 at the Ninth Annual Auto Expo held at the Pragati Maidan in the Indian capital, New Delhi.[2] Commercial sales of the Nano were initially launched on 23 March 2009 and generated over 200,000 car bookings during the booking period from 9 to 25 April.[3][4] Sales of the car will begin in July 2009.[5] The starting price is set at INR 115,000, roughly equivalent to UK Sterling 1,515 or US$2,407. It is cheaper than Maruti 800. Maruti is the next major competitor and the cheapest Indian car at 184,641 rupees ($3,865 U.S.).[6][7][8] Tata aimed to produce the cheapest car in the world[9] – with a starting price of Rs 100,000 (about US$2,000).[10][11] In early 2008, Newsweek magazine identified the Nano as ""the newest of the 21st-century car breeds"" and ""the paradoxically small, lightest, and cheapest (of cars)"" as well as the least expensive personal transportation vehicle—a component on the scale of intrinsic, ""global transportation disruption."" .[12] The Wall Street Journal confirmed the global trend toward smaller cars, including the Nano. ""Nano"" means ""small"" in Gujarati [13]. Gujarati is the language of the founders of the Tata Group. ""Nano"" comes from the prefix SI, meaning one billion. SI is often used to denote ""small"" in English case language.[14] An overview  The Nano's introduction has attracted media attention because of its low price target. The Financial Times wrote: ""If there's one symbol of India's aspiration to become a modern nation, it's surely the Nano, a small car with a small price tag. A triumph for domestic engineering, the $2,200 (€1,490, Sterling 1,186) Nano is the dream of millions of Indians in the uncertain urban realm."" The car is expected to boost the Indian economy, create opportunities for entrepreneurs across India [15][16] and expand the Indian car market to 65% [17]. Described as a friendly ""people's car"", the Nano has been widely praised in the media for its low price [18][19], eco-friendly fuel type[20] and electric car type (E-Nano).[21][22] The Tata Group is expected to mass-produce Nano, especially the electric variety, and not only sell it in India, but also export it worldwide.[23][24][25] Critics of the car questioned its safety in India (90,000 people die in road accidents every year[26]) and the environmental damage it would cause[27] (including criticism from Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rajendra Pachauri [28]). However, Tata Motors has committed to mandating the launch of eco-friendly variants with organic fuel variants.[29][30] The Nano was originally planned to be manufactured at a new factory in Singur, West Bengal, but rising violence forced the Tatas to pull out in October 2008. (See the Singur plant exit section below.) Currently, Tata Motors manufactures the Nano at its existing Bandhnagar (Uttarakhand) plant and the parent plant will be located in Sanand, Gujarat.[31] The company will initially depend on existing merchant networks.[32] The new Nano factory will produce 500,000 cars compared to Singur's 300,000-car facility. The State of Gujarat has agreed to provide all the incentives provided by the Government of West Bengal in kind.[33] design   Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata in 2003[34] started to improve the world's lowest car production, which was inspired by the fact that Indian households owned more two-wheelers than four-wheelers[35]. Development of the Nano was underpinned by the May 2005 success of the low-cost Ace four-wheeler.[34] Against speculation that the car was merely a four-wheeled auto-rickshaw, The Times of India published an article calling the vehicle ""a properly designed and built car"".[36] The chairman was quoted as saying, ""This car doesn't have flexible screens or a roof - it's a real car."" [34] To achieve its design goals, Tata standardized production methods, emphasized innovation, and expected new design approaches from suppliers.[36] The car was designed by Italy's Institute of Development in Automotive Engineering- Ratan Tata with some modifications, including the removal of one of the two windshield wipers, for example.[34] Many of the Nano's components are manufactured by Bosch in Germany, such as fuel injection, brake system, volume motoronic ECU, ABS and other technologies.[37] The Nano has 21% more interior space (despite less headroom in its higher stance) and 8% smaller exterior area than its closest competitor, the Maruti 800. Tata offers the car in three variants: the base Tata Nano; Cx; and Lx. Cx and Lx versions each get climate control, automatic windows and central locking. Tata initially set an annual production target of 250,000 cars. Cost reduction features Nano's door doesn't open at the back. Instead the rear seats can be folded down and moved backwards.[38][39] Unusually there is only one wiper instead of two.[40] There is no power steering.[41] Its door opener is simplified.[42] The wheels have only three accelerators instead of four.[43] There is a mirror to see only one side.[44] The front seats are identical and have integrated headrests. Price  Tata initially targeted the vehicle as the ""lowest-cost production car in the world[9]"" – with a starting price of Rs 100,000 or US $2000 (using the foreign exchange rate of the day) as of 22March2009)[10][11] 6 years ago, commodity prices Even though he was rising then he aimed.[45] As of August 2008, when the car was upgraded[46] and commodity prices rose from 13% to 23%, Tata met its predecessors: Making the car artificially cheaper with government subsidies and tax incentives Deferral of profits By combining with other product manufacturers industries, they reduce their costs and artificially increase the profits of the car Partially inexpensive polymers or biodegradable plastics can be used instead of an all-metal body. Increasing the price of the car[46] Prototype versions  At its launch, the Nano was available in three trim levels.[6] There is no extra charge over the Tata Nano's base price of Rs 123,000. Tata Nano Deluxe CX Rs 151,000,000 with air conditioning. The luxury Tata Nano LX is priced at Rs 172,000 and comes with air conditioning, cloth seats and central locking. Nano Europe, the European version of the Tata Nano has all the above plus a larger capacity, larger three-cylinder engine, anti-lock brake system (ABS) and meets European crash standards as well as pollution control regulations. The base model has limited seats except for the driver's seat, which is adjustable, while Deluxe and Luxury models have air conditioning and body-colored armrests.[47] Technical specification  According to Tata Motors, the Nano car with a 35PS (26kW; 35hp) 624 cc rear engine and rear-wheel drive has a fuel economy of 4.55 l/100 km (22km/l,51.7 mpg (US),62 mpg (UK) city and 3.85 l/100 km). 100 km/h (26 km/l, 61.1 mpg (US), 73.3 mpg (UK) highway. For the first time, a two-cylinder stepless gasoline engine is used in a car with a single-balance crankshaft.[48] Tata Motors claims to have applied for 34 patent registrations for innovations during the design of the Nano. More than half were for the powertrain component.[49] The project's director, Girish Wagh, is credited as one of the main brains behind the Nano's design.[49][50] Much has been made of Tata's pending nano patent applications. However, when he met reporters at the New Delhi Auto Expo, Ratan Tata shot down that these patents are not revolutionary or earth-shattering technology. Much of this, he said, has to do with the car's mechanical components, such as the two-cylinder's single-balance engine and how the gears are reduced when the carriage is driven. However, the car has received praise from many quarters, including riders. Because of this, the Nano is ""not revolutionary in its technology"" because it ""targets an untapped segment of the market and drags on existing technologies,"" yet the same Raiders said that the Nano is only cheap.[51] Also, the expected technologies of the yet-to-be-released car include a revolutionary compressed air fuel system[52] and an eco-friendly electric version[21], which Tata is said to be already working on, but no date has been officially announced for the inclusion of these technologies in the new car. The Tatas claim that the Nano Bharat is subject to Stage-III (similar to Euro-III) environmental quality regulations as well as Euro-IV pollution control norms.[53] Ratan Tata also said, ""This car excels in frontal collisions and side collisions."" [54] The Tata Nano has undergone the required 'assurance' tests by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) in Pune. This means that the car is ready to fly on the road by meeting all the specifications required for the car to run on the road as set by the government, including pollution or noise and vibration. The Tata Nano managed 3.6 km/l in the 'verification' test conducted by ARAI.[55] This makes the Tata Nano a very fuel efficient car. The Nano car is the first car in India to have real fuel mileage information embedded in its mirrors from tests conducted at ARAI. As far as ARAI is concerned the Nano has Euro IV emission standards to be implemented in India during 2010 and has so far been committed to Euro III standards.[56] Rear mounted engine The rear-mounted engine helps maximize interior space, and the raw design is similar to another technological innovation, the Fiat 500 ""people's car"". A follow-on to the prototype Mini proposed in the 1990s by the UK Rover Group with a rear-engined design similar to the Nano, the vehicle never went into production.[57] After the project was taken over by BMW, the new mini car remained technically a conventional large car. The separate now defunct MG Rover Group later based their Rover City Rover car on the Tata Indica. Tata is said to have considered offering a naturally aspirated engine as an alternative.[58]    Assumed differences  Apart from conventional petrol[30] and conventional, the following variants are also expected to emerge. Diesel A website reported that the Tata Nano would be launched in September 2009 with a 690 cc diesel engine.[63] While Tata Motors hasn't confirmed it yet, it hints that a diesel version will be introduced in the near future. ""So far no diesel variant has been offered. Currently it will be offered only in petrol version"".[64] A compressed air engine Tata Motors is working with a French company to use a compressed air engine as fuel.[52] For this reason the company has entered into an agreement with Moteur Development International (MDI).[30] Electric vehicle or electric version Tatas are also developing an electric version, dubbed the E-Nano (with solar panels mounted on the sides),[21][65] which has garnered a lot of fan and media support due to its eco-friendliness, which it claims will make it the ""world's cheapest electric car"".[66] [67] It is also said to be cheaper than the conventional fuel versions. Tata plans to make the Nano compliant with export market restrictions[68] and export a similar car worldwide, particularly to the UK and the rest of continental Europe[23][24],[69] the US and Australia.[25][70][71] ][72] The Economic Times stated[73] that ""the electric Nano"" will be a personal vehicle with even better economic, clean and environmental considerations."" According to Auto Bild, a Hamburg city newspaper, the e-Nano is being built in collaboration with Norwegian electric car specialists Miljøbil Grenland AS.[ 74][75][76][77] Hybrid car LeftlanenNews reported that ""a hybrid fuel version (of the Tata Nano) may also be coming, although it is not yet known whether a petrol or diesel version will be launched alongside the electric motor.[78] Nano Europe Tata Motors unveiled the Nano Europa at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. The car going to Europe and the UK[79] will have several improvements over the regular Nano. The Nano Europe will have an increased wheelbase, a new 3-cylinder engine and interior and exterior enhancements. The Nano Europe is more expensive, heavier, and less fuel efficient than the regular Nano, costing US $6000.[80] expectations According to a report, India has a lot of expectations about nano like other countries especially European countries. An electric version of the Nano[81] in particular is eagerly awaited, making the ""world's cheapest electric car"" possible, as officially documented[66][82]. Ratings agency CRISIL has said that the car itself will boost the Indian economy and expand the Indian car market by 65%.[17] Potential impacts on the Indian economy The Economic Times notes:[17] Tata Nano’s launch could expand the Indian car market by 65%, according to rating agency CRISIL. The low price makes the car affordable for families with incomes of Rs 1 lakh [100,000] per annum, the agency said. The increase in the market is expected to push up car sales by 20% over the previous year. “The unveiling of Tata Nano, the cheapest car in the world, triggers an important event in the car market. Based on the statement by company officials, CRISIL Research estimates the consumer price of the car at around Rs 1.3 lakh. This brings down the cost of ownership of an entry level car in India by 30%,” the company said in a report. A place in history Some news sources compared the Nano to Henry Ford's Model D car a century ago: Livemint said: Ford Motor Co. is rich because Henry Ford used the assembly-line to produce the Model T in 1908. Ratan Tata is a late entrepreneur, making the Nano in 2008.  India is 100 years behind. But we are waking up to the possibility of catching up. I just hope our planners wake up soon.[83] The Times of India also compared the Nano to the Model D:  Although the Nano is not yet in production, it has already been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.[82] Singur factory evacuation After much speculation, Tata Motors announced on 19 May 2006 that it would be manufacturing the Tata Nano in Singur, West Bengal.[84] However, within a week, a few farmers started protests against Tata's acquisition of their land.[85] The case was taken up by Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee.[86] The situation escalated to the point where the Tatas threatened to leave[87], and protestors also blocked the payment of compensation to farmers who volunteered to hand over land.[88] This was later followed by a state-wide shutdown by the Trinamool Congress in October.[89] The state government banned political parties from holding meetings or processions in Singur, and deployed heavy security forces there.[90][91] On 2 December 2006, a clash between police and farmers resulted in widespread violence.[92] On 4 December 2006, Mamata Banerjee went on a hunger strike. After that, a 48-hour strike was announced by him. This was announced in protest over the discovery of the charred body of an agricultural land protection group campaigner named Tabasi in the area of ​​the Nano Singur plant.[93] Two Left Communist Party activists were later sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder.[94] On her 24th day of protest, Banerjee was given artificial respiration. He finally called off his hunger strike after pleas from then President Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.[95] While protests over the land continued into 2007[96], Ratan Tata alleged the involvement of business rivals in the dispute.[97] The land acquisition was initially criticized in February 2007 but was later approved by the Calcutta High Court in 2008.[98][99] Tata Motors delayed the launch of the Nano until September 2008 as political unrest and rain hampered plant installation.[100] Violence continued throughout 2008[101][102][103]. Also in September 2008, Tata Motors announced the suspension of operations at Singur.[104] On 2 October 2008, Tata Motors announced its exit from Singur.[105] On 7 October 2008, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi signed an MoU with Tata Motors to provide land at Sanand in Ahmedabad district of Gujarat to set up a Nano plant.[106] Criticisms, issues and problems Security questions The Times Magazine states:[26]  Tata Motors will offer the Nano with these safety features in the electric version, including an airbag system. The Japan and Korea-made full-metal body comes with Nano safety features such as Crumble Zones, anti-intrusion doors, seat bars, reinforced seats and armrests, body-integrated rear-view mirror. Wheels have no tubes. Mass Automobilization Environmentalists are concerned that its ultra-low-cost mass automobilization will increase pollution and fuel demand in countries like India while the Nano is being developed and designed for a crowd of people who currently use eco-friendly pedals and two-wheelers. Environmentally-focused German newspaper Dei Tageszeitung called such concerns ""irrelevant"" given the Tata Nano's lower output compared to the likes of Volkswagen. It also argues that developing countries should not be denied their vehicular transport rights while industrialized countries must seek to reduce their pollution levels and reduce car use.[107] Dai-Welt claims the car will meet environmental protection norms and cause less pollution in India.[108] In congested cities like Mumbai, Ratan Tata has developed a scheme to offer the Nano only to individuals who do not own any vehicle. The Nano will further fill the gap of overburdened and worn-out two-wheeler polluting two- and three-wheelers. According to Anumita Roysolathri, associate director of the Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi, ""low-cost cars are destructive"" under current policy and regulatory frameworks. [52] Market effects of used cars The Nano will hit the used car market hard as many Indians are waiting for the launch of the Nano and are reluctant to buy used cars of the Nano's closest competitor, the Maruti 800 (a rebranded Suzuki Alto). Sales of used cars and Maruti 800 have declined by 30% and 20% respectively after the Nano's launch. Sums up an auto journalist: ""People are asking themselves—and us—why should they shell out Rs 250,000 for a Maruti Alto when they can wait and get the new Nano for less and a really big one in a few months."" [109] Competitors  Rival automakers such as Bajaj Auto, Fiat, General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai and Toyota have all expressed interest in developing a small car affordable to middle-class consumers in developing markets. The demand for small cars is huge as people are concerned about the often fluctuating fuel prices. Honda and Toyota are leaders in the production of cleaner gasoline-electric hybrid cars, and some environmentalists argue that efforts should focus on reducing the cost of such technologies.[110] Inexpensive and eco-friendly electric cars such as the Tara Tiny, Oreva Super (both said to be cheaper than the Tata Nano) and REVA [111] pose a significant threat to the Nano. Maruti Suzuki is also rumored to be launching a low-cost Alto to counter the Tata Nano.[112] See more  Transport in India Notes  External links    Category: Tata Motors Category:Citation Slippages - Google Translate ",When did the Tata Nano car go on sale in India?,"March 23, 2009",496

"A goitre is a swelling in the neck below the throat due to an enlarged thyroid gland.[1].[2] It is often a result of iodine deficiency. It is known to occur in some people due to dietary habits. An underactive thyroid gland causes goiter. Iodine deficiency accounts for 90% of goiter cases worldwide.[3] They are mostly benign tumors. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome Symptoms of goitre occur due to hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can cause adrenal dysfunction such as: heart palpitations, nervousness, tremors, elevated blood pressure and heat intolerance. Symptoms of anterior gonorrhea are also manifested by hypermetabolism, excessive thyroid fluid secretion, high oxygen consumption, changes in protein metabolism, and abnormal eyeballs (exophthalmos).[4] Symptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain, constipation, lethargy and cold intolerance despite lack of appetite. Glandular inflammation Triiodothyronine and tetraiodothyronine decrease in low iodine levels. As a result, acini cells start swelling from the thyroid gland. Causes of anterior neck injury Globally, iodine deficiency is the leading cause of anterior cervical cancer. The disease has been found to be more common in countries that do not use iodized salt. Selenium deficiency can also cause this disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurs in countries that use iodized salt.[5] Cyanide poisoning also causes anterior neck ulcers. The disease is more common in tropical countries where cassava, which is high in cyanide, is consumed.[6] Hypothyroidism, Iodine deficiency, Goitrogen, Pituitary disease, Graves' disease, Thyroid cancer are some of the diseases associated with anterior neck pain. Cataracts are usually caused due to lack of iodine. However, even when there is no iodine deficiency, some people develop cataracts when goitrogenic substances are ingested in food. Factors that cause anxiety Anti-nutritional factors found in certain plant food classes can cause diarrhea. Eg: Thiocyanate:  Thiocyanite is found in large quantities in mango, cowpea, radish and radish. Perchlorate:  Perchlorate is found in large amounts in carrots and mustard. Thiourea: Thiouracil: Goitrin Peripheral structure Anterior cervical tumors are classified depending on the rate of growth or extent of growth. Growth rate A nodular anterior cervical lesion: multinodular anterior cervical disc;[7][8] Diffused Anterior Cervical Ulcer: Formed due to hypertrophy. Size Type I (palpation goitre): usually not palpable, but can be detected by palpation. Type II: A palpable anterior cervical lesion, easily detectable. Type III: A very large anterior jugular, with compressed space.  Type I anterior neck injury Type III anterior neck injury Type III anterior neck injury  Symptoms of anterior cervical cancer Visible swelling in the lower part of the neck. Tight feeling in throat Cough Change in voice Difficulty swallowing food Difficulty breathing[9] treatment Treatment varies depending on the cause of the anterior neck injury. Radioactive iodine is used to reduce thyroid hormone secretion. Lugol's Iodine or potassium iodide solution is given in low doses if the anterior neck ulcer is due to iodine deficiency. If hypothyroidism causes front neck pain, foods that stimulate them are given. In very intractable patients, the thyroid gland may be completely or partially removed.[10] Quotations  External links  (English)  Category:Endocrinology Category: Malnutrition ",Which vitamin deficiency causes angina?,Iodine,165
"Lal Bahadur Shastri (2 October 1904 – 11 January 1966) was the second Prime Minister of the Republic of India. He was also an important freedom fighter. After the death of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, in May 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri succeeded him. Gulzarilal Nanda was the interim Prime Minister for 14 days until he was duly elected. He died less than 2 years after taking office while attending a summit in Tashkent, Soviet Union. History Lal Bahadur was born in 1904 in a town called Mughalsarai in the present state of Uttar Pradesh. His birth name was Lal Bahadur Sirivastava. His father Sarada Prasad was a school teacher. He then joined the revenue department at Allahabad as a clerk [1]. When he was three months old, he slipped from his mother's hand on the banks of the Ganga and fell into a midwife's basket. Udayar was childless, so he took Lal Bahadur to his house, considering it a gift from God. The parents of Lalbahadur who did not find the child lodged a complaint with the police department. The guards found Lal Bahadur and he was reunited with his parents [2]. Lal Bahadur's father died when he was one and a half years old. So mother Ramdullari Devi took him and his two sisters and went to her father's house to stay [3]. Lal Bahadur grew up in the house of his father Kasari Lal till the age of 10. As there was no high school there, he was sent to Varanasi for further studies. There he stayed at his maternal uncle's house and joined Arisandara High School. While in Varanasi, he once visited a market on the other side of the river Ganges with his friends. He did not have enough money to pay for the boat on his way back, so instead of borrowing from friends he swam across the river [4]. There he found a wonderful teacher named Mishraji who had to swim across the river bank to study without money.[5] As a student, he loves to read books. He was fond of Guru Nanak's lines. He admired Indian freedom fighter Bala Gangadhara Tilak, who dedicated his life to the country after listening to Mahatma Gandhi's speech at Varanasi in 1915 [6]. Opposing the caste system, he removed the family name Sirivastava from his name which was a caste denotation [1]. In 1921, when Gandhi started the Non-Cooperation Movement, he participated in it and went to jail. As he was not old enough to be detained, the government arrested him and sent him out without detention [7]. He then studied for 4 years at Kashi Vidyapeedah, started by nationalist Shiv Prasad Gupta in Varanasi. There Dr. Bhagwandas was greatly impressed by his lectures on philosophy. In 1926 he was given the title of Shastri after completing his studies at Kashi College. It later became associated with his name [3]. He enrolled as a lifetime member of the People's Society's Paniyal and worked for the development of Arsanas at Muzaffarpur[8]. Then he became the head of the organization. He married Lalita Devi in ​​1921. Although he was in the habit of taking huge dowry, he bought only khadi and iraat as dowry. In 1930, he participated in the Salt Satyagraha and was imprisoned for two and a half years [9]. At that time, the woman's health was very bad, so she was released for 15 days on the condition that she would not engage in any protest. But by the time he reached home, his wife had died. [10] He himself returned to the jail with 15 days left to complete the rites. The next year he got permission to go out for a week as his son was sick. But as the son's mood did not improve in a week, he returned to the jail against the request of the family members[10]. In 1937 he joined the Uttar Pradesh Parliamentary Committee as Coordinating Secretary [11]. In 1940, he was sentenced to a year in prison for his individual satyagraha in support of the freedom movement [12]. In 1942, Gandhi started the Quit India Movement. Lal Bahadur Shastri, who had just been released from prison, traveled to Allahabad and issued instructions and orders to the freedom fighters for a week from Jawaharlal Nehru's Ananda Bhavan residence regarding the White Walk Movement. Lal Bahadur Shastri was subsequently arrested and imprisoned till 1946[12]. He spent a total of almost 9 years in prison[13]. He read many books during his imprisonment. He was well acquainted with Western philosophers, revolutionaries and social reformers. Translated the biography of Marie Curie into Hindi[9]. As a minister in Govt After India's independence, Shastri was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary of Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Govind Vallabh Pant was appointed as the Minister of Police and Transport in his cabinet. As the Minister of Transport, he was the first to appoint women as conductors. As the Minister of Police, he ordered the police to use water cannons instead of batons to disperse unruly crowds [14]. In 1951, he was appointed as the General Secretary of the Congress Working Committee. Jawaharlal Nehru was the leader. He was responsible for selection of candidates, election activities, trend of election advertisements etc. His contribution was also responsible for the major victories of the Congress party in the general elections held in 1952, 1957 and 1962. In 1951, he was appointed to the Upper House of India by Nehru. He served as Minister of Railways and Transport from 1951-1956. In 1956, he accepted moral responsibility for the Mehboobnagar train accident that killed 112 people and offered to resign. However, Nehru did not accept his resignation [15]. 3 months later, 144 people died in a train accident in Ariyalur. Shastri then submitted his resignation letter to Nehru. Accepting his resignation, Nehru addressed the parliament about the incident and said that although Shastri was not responsible for the accident, it would serve as a precedent for the constitutional system [3]. OV Alakesan was the joint minister of the department at that time. OV Alakesan was defeated in the next general election by campaigning on this incident.[16] Following the 1957 general elections, Shastri joined Madhuvan's cabinet. He was first Minister of Transport and Telecommunications. Later he served as Minister of Commerce and Industry. He took charge as Home Minister in 1961[3]. When he was the Home Minister, he was responsible for the formation of Anti-Corruption Committee headed by Santhanam [17]. Literary interest Lal Bahadur Shastri translated the history of Marie Curie into Hindi. He died before completing his book on the Indian freedom struggle.[18] As Prime Minister Following the demise of Jawaharlal Nehru on May 27, 1964, there was a vacuum in the government. The then Congress leader Kamaraj Shastri was responsible for becoming the Prime Minister. Nehru's principled and egalitarian style and speech influenced those who did not want Morarji Desai, a conservative right-winger, to become prime minister. His work was successful because of his natural ability to respect alternative opinions and find compromise. He was in power for a short time and could not overcome the country's economic crisis and food shortage. However, his value did not decrease among the Indian people, he tried to bring green revolution in India. India became self-sufficient in food production through the Green Revolution and produced food in surplus, which he did not live to see. He coined the slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan during the 22-day war with Pakistan. While he led the Green Revolution, he encouraged the White Revolution as well. In October 1964, during a tour of Kaira district, he developed a unique idea about dairy farming. He wanted the whole country to have a dairy industry like the successful dairy industry in Anand[17]. Due to this, the National Dairy Development Department was established in 1965. Pakistan war His government got a big problem from Pakistan. Pakistan claimed half of the Kutch peninsula. In August 1965, Pakistan sent intrusion forces into the region. It caused conflict with Indian artillery units in the area. Shastri said in the Lok Sabha about the clashes in Kutch region [19]. We always give priority to economic development projects in utilizing our limited resources. So anyone who looks closely at this will understand that India has no interest in border disputes and India does not want an amicable environment... In this context the duty of the government is clear. It will be fully implemented by the government.......we will not hesitate to live in poverty in times of need but we will not let it destroy our freedom for any reason... According to the plan proposed by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Pakistan was given 10% of Kutch instead of the 50% it had demanded. However, Pakistan's intention of aggression was concentrated in the Kashmir region as well. Militants from Pakistan have infiltrated Jammu and Kashmir. Shastri subsequently warned Pakistan that force would be met with force.[20] In September 1965, a large number of Pakistani soldiers and militants entered Indian territory. They expected the overthrow of the government and a rebellion in their favour. But nothing happened. India sent its troops into the LoC and threatened Pakistan by crossing the border near Lahore. As the war broke out, there was a massive artillery battle in the Punjab region. Both the armies achieved many victories. Indian forces brought Lahore within their bombing range. India received a letter from China on September 17, 1965 while the Indo-Pakistani war was going on. It said that the Indian Army had installed equipment in Chinese territory and India would incur China's wrath if it was not withdrawn. Seeing this threat from China, Shastri said that this accusation of China is false and if China attacks India, we will fight with determination to protect India's freedom [21]. China has not taken any action. The Indo-Pakistani war caused heavy human and economic losses to both countries. The Indo-Pakistani War ended on 23 September 1965 with a cease-fire decree brought by the United Nations. death Shastri and Pakistani President Mohammad Ayub Khan attended a summit in Tashkent convened by Soviet leader Alexei Kosychin to resolve the lingering issue of implementing the cease-fire. Lal Bahadur Shastri left for Tashkent on 2 January 1966 with the full consent of the Indian Cabinet. There, the leaders of the two countries and their delegations talked for seven days but could not come to a conclusion. That night, Kochisin intervened and negotiated an agreement with the two leaders in private. The next day, on January 10, 1966, Shastri and Khan signed the Tashkent Declaration. If you think about why it took so many days to sign this declaration, which is full of very simple clauses (nine aspects), you can understand the huge mental gap between the two countries. That night, Shastri, who had returned to his room after attending a party given by the Russian Prime Minister, started coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath at one o'clock in the morning and died. He was declared dead at 1.32 am after suffering a heart attack. He has already had two heart attacks. He is the only Indian Prime Minister to die abroad while in office. Many also believe that there may be a conspiracy in his death.[22] Regarding the Indian Prime Minister who died in Russia, ""the world is a little smaller without Shastri,"" said US President Johnson. During preparations to bring Shastri's body in a coffin to India, Kosijin and Ayub Khan carried the coffin onto the plane. Shastri, who has held many positions, does not have a house of his own. Lately, he bought a car in installments and left the loan to his heirs. Graveyard Lal Bahadur Shastri's body was also buried near the burial place of Gandhiji. The words ""Jai Jawan Jai Kishan"" meaning ""Long live the warrior! Long live the farmer"" are inscribed on the tombstone.

"Sabarimala (Sabarimala), Malayalam: (Sabarimala) is a holy place in Pathanamdittha district in the Western Range of Kerala. Sabarimala is given as the place where Swami Ayyappan meditated after killing a monster named Mahishi. The Sabarimala Ayyappan Temple is situated between eighteen hills. This temple is on top of a hill. And when compared to the mean sea level, it is found at a height of 914 meters. It is also surrounded by mountains and forests. Temples are found on every hill surrounding Sabarimala. At places like Nilakkal, Kalaketi, and Karimalai we can still find practical and intact temples. Remains of ancient temples can be found on other hills. [1] Sangam History It is a place of worship of the Sangam Cheras.  Cult tradition About 45 to 50 million pilgrims make the pilgrimage to Sabarimala every year.[2] Sabarimala is one of the most visited holy places in the world every year. Every devotee undertaking the pilgrimage to Sabarimala, regardless of caste, creed, caste, caste, caste or social status, with one mind, one desire and consuming the same mantra, i.e. the best of the pilgrims, is to reach the feet of Lord Swami Ayyappan. For example, However, women between the ages of 10 and 50 do not undertake this journey socially. Also no permission is given to enter the temple. Generally, women do not visit this temple because of Swami Ayyappan's history of banning the entry of women belonging to household exclusion and many other reasons. The main reason for this is the belief that Swami Ayyappan was a celibate. For offering temple prayers only on days declared as Mandal Pusai (roughly November 15 to December 26), Makara Lannu (January 14- ""Makara Sankaranti"") and Vishu (April 14), and the first five days of each Malayalam month. kept open. ‎  Pilgrimage Before undertaking the pilgrimage, devotees must first undergo a 48-day virutam (hard penance). For this, devotees should wear a special garland made of urutraksha or tulsi beads around their neck on the initiation day. From then on the fasted servants should generally abstain from meat, fish, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, contact with women, lewd speech and words, and unedited hair and facial moustache, and observe such rules with propriety. . Every day they have to visit the local temples and pray there. Also wear traditional clothes in plain black, blue or saffron colors. Although today's rules for fasts are not strictly followed as they were in earlier days, people generally adhere to a set of rules. The restrictions on travelers are attributed to the following: In earlier times there was only the ""Great Road"". You have to go through the forest, there are many animals, and since white is a color that can be seen from a long distance, they used black and blue fabrics with less light scattering to escape from wild animals. In earlier times, it would take many days to reach the Pampa river through the forest, so they used to carry the offerings to the Lord on one side and the food items on the other side. These rituals will help prepare travelers for the events that may occur during this holy pilgrimage, such as bathing in cold water, celibacy, and not shaving. Even today, hundreds of devotees prefer to leave Erumeli and walk barefoot through the forested mountain trails (about 45 kms) with the same belief as Swami Ayyappan did in those days. The first part of this journey will start from Erumeli and take you to Arutha river. Then cross Arutha hill to reach Kariyam Thodin. Now we have to climb and cross the holy Karimala. From there it passes Cheriyanavattam and Valiyanavattam and finally joins the Pampa river. Those who take up the 'Thiruparana Kosha Trip' should stay at Aranmula Kottaram. But many pilgrims who undertake the pilgrimage travel in vehicles and take alternate routes to reach the holy banks of Pampa river. After that, all the pilgrims have to climb the (Neelimalai) jungle path with a distance of about four kilometers to reach Sabarimala. Once a heavily forested area, this single lane road has now been upgraded and is lined with shops and medical facilities on both sides. Sabarimala has also started online booking facility since 2011 to facilitate the darshan of devotees from long distances. The Kerala Police Department has made arrangements for this.[3] Travancore Devaswam Board Travancore   The Devaswam Board (TDB) has insured the Sabarimala Swami Ayyappan temple for around Rs 30 crore ($7 million). It is also introducing and implementing a scheme to provide free accident insurance to travelers visiting this place. About one lakh rupees can be provided through this insurance scheme for those injured and killed in an accident on the 18-km route from Neelakkal to Sannithanam on the trekking route. The Sabarimala tour brings good revenue to the Kerala government and contributes about Rs 10,000 crore to the economy of Kerala. Temple offerings Aaravani and appam are offered as prasadam in the Sabarimala temple. These are made from ingredients like rice, ghee, sugar etc. The rice for this offering at Sabarimala is sourced from Chettikulangarai Devi Temple. The temple is the second largest among the temples under the Travancore Devaswam Board. This temple is located at Mavelikkara Harivarasana A song called Harivarasanam is played before entering the temple at night. Harivarasanam, a lullaby played before the Lord goes to sleep at Sabarimala today, was composed and composed by Sri Kampakudi Kulathur Srinivasa Iyer. At the Srinivasa Ayyar temple, standing in the presence of Swami Ayyappa, he sang this song after the puja. Through the efforts of Swami Vimosanananda, Tantri and Melasanti of the temple adopted this song as a hymn. This song has 352 letters, 108 words and 32 lines (8 stanzas). Although there are versions of this song sung by many famous singers, K. J. The song sung by Yesudas is being broadcast. At that time, not only the devotees, but also those who are engaged in government work and those who are engaged in business stand up. The song is composed with traditional raga rhythm. The respect given when a national anthem is played is also given when the song is broadcast. Neyabishekam The main ritual performed at the Sabarimala temple is Neyyapishekam on the idol of Swami Ayyappan with the sacred ghee found in the pallikattu or irumudi (hand-stitched cotton cloth bag with two compartments for holding items for creation) that devotees carry on their heads. It is considered as a philosophy that represents the sacred union of Jivatma and Paramatma. Devotees undertaking the journey for the first time (known as Kanni Ayyappanmars) should wear a saffron-coloured irumudi. Other pilgrims wear black or blue turbans. Agam brahmasmi and tatvamasi Devotees who make a pilgrimage to this temple are blessed with unparalleled knowledge, which in Sanskrit, tat dvam asi, means ""you are also a god"". Thus, everyone who goes on pilgrimage calls each other Swami. And this term refers to the desire for all to attain the state of Paramatma or Universal Soul. Kandararu Maheswararu is the chief priest (Tandri) of the Sabarimala temple who belongs to the Thalamon family.

With a population of around 10 million (one crore), this city is one of the 35 largest cities in the world. Ever since the British set foot in Chennai in the 17th century, Chennai has grown into a major city. Chennai is considered as the gateway to South India. Marina Beach in Chennai is one of the longest beaches in the world. Chennai is the home of the Tamil film industry known as Kollywood.

It also ranks second in the country in the IT sector. Chennai was ranked 26th in the New York Times magazine's list of 52 places to visit in the world in 2014[11]. History The city of Chennai has a long history. Chennai is believed to have been an important seat of the Pallava, Chola and Vijayanagara empires from the 1st century onwards. Traders and religious preachers from foreign countries came through Chennai coast. This area was originally a small village called Chennapatnam.  It was on the 22nd of August 1639 that this city, which is one of the symbols of the Tamils, came into being. On that day, Franciste and Andrew Cogan of the East India Company along with their assistant Perithimappa bought the site that is now Fort St. George. The town to the north of the fort was called Chennapatnam in honor of Chennappa Nayakkan, the father of Ayyappan and Vengadappan, who sold the place to them. Although the city of Chennai developed only after the British built Fort St. George in 1639[12], the adjoining towns such as Tiruvallikeni, Mylapore, Tiruvottiyur and Thiruvanmiyur are centuries older than that. Mylapore in Chennai was the main port of the Pallava government. One of Jesus' companions, St. Thomas, died in AD. There are those who believe that he preached here from 52 to 70. The Portuguese who came here in the 16th century established a port in 1522 named Xanthom (San Toma - ""Saint Thomas""). Then in 1612, this place was handed over to the Dutch. In 1639, it was chosen as a settlement for the British by Francis Day and Andrew Cogan, agents of the English East India Company. Fort St. George was built a year later. The settlement of the British developed around the fort. The villages of Tiruvallikeni, Purasaivakkam, Egmore and Sethupattu which were adjacent to Chennapatnam were joined to this. In 1522, the Portuguese came here and built St. Thomas Fort. Subsequently, the area came under the control of the Bodhisattvas. Their settlement was established in 1612 in an area called Pulikadu north of present day Chennai. In 1688, Chennai was declared the first city council by King James II. With this, Chennai became the first city in India. Robert Clive of the East India Company used it as a base for his military operations. Later it was named ""Chennai Province"", one of the 4 provinces of the British Indian Settlement. In 1746, the French forces captured Fort St. George and the city of Chennai. In 1749, these came back under British control. After that, the city of Chennai developed a lot. Major cities in India were connected to Chennai by rail. Madras became the capital of Madras Province after the independence of India in 1947. Chennai Province was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1969. The name of the city Madras was also changed to Chennai in 1996. A few years after India's independence, in 1956, when the states were divided linguistically, Chennai became a part of Tamil Nadu and the capital of the state. The Tamil Nadu government changed the name Madras to Chennai in 1966 as it was believed to have been given by the Portuguese. As the British bought Chennai George Fort land from the Venkatapati brothers, the Venkatapati brothers demanded that the city should be called Chennapatnam after their father 'Chenappa Nayak'.

"The Second World War or World War 2 was a war fought during the period 1939-45. Most of the countries of the world, including all the great powers, were involved in one way or another. They were divided into two major factions namely the Axis Powers and the Allied Powers. The event was held on a scale never seen before in the history of the world. About 10 crore war veterans took part in it. According to the theory of total war, the countries involved in the war used their entire economic, productive, industrial, military and scientific resources to destroy their adversaries. Thus the distinction between military and civilian resources disappeared. It was the deadliest war in history, with massive ethnic cleansing and mass casualties such as the atomic bombings.[1] It is generally accepted by historians that the war began with Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. On the one hand, the countries that Britain included in its empire were France and the Allies. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy on the other hand formed the Axis. In 1939–41, the Axis powers conquered all of Western Europe. Britain alone escaped their clutches. Then the Axis forces tried to conquer North Africa. In June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the Allies as the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union. The Japanese Empire, which had been waging war on China since the early 1930s and occupying large parts of it, also joined the Axis. Sappan entered World War II by attacking the United States in December 1941. The United States, which until then had only provided logistics to the Allies, also became directly involved in the war. The Spanish forces soon conquered much of Southeast Asia and advanced to the eastern tip of India. The war situation which was in favor of the Axis countries till 1942 was reversed that year. The Axis advance on the eastern edge of Europe was halted by Soviet forces. Axis forces were defeated and retreated in North Africa as well. In the Pacific Ocean, American forces began to recapture one area after another lost to the Allied forces. Allied forces invaded Italy in 1943; Soon the country surrendered. In 1944, Allied forces invaded Western Europe by sea. Attacked by Soviet forces in the east and British, American and French forces in the west, Germany was defeated within two years. World War II ended in Europe with the surrender of Germany in May 1945. During the period 1943-45, the United States had conquered the archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean and advanced towards the Japanese home islands. In August 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This resulted in the surrender of Sappan and the end of World War II. As a result of this, great changes took place in world politics. European colonial empires lost their power; Decolonization began in Africa and Asia. The United States and the Soviet Union became the world's new superpowers; A cold war started between them. The United Nations was created to work for world peace. Time frame  The German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 is considered the start of World War II. Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. Many date July 7, 1937, the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, as the start of the war.[2] English historian A.J.P. According to A.J.P. Taylor, the Sino-Japanese War in East Asia and the Second European War involving Europe and its colonies were fought separately. The two wars combined in 1941 to form World War II and lasted until 1945. No consensus was reached on the end date of World War II. World War II was considered to have ended on August 14, 1945, when Japan fell, but Japan officially surrendered on September 2, 1945. Some European history books refer to May 8, 1945 as the date of Germany's defeat. However, the Allied peace treaty with Japan was signed only in 1951.[3] Likewise, a final settlement agreement with Cherumani was not reached until 1990.[4] Background of the war The fall of the Central Powers Austria-Hungary, Germany and the Ottoman Empire in World War I drastically changed the political and diplomatic situations of Asian, European and African countries. In 1917, the Bolshevik wing of the Russian Socialist Party seized power in Russia. Meanwhile, the Allied victory of Britain, France, America, Italy, Serbia, and Romania and the new states created by the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire caused major changes in the map of Eastern Europe. After the war there was unrest in Europe. According to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had to accept a lot of economic, territorial and colonial losses. Germany lost thirteen percent of its territory and all its colonies. Also various military restrictions were imposed on Germany. Meanwhile, the Russian Civil War resulted in the formation of the Soviet Union. Joseph Stalin, who came to power in the Soviet Union after Lenin's death in 1924, began implementing the Five Year Plans instead of New Economic Policies. The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918–19, and a democratic state emerged. In the inter-war period, Germany saw civil strife between nationalists and communists. A similar situation developed in Italy. Although Italy achieved some territorial gains from the Allies, Italian nationalists resented the Treaty of London. From 1922 to 1925, the Italian Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power with the determination to create a new Roman Empire. In Germany, the Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler took power and in 1933, Hitler became Chancellor. The Kuomintang Party in China launched a military campaign for Chinese unification in the 1920s against the feudal lords. But it soon became embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist alliance. Japan, which had long wanted to invade China, invaded Manchuria in 1931, citing the Manchurian Incident, and established a puppet government called Manchukuo. China, powerless to oppose Japan, sought help from the League of Nations. The League of Nations condemned Japan for its occupation of Manchuria. So Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. The two countries then engaged in several minor skirmishes in Shanghai, Rehe, and Hebei until the Tanggu Armistice was signed in 1933. Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist the Japanese occupation of Manchuria thereafter. Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 after a failed attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923. He abolished democracy and introduced Nazism. He also started military reforms and arms purchases in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Meanwhile France, with the intention of forming an alliance with Italy, allowed Italy to occupy Ethiopia as a colony. In 1935, the situation worsened when Germany legally annexed the basin. The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front, which Germany wanted to control. Alarmed by Germany's ambitions to conquer large swaths of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union signed a mutual aid agreement with France. But before this agreement came into effect, it had to go to the approval of the League of Nations, so it was not very useful. However, in June 1935, the United Kingdom signed an Independent Naval Treaty with Germany, easing some restrictions. Concerned about events in Europe and Asia, the United States passed the Neutrality Act in August. In October, Italy invaded Ethiopia. Germany's support for the invasion resulted in Italy withdrawing its objections to Germany's intention to invade Austria. Hitler violated the Treaty of Versailles and Locarno and concentrated his army in the Rhineland. This did not attract much opposition from the other European powers. When the Spanish Civil War began in July, Hitler and Mussolini supported the ""Fascist Nationalist Forces"" and the Soviet Union supported the Spanish Republic. Both sides used this fight to test their new weapons and battle tactics. In 1939, the Nationalist forces won the war. In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Axis powers. A month later, Germany and Japan signed an international anti-communist movement agreement. A year later Italy joined the treaty. After the Xi'an Incident in China, the Kuomintang and Communist forces declared a ceasefire in order to form a united front against Japan. Pre-war events Italy's occupation of Ethiopia  The Second Italo-Abyssinian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. This war was fought between the armed forces of the Italian Empire and the armed forces of the Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinia). At the end of the war, Italy won and established its colony in Ethiopia. Thus Ethiopia was incorporated into East African Italy. The war revealed that the world system was not a strong peacekeeping force. Although Italy and Ethiopia were members of the Organization of Nations, the organization did not take any action against Italy. Spanish Civil War  The Spanish Civil War was a major civil war fought in Spain from 1 April 1939 to 17 July 1939. Germany and Italy supported the nationalist forces led by Francisco Franco in rebellion. The Soviet Union gave its support to the left-wing Spanish Republic that was already in power there. Germany and the Soviet Union used the fighting to test their new weapons and war tactics. The German Condor Legion bombing of Gernica contributed to widespread concerns that the next major war might involve terrorist bombings of civilians. Chinese occupation of Japan  In July 1937, Japan captured Beijing, the former capital of China, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. This incident prompted Japan to launch an all-out invasion of China. The Soviets, acting quickly this time, made a deal to provide logistical assistance to China. This ended the Sino-German collaboration (1911–1941). Chinese military commander Tsung Kai-shek used his best German-trained regiment to defend the city, but Shanghai fell to the Japanese three months later. Japanese forces pushed past the Chinese forces and captured the capital, Nanjing, in December 1937. Tens of thousands of civilians and surrendered Chinese soldiers were killed in the Nanjing Massacre that followed. Tens of thousands of Chinese women were raped by Japanese soldiers. In June 1938, Chinese forces flooded the Yellow River to block the advance of Japanese forces. This gave the Chinese forces some time to mount defensive efforts in the city of Wuhan. However, Wuhan fell to Japanese forces in October. These victories failed to overcome Chinese resistance as the Japanese had hoped. The Chinese government shifted its headquarters to the interior of the country and continued the war from there. The Soviet Union and the Mongol occupation of Japan  On July 29, 1938, the Battle of Gasan Lake erupted as Japanese forces entered the Soviet Union. Although the Soviets won the battle, Japan did not accept the end of the war as a defeat. After this Kalkin launched the Battle of the Gol River on 11 May 1939 to expand the Japanese-Mongolian border. Although the Japanese offensive initially met with some success, the Japanese forces suffered major defeats against the Soviet forces. The results of these conflicts led a section of the Japanese government to consider making peace with the Soviet Union to avoid Soviet intervention in the China War. Instead they wanted the Japanese government to focus on American and European territories in the Pacific Ocean. European occupations and treaties In Europe, Germany and Italy began to take more visible steps. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria. However, there were no major objections from other European countries. Driven by this, Hitler began to claim the Sudetenland, the German-majority region of Czechoslovakia, as part of Germany. Britain and France soon ceded the area to Germany against the wishes of the Czechoslovakian government. In return, Germany also promised that no other territory would be claimed. Even after this, Germany and Italy made Czechoslovakia cede its territory to Hungary and Poland. In March 1939, Germany occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia. The latter split the country in two to form the Slovak Republic and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Britain and France, awoken by Hitler's claim to the Danzig region, pledged their support for Poland's independence. Similar assurances were given to Romania and Greece following Italy's annexation of Albania. Following the Anglo-French commitment to Poland, Germany and Italy signed an iron pact of friendship and alliance. In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which stipulated mutual neutrality during wars with their other countries. Both countries have defined political and territorial rights between them. Germany gained influence over western Poland (the Second Polish Republic) and Lithuania, and the Soviet Union over eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Bessarabia. Thus the liberation of Poland was called into question. The course of the war War broke out in Europe (1939–40) On September 1, 1939, Germany and the Slovak Republic invaded Poland. On September 3, 1939, France, Britain and the Commonwealth declared war on Germany. However, Poland received no help other than a small-scale invasion by France. France and Britain began a naval blockade of Germany to disrupt the German economy and limit the war effort. On September 17, 1939, the Soviet Union, which had signed an armistice with Japan, invaded Poland. Although Poland was thus fragmented between Germany, the Soviet Union, Lithuania and Slovakia, the Poles refused to surrender and continued to fight alongside the Allies, establishing a shadow government and revolutionary army. In Western Europe (1940–41) In April 1940, Cerumani occupied Denmark and Norway in Operation Veseriupung to secure shipping supplies for iron ore from Sweden and to counter Allied action to prevent the extraction of natural Norwegian waters.[5] Denmark readily obeyed. It was won by the Norwegian army after two months of fighting with the help of the Allies.[6] Mediterranean (1940–41) Italy began operations in the Mediterranean and initially blockaded Malta in June. Italy then invaded British-held Egypt in September 1940, conquering British Somaliland in August. Italy went to war with Greece in October 1940, at the behest of Mussolini, who was jealous of Hitler's success. However, the attack was forced back within days and the Italian forces had to retreat to Albania.[7] Axis invasion of Soviet Russia (1941)  While the situation in Europe and Asia was relatively stable, Cherumani, Sappan and Soviet Eurasia made preparations. As tensions with the Soviet Union increased, and as Sappan planned to take advantage of the war in Europe to seize Europe's rich resource holdings in Southeast Asia, the Soviet–Span Treaty of Neutrality was signed in April 1941 between the Soviets and Sappan.[8] At this time Cheruni was secretly preparing to attack the Soviet Union and was massing forces along the Soviet border.[9] War Breaks Out in the Pacific (1941) In 1931, it started the war in the Pacific by conquering the Manchurian region of China and creating a puppet government called ""Manchukuo"". Due to this a battle took place at Burutal. Axis powers Italy, Germany, and Japan signed the Tripartite Pact on 27 September 1940. Japan dreamed of exploiting the natural resources of the Pacific Ocean. On December 7, 1941, Chapan's fighter planes attacked Pearl Harbor on the American island of Awai, destroying American warships and aircraft. By plundering the island, Sappan thought his long-held dream had come true. The US also ransacked the ""Iba"" air base before it could free itself. Only now did America decide to go to war against Germany. In December 1941, the United States captured Ivan in the Western Pacific and Wake Island in the North Pacific. By mid-1942, the United States had captured the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, and Burma. Thailand remained neutral. In 1942, Indo-British forces opposed the Sappan forces in Indian territory and Australian-New Zealand forces in New Guinea. America claimed victory in the Battle of Solomon Islands. As Japan captured the Philippine capital of Manila with 43,000 troops, American commander MacArthur fled to Australia with his family. In 1944, MacArthur arrived with a large force and conquered the Philippines. At 7 am on August 6, 1945, an American B-29 dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. 78,000 people died as a result. Even after that, 12,000 people died from radiation. Three days later, the US dropped a US-UK nuclear bomb on the Japanese port city of Nagasaki. 38,000 people died as a result. Sappan surrendered on 15 August 1945. Axis progress stalled (1942–43)  By July 1941, Germany had invaded all neighboring countries in a blitzkrieg. German warplanes would rain bombs and soldiers would parachute in and open fire on civilians without even giving them time to realize what was happening. Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France were all European countries that were occupied by Germany in two years after the end of the war. Germany was on the losing end until America, which had been neutral for a long time, declared war. Germany's arrogance, 'Hitler' did not even communicate the news of his invasion of Japan and Italy, the other countries he had signed treaties with, and did not pay half as much attention to his soldiers as he did to torture the Jews and his enemies. When Germany invaded Russia, the Cold War had begun. Hitler was reluctant to give his soldiers even essential items like wool. Those who were commander-in-chiefs are not in a position to listen to anyone. The German soldiers could not protect their minds and bodies in the cold. The BBC estimated that 25 million people were killed in the Russo-German War of 1942-1943. After the war that began on July 5, 1943, Russia recovered the Soviet city of Smolensk on September 25, Kiva on November 6, and Leningrad on January 27, 1944. Later, Germany was attacked by Operation Bagration. On 22 July Mitches town was liberated. On July 24, the Polish city of Magdanac was also captured by Russian forces. Hence the progress of the Axis powers was also hampered, and their dream shattered. Allied advance (1943–44) During the Guadalcanal Campaign in May 1943, the Allied forces launched several operations against the Japanese. The first of these was in May 1943 when Allied forces were sent to the Aleutian Islands to remove Japanese forces. Following this, the forces rushed to capture many archipelagos such as Rabaul Islands, Marshall Islands, Gilbert Islands near Australia in the West. By the end of March 1944, Allied objectives were complete and the Caroline Islands were also captured. In April of the same year, the New Guinea campaign to the west began. During the summer and spring of 1943 the Germans prepared for major offensives in central Russia. Kursk (Battle of Kursk) German forces attacked on July 4, 1943. But because the situation was not right, Hitler's operation of the troops was canceled. Mussolini was arrested and exiled that month (July 9). In November 1943 Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin met in Cairo, Republic of China. Allied Victory (1944)  On December 16, 1944, Germany made its last major effort at the port city of Antwerp, Belgium, in a battle on the Western Front.[10] This victory allowed the Allied forces to advance without much effort.[10] The Western forces encircled and attacked the Allied forces of Germany and succeeded. This event led to a stagnation in the course of the war for the Italian forces. In the middle of 1945, the Soviet army and the German army clashed on the Oder river. Poland was also attacked in the fighting and East Prussia was captured by the Allies.[11] On February 5, 1945, the leaders of the United States, England, and the Soviet Union met and consulted in the Yalta Conference in the Black Sea region. At this conference the Soviet Union prepared to launch a war against Japan to eliminate German aggression.[12] In February 1945, German support forces on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea invaded Silesia and Pomerania when Europe's sixth river, the Rhine, was closed. In March of that year, Allied forces were encircled and besieged in the German city of Remagen in the north and in the south. The Soviet Union then advanced to Vienna.[13] In early April, Soviet and Polish forces launched a diagonal attack on parts of Italy and West Germany's Berlin. On April 25 of the same year, Soviet and American forces met at the Elbe River in Germany. In April 1945, the Reichstag, Germany's parliament building and the country's heritage building, was captured.[14] During this period there was a change of many important officials. The death of US President Theodore Roosevelt on April 12, Harry S. Truman took office. Mussolini was assassinated by the Italian Resistance on 28 April 1945.[15] Two days later, German dictator Hitler (Death of Adolf Hitler) committed suicide.[16] German forces agreed to surrender on April 29 (kamerad). Germany surrendered unconditionally on 7 May, and the treaty entered into force on 8 May.[17] After that, until May 11, the German Army Group Center was protested in the Czech city of Paraguay.[18]  In April 1945, a joint effort by US-Philippine forces led to the evacuation of other forces from the island of Leyte in the Pacific Ocean. In March 1945, troops were concentrated in Luzon to capture Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Fighting continued in places like Luzon and Mindanao until the capture of Manila.[19] On the night of March 9, a US Air Force Boeing B-29 Superfortress dropped a fire-breathing atomic bomb on the city of Japan, killing 100,000 people in no time. Between 350,000 and 500,000 civilians died in fires in 66 cities in Japan over the next five months as a result of the joint US-British offensive.[20] In May 1945, the Australian forces were eager to capture the oil fields in the island of Borneo, which was under the rule of countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. In March, the United States, Britain, and China defeated Japanese forces in northern Burma. British forces then reached Rangnai, the capital of Myanmar, on 3 May.[21] On April 6 and 7, 1945, Chinese forces launched a counterattack in the Battle of Western Hunan. American forces were advancing, capturing Imojima in March and Okinawa in late June.[22] While American forces were destroying Japan, Allied submarines were preventing Japan from getting aid from any other country.[23]  On July 11, 1945, the Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany. The Potsdam Agreement[24] was promised to surrender unconditionally. Meanwhile the United Kingdom had a general election in which Clement Attlee won. Considered the leader of World War II, Winston Churchill was a companion.[25] Seeing Japan's violation of the agreement made on July 27, 1945, the United States and England, together with the United States, rained atomic bombs on cities like Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in early August. They agreed to surrender on August 15, 1945, and surrendered on September 2, 1945, on board the Allied ship Missouri. Russia took control of the Schengen Islands.[26][27][28] On August 15, 1945, Japan agreed to surrender, but finally surrendered on September 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri.[26][27][28][29] Fall of the Axis Powers – Victory of the Allies (1944–45) See also these World War I Anzac Day 11.11.11.

"Continent () refers to the largest continuous land mass. The Earth is divided into seven continents. These are identified by convention rather than by any particular reason. From largest to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. 1] In geology, continents are described by plate tectonic structures. Plate tectonics is the study of the movement, collision, and separation of continents, formerly known as continental drift. Definitions and Functions  Conventionally, ""continents are large, contiguous, discrete landmasses separated by large bodies of water.""[2] Not all of the seven continents commonly known by convention are discrete landmasses separated by bodies of water. The term ""large"" is an arbitrary classification: Greenland is considered the world's largest island by surface area; But the geographical area of ​​Australia is considered a continent. Similarly, the criterion of continuity is often ignored and continental shelves and oceanic islands are included; North and South American continents are also located contrary to this theory. Eurasia and Africa are considered two continents even though they are not separated by any natural body of water. This contrast becomes even more apparent when the contiguous landmasses of Europe and Asia are divided into two continents. The Earth's landmasses are surrounded by a single continuous global ocean, which is divided into many oceans by continents and other geographic scales.[3][4] Continents are sometimes expanded from primary landmasses to include all the landmasses of the world as part of a single continent.[5] The surfaces of the continents Continent can be narrowly defined as a continuous[6] land mass or landmass; Coasts and land boundaries formed the boundaries of the continent. According to this theory the European continent (sometimes ""the continent"") refers to the European mainland; In this, the islands like Great Britain, Ireland, Iceland etc. were removed. Similarly, the term Australian continent refers only to the Australian mainland, excluding islands like Tasmania and New Guinea. Following this theory, the rhetoric of the United States defines the continental United States as including only the 48 contiguous states in the center of North America (separated by Canada) and Alaska in the northwest, excluding the Pacific island of Hawaii. In a geological or geographical approach, a continent is a continuous landmass and includes nearby shallowly submerged areas (continental shelves)[7] and offshore islands (continental islands), which form part of the continental structure.[8] According to this, the coastal plain is the real boundary, as the coastlines are changed by the fluctuations of the ocean.[9] According to this approach the British Isles and Ireland are part of Europe; Australia and New Guinea together form one continent. According to the cultural elements, the continental boundary spans the continents and includes islands and continental fragments. Accordingly, Iceland is considered a part of Europe and Madagascar is considered a part of Africa. Extending this theory further, some geologists have combined the islands of the Pacific Ocean with the Australasian tectonics and referred to them as Oceania. It divides the Earth's surface into continents and continental landmasses.[10] Separation of continents  Exceptions to the basic principle that each continent should be a separate landmass have arisen, usually through arbitrary, historical conventions. Of the seven continents, only Australia and Antarctica stand apart from the rest. Many continents are not completely defined as separate regions; divided into ""almost distinct territories"".[11] Asia and Africa are connected by the Isthmus of Suez; North and South America are connected by the Isthmus of Panama. Both of these isthmuses are much narrower than the mainlands they connect. Their transversal artificial waterways (the Suez and Panama Canals respectively) separate these landmasses. Dividing Eurasia into Asia and Europe, which is not divided by any sea, is an aberration. If Eurasia is accepted as one continent then the world can be divided into six continents. This approach is accepted in geology and geology. The division of Eurasia into Europe and Asia is seen as a remnant of Eurocentrism: ""In geographical, cultural and historical diversity, the People's Republic of China and India correspond to the complete European continent; not to any single European country. A better alternative (even if incomplete) is to France, not to complete India, such as Uttar Pradesh."" A proper comparison is with an Indian state.”[12] However, for historical and cultural reasons, Europe is considered a separate continent in many classifications. In the theory of seven continents, North America and South America are considered separate continents. However, they can also be viewed as one continent, America. This view prevailed in the United States until World War II; It is also observed in some Asian six-continent theories.[13] Also in Spain, Portugal and Latin American countries, these are considered a single continent. This application can be found under names such as Organization of American States. Some have used the term ""Americas"" since the 19th century. If the continents are defined as separate landmasses and all contiguous landmasses are united, the single landmass comprising Asia, Europe and Africa is called Afro-Eurasia. According to it there are four continents: Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia. During the Ice Age, when sea levels were low, many continental shelves emerged as dry land and land bridges; At that time Australia (the continent) was the only continuous land mass. Likewise the Americas and Africa-Eurasia were connected by the Bering Bridge. Other islands, such as Great Britain, were also attached to their mainland mainlands. At that time there were only three continents: Africa-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, Australia-New Guinea. Number of continents Continents are divided in several ways:  The seven continents are taught in the People's Republic of China, India, parts of Western Europe and most English-speaking countries. The six-continent format, with the Americas as one continent, is taught in Spanish-speaking countries[24] and in some European countries (some with the exception of uninhabited Antarctica, all five) such as Greece.[18] The International Olympic Committee has adopted a five-continent format that excludes uninhabited Antarctica.[16][17] Olympic symbols#The Olympic symbol includes five rings.[25] The term Oceania or Australasia is sometimes used to refer to Australia and the adjacent Pacific and Pacific islands. This usage can be found in the textbooks of Canada [20] Italy, Greece (country) [18] and Latin American countries, Portugal, Spain. Area and population  The following table summarizes the area and population of each continent.[26]  Including all the continents, the total area is 148,647,000 sq km. It is approximately 29.1 percent of the world's land area.

"A cat is an omnivore belonging to the mammal family. These are domesticated by humans. Domesticated cats also eat a vegetarian diet. Since cats were worshiped animals in ancient Egypt, they were commonly kept and worshiped at home. When cats died, the Egyptians built pyramids for them and buried some rats. Kings and their cats were assigned places in the pyramids. Anatomy  Cats typically weigh between 2.5 and 7 kilograms (5.5–16 pounds). Small cats weigh less than 1.8 kg (4.0 pounds). Some cat breeds, such as the Maine Coon, occasionally grow to over 11 kilograms. There have also been cats weighing 21 kilograms as a world record. Similarly, the smallest old cat in the world weighed almost 1 kg [2] [3]. The average male feral cat in the Boston area weighs 4 kilograms. The weight of an average female feral cat is 3 kilograms [4]. Cats have an average height of 23 to 25 cm (9-10 in) and a head/body length of 46 cm (18 in). Male cats are generally larger than female cats. A cat's tail is on average 30 cm (12 in) long[5]. Cats have 30 vertebrae (humans have 33). Cats with fine hearing have 32 muscle fibers in their ears. Cats' loudest vibration is 64 kHz. They sleep 12-16 hours a day. Normal body temperature ranges from 38 - 39 °C (101 - 102.2 °F). Cats have a rapid reproductive rate. A cat's forelegs are connected by floating ribs. So cats can fit their bodies into any small space their heads can fit. Cats have five claws on their front feet and four claws on their hind feet. Cats have a cushion-like foot structure so that they do not transmit sound when they walk. The consuming sense is 14 times that of a human. Cats cannot taste sweet because their tongues do not have sweet taste buds. Cats have lost this ability due to genetics. Cats recognize other tastes. Cats carry their young for up to two months. A cat can have up to 150 kittens in its lifetime.  The cat's skull differs from that of typical mammals. Large eye sockets and strong and specialized jaws distinguish the cat from other animals[6]:35. The 35 teeth in the jaw are adapted for feeding and shredding flesh. The pair of long fangs inflicts a fatal pressure bite on the neck of the prey, causing severe damage to the vertebrae and trunk, severing and piercing it. This results in paralysis and death from irreversible paralysis [7]. This system enables it to easily capture its favorite rodents.[7] Both premolars and first molars form a pair on either side of the mouth and perform the scissor-like function of cutting meat into pieces. Cats are efficient feeders. This type of tooth structure and nutrition is essential because cats 'cannot chew food with their small molars, and cats are often not capable of chewing their food[6]:37. Health The average lifespan of cats has risen in recent years. In the early 1980s, it was seven years, rising to 9.4 years in 1995 and 12-15 years in 2014. However, there is evidence of cats surviving up to 30 years of age. World's Oldest Cat, Cream Puff, Dies at 38 Diseases A wide variety of health problems can affect cats, including infectious diseases, parasites, injuries, and chronic illness. Vaccines are available for many diseases, and domestic cats are routinely given treatments to remove parasites such as worms and fleas. In addition to the obvious dangers of rodenticides, pesticides, and herbicides, cats can be poisoned by many chemicals that are considered safe by their human guardians. feelings  Cats have excellent night vision. Low-level light is concentrated behind the eye's retina by a lens called the davidum lucidum, resulting in blurred vision even in low or dim light [8]. They are capable of seeing in one-sixth of the light that humans need to see. Cats have excellent hearing and can hear a wide range of sounds. They can hear higher pitched sounds more clearly than humans and dogs[9][10]. Cat breeding Archaeologists say cats have been domesticated by humans for 10,000 years. Africans were the first to domesticate cats. Cats were originally bred to eat mice. Then they are attracted by the way they interact with humans and start breeding. Nature Cats are carnivores by nature. They are selective in hunting small mammals. They are capable of chasing prey at short distances only. Cats are loners. So dogs, unlike lions, are separate from humans, like tigers and leopards. Cats do not expect special attention like dogs. Cats are very playful. Their playfulness makes them hunters. Acquaintance Cats are very human friendly. Shows his love by wagging and rubbing his tail. Cats have the ability to understand if they are called by name, petted, or laughed at. They often come and lie down near their foster parents. Categories There are two types of cats. They are wild cat and domestic cat. A wild cat is a carnivore. A domesticated domestic cat can also eat a vegetarian diet. Generally all male cats are called tom and all female cats are called queen. Kittens are known by names like kitten, kitty, and pussycat. Cleaning  Cats are very self-cleaning. Cats clean their fur thoroughly by licking it. Cats have the ability to ball up the fur that sticks to their tongues in their mouths while cleaning.  A self-cleaning cat A self-cleaning cat Biting cat  Food Cats are carnivores. Cats in the home should be provided with the right amount of food. If cats eat the food that dogs eat, their eyesight will deteriorate. Cats of the Famous The Prophet kept cats. Pope Benedict XVI raised the cat as his brother. The American poet Erlite Hermingway bred genetically defective cats, so it became customary to call hermingway cats for genetically defective cats. Former US President Pilkinton had a cat named Sax. It also had access to the President's private room and press room.

Following this, a rally was held at Rayapuram Robinson Park on Sunday, September 18 at 4 pm. Mr. Annadurai was elected as the first general secretary of the party. A black and red flag was chosen as DMK's flag. History DMK won the first general election in 1952. Did not participate. ""The DMK drafted the Constitution of India without knowing the views of the Dravidians and harming the livelihood rights of the Dravidians and under the autocratic system of one party. As a sign of condemnation, the DMK in the election. The party announced that it has not fielded its candidates. However, the party announced that it would support candidates who accept the demand for an ""autonomous Dravidian nation comprising the Dravidian ethno-linguistic states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala"". On July 14 and 15, 1953, DMK organized a three-pronged protest against the Kulakalvid program brought by the then Chief Minister Rajaji, a protest to change the name of ""Dalmiapuram"" to ""Kallakkudi"", and a black flag protest against Nehru's call of Tamil Nadu people as ""nonsense"". Conducted DMK held in Trichy on May 17, 18, 19, 20, 1956. The party decided to participate in the elections in the 2nd state convention.

Sampath left and formed the Tamil National Party. This was the first split in the DMK. In 1961 DMK held a rally for the Tamils ​​living in Sri Lanka. In the 1962 general elections too, DMK campaigned with the demand of ""Dravidian Nadu"" liberation. The DMK contested alongside Rajaji's Swatantra Party and the Muslim League. Won in 50 seats. However, party general secretary Annadurai lost in the Kanchipuram Legislative Assembly constituency. In 1963, the Government of India promulgated the ""Prevention of Secession Bill"" to prevent ""secessionists"" from contesting elections. Subsequently, DMK held on June 8, 9, 10, 1963. In the General Assembly, the main policy of the party was changed in the liberation demand of “Dravidian Nation”. The 'Goal' section of the party has been changed to ""The four linguistic states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka will strive to become a close Dravidian confederation by gaining as much additional powers as possible within the framework of Indian statehood, unity and constitutional law.""

"Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (November 7, 1888 – November 21, 1970) was an eminent Indian scientist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. He discovered the change in wavelength that occurs in scattered light rays when light passes through a material. The change in the wavelength of the scattered light is called the Raman effect. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery. This invention is very useful and world famous for detecting many different properties of objects (without harming the object) today. CV Iraman was born on November 7, 1888 in Tiruvanaikaval, a town near Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu, India. 1930 was the first time that a scholar educated entirely in India won the Nobel Prize. Life Chandrasekhara Venkataraman's father, Ir. Chandrasekhar Iyer is a teacher. Venkataraman completed his schooling there as his father worked as a physics lecturer in Visakhapatnam. He completed his BA degree with distinction in 1904 from the State College, Chennai. Venkatraman pursued his post-graduation in the same college. In January 1907, he passed the M A degree examination in first class with excellent marks in all subjects. In February 1907, he took the finance department exam and got first place in it. In June 1907, he started his career as Chief Accounts Officer in Calcutta. C. V. After graduating, Raman joined the Indian Government Finance Department as an accountant in 1907 as there were no scientific job opportunities. However, concurrently with his work at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in Calcutta, founded by Dr. Mahendra Lal Sarkar, he conducted methodological studies on light scattering. Later, in 1917, he joined the newly established Palit Faculty of Physics at Calcutta University. After spending 15 years in Kolkata, he spent 15 years at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. After that, he worked as the director of the Raman Research Institute, which he founded himself, until his last days. He left this world on November 21, 1970. His contributions to science C. V. Raman founded the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926 and worked as its editor. He started the Indian Science Academy and later served as its president from the very beginning. He also took the lead in publishing its scientific journals. Not only that, he started the Current Science Association in Bangalore, served as its president, and established a scientific paper called Current Science, which became famous through that association. Scientific research and discoveries He published the results of his findings in the Indian J. Physics on February 28, 1928 under the title A new Radiation along with Kariyamanikam Srinivasa Krishna. This scientific light effect paved the way for him to win the Nobel Prize and to have a scientific effect named after him. It is noteworthy that he published in an Indian journal. He also researched musical instruments like violin (fiddle) and Mritangam and made new discoveries. He has also explained why the sky is blue during the day. It is noteworthy that Subramanian Chandrasekhar, the son of his sibling, also won the Nobel Prize. specialties He was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Society of London in 1924. In 1929, the British government honored him with the title of ""Knighthood"".

"Malaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy in Southeast Asia. Consisting of 13 states and three tropical zones, Malaysia is divided by the South China Sea into two regions: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia shares land and sea borders with Thailand to the north, Singapore to the south, Vietnam to the northeast, and Indonesia to the west. East Malaysia shares land and sea borders with Brunei, Indonesia, and the Philippines and Vietnam. The capital and largest city of Malaysia is Kuala Lumpur. Putrajaya is the administrative capital of the Central Government. With a population of over 30 million, Malaysia is the 44th most populous country in the world. Tanjung Piai, the southern tip of the Eurasian continent, is located in Malaysia. Located in the tropics, Malaysia is one of the 17 most biodiverse countries and has a large number of breeding species. The total area of ​​Malaysia is 329,847 square kilometers (127,350 sq mi). Peninsular Malaysia alone has a population of 20 million. Currently the population of Malaysia is 2.5 crore. Majority of them are Malays. Next to them, Chinese and Indians also live. The majority of Malaysians follow Islam. Islam is also the national religion of Malaysia. Malay is the national language. It gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957. Now the reigning King of Malaysia is Muhammad V. It ranked second in the list of countries with the fastest economic growth in the twentieth century. After the 14th general election held on 9 May 2018, Mahathir bin Mohammed was sworn in as the 7th Prime Minister of Malaysia on 10 May 2018.[12] History Prehistoric times Prehistoric evidence is abundant in Malaysia. Stone weapons dating back 2 lakh years have been found in Bukit Java. Neah Caves, located in Sarawak, East Malaysia, are home to human remains dating back 40,000 years. The ancestors of the aboriginal Semang people are thought to have been Africans from about 40,000 years ago. Perak Man, the earliest known skeleton from Peninsular Malaysia, is 11,000 years old. It was discovered at Lenggong. Early period BC Merchants and settlers from India and China established trading ports and cities in the early first century. Later, Malaysia was under the rule of the Sri Vijaya Empire. There are historical evidences that the Chola King Rajendra Chola won a battle in a place called Kadaram in the 11th century. Over the next 20 years, the Cholas made a series of invasions of Sumatra and the Malayan Peninsula. The arrival and wars of the Cholas weakened Srivijaya rule. Sultans Various sultans ruled from the beginning of the fifteenth century. Parameswaran, a prince of the Sri Vijaya Empire, established the Malacca Sultanate, considered the first independent kingdom of the Malayan Peninsula. Parameswaran converted to Islam. During this period, Islam spread rapidly. Malacca also became an important trading center during this period. European settlement regimes Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511. Then in 1641 it was captured by the Dutch (English). In 1786, the Sultan of Kedah leased Penang to the British East India Company. Thus the British Empire established itself in Malaya. The British conquered Singapore in 1819. And in 1824 they brought Malacca under their control as per the Anglo-Dutch treaty. In 1826, the British brought Penang, Malacca, Singapore and Labuan Islands directly under their control, making them their final colonies. Sappan ruled from 1943–1945 during World War II. During this period ethnic issues arose and nationalism prevailed. Britain came back to power after the war. And Britain consolidated the administration of Malaya into a single final settlement called the Federation of Malaya. However, the Malays opposed this. Also under the leadership of the Malayan Commonwealth (Communist) Party, the united fighters waged a guerilla war against the British forces. Contemporary Malaysia gained independence on 31 August 1957 and in 1963 became the modern Malaysian state known as the Federation of Malaysia. In 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became an independent country. After the ethnic riots of 1969, a controversial new economic policy was introduced aimed at giving the indigenous people known as Bhumiputra an equal share in economic development. It is noteworthy that in the recent past, minority Indians have been protesting that they are being neglected. In November 2007 and February 2008, large crowds tried to gather and protest, but were dispersed by police with tear gas. Regimes   Malaysia is a confederation of 13 states and three federal territories. These are divided into two regions. Peninsular Malaysia has 11 states and two federal territories and East Malaysia has two states and one federal territory. The governance of the states is devolved between the central and state governments and the federal territories are administered by the central government.[13] All 13 states are centered around historically formal Malay kingdoms. 9 of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia are ruled by their hereditary rulers and are known as Malay states. Their monarch is elected by them from a council of nine rulers for a five-year term.[14] Each state has a single house called the state legislature. The states in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) have their own immigration policies and restrictions.[15] Accordingly, the rest of Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia) is considered foreign under immigration laws.[16] Each state is divided into districts and districts are further divided into villages. In Sabah and Sarawak, the districts are grouped into divisions.[17] The Malaysian Parliament has the power to resolve issues arising in the areas of land, Islamic religion and local government to provide equal justice to all states. It also has the power to intervene in the administration of a state at its request. Except for some land-related laws, the states themselves look after the issues occurring within the states. Under the country's law, non-Islamic issues are managed at the national level in compliance with the Malaysia Agreement.[18] Geography  Malaysia is the 67th largest country with a total land area of ​​3,29,847 square kilometers. It also shares land borders with Thailand in West Malaysia and Indonesia and Brunei in East Malaysia.[19] It is connected to Singapore by a narrow land bridge. It shares a maritime border with Vietnam [20] and the Philippines.[21] Land boundaries are often defined by geographic features such as the Berilisu River, the Golok River, and the Bagalayan Canal. But maritime boundaries are still debated today.[19] Brunei is completely surrounded by Malaysia[22] which bisects the state of Sarawak. Malaysia is the only country in the Asian mainland and the Malay Archipelago to have a sovereign territory.[23] Tanjung Piai, at the southern end of Johor state, is the southern tip of the Asian continent.[24] The Strait of Malacca plays a major role in global trade, passing 40 percent of the world's cargo between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia.[25] Economics Malaysia is generally characterized as an efficient and state-run economy and a newly industrialized market economy.[26][27] The government, which plays a major role in economic activities through large-scale economic programs, is gradually reducing its role. One of the countries with the best economic data in Asia, Malaysia's GDP grew by approximately 6.5% per year from 1957 to 2005.[14] GDP in 2010 was $414.4 trillion in US dollars; It is the 3rd largest value among ASEAN countries. Malaysia's GDP is 29th in the world.[28] Demography According to the 2010 census, the population of Malaysia was 28,334,135[3]. It is known as the 43rd most populous country in the world. Many ethnic groups live in this country. Ethnic Malays make up 50.4%, while other non-Malay Bumiputras make up 11% [19] . According to Malaysian law, all Malays are Muslims. They follow Malay culture. The Malays are influential in Malaysian politics. The status of Bhumiputra is given to non-Malay Thai, Khmer, Sam people and the tribal people of Sabah and Sarawak. More than half of Sarawak's population is non-Malay Bumiputras. In the state of Sabah, two thirds are non-Malay Bumiputras[19]. Tolkudi people live in small numbers in Peninsular Malaysia. Laws defining who is a bumiputra vary from state to state. Chinese descent accounts for 23.7 percent of Malaysia's population, and Indian descent accounts for 7.1 percent [19] . They do not have the right to be Bhumiputras. The Chinese influence Malaysian business. In the early 19th century, large numbers of Indians were brought to Malaysia by the British to work on plantations [29]. Most Indians are Tamils ​​[30] . One cannot acquire Malaysian citizenship just by being born in Malaysia. A child born to two Malaysians abroad is granted Malaysian citizenship. Malaysia does not grant dual citizenship [31]. There is little difference in citizenship for those in East Malaysia and West Malaysia. It was established to facilitate drinking entry. time  Although Islam is the official religion of Malaysia [32], the law allows the free practice of other religions. Approximately 61.3% follow Islam, 19.8% follow Buddhism, 9.2% follow Christianity, 6.3% follow Hinduism, 1.3% follow Taoism, Confucianism, and other Chinese religions [33] 0.7% are non-religious and 1.4% follow other religions [33]. . By law all Malays are Muslims [32]. According to the 2010 census, 83.6% of ethnic Chinese follow Buddhism, 3.4% follow Taoism, 11.1% follow Christianity, and a small number follow Islam. 86.2% of Indians follow Hinduism, 6.0% follow Christianity and 4.1% follow Islam. 46.5% of non-Malay Bumiputeras follow Christianity and 40.4% follow Islam [33]. It is the courts that decide matters related to the religion of Muslims. It will specifically inquire into divorce, marriage, inheritance rights, religious conversion and apostasy. Criminal cases and legal civil cases are not covered. The problems of non-Muslims do not fall within the jurisdiction of proper courts. Courts of law do not hear Islamic cases and refer them to the proper courts [34]. Language The official language of Malaysia is Malay. It is a standardized form of the Malay language. English was used as the language of administration. After the riots of 1969, the Malay language was prioritized [35] . English continues to be a second language. English is also the language of instruction in mathematics and science in public schools [36][37]. Derived from British English, Malaysian English is mostly used in business. Manganese is also used extensively in commerce. Manglisu is a debased form of English mixed with Malay, Chinese, and Tamil [38][39]. There are 137 languages ​​spoken in Malaysia [40] of which 41 are spoken in Peninsular Malaysia.[41] Aboriginal people in East Malaysia speak their own language other than Malay. It can easily be recognized that it is not Malay. The people of Sarawak state speak the Iban language and the people of Sabah speak the Dusunic language [42]. The Chinese in Malaysia speak several regional languages ​​of southern China. Cantonese, Mandarin, Okean, Cassian are some of them. Tamils ​​speak Tamil. Tamils ​​are the majority of Indians here. Culture   Malaysia has people of different ethnicities, with different cultural elements and speaking different languages. The initial culture of the region was formed by the indigenous people who lived here and the Malays who migrated here. Chinese and Tamil cultural influences occurred during the historical period when foreign trade began. It absorbed Persian, Arab and British cultural influences. The culture of ethnic minorities is not spontaneous due to constitution, social harmony etc.[43] In 1971 the Malaysian government announced the ""National Cultural Policy""; It defined Malaysian culture as being based on tribal culture and absorbing relevant elements from other cultures, with Islam playing a major role.[44] And Malay is said to be more widely spoken than any other language.[45] Non-Malay minorities opposed such government intervention as diminishing their cultural heritage. Chinese and Indian associations petitioned the government to express their opposition.[44] There have been cultural clashes between Malaysia and neighboring countries (especially Indonesia). Both countries share a common heritage and rich customs. However, many disputes have arisen, ranging from food items to Malaysia's national anthem.[46] Both governments have tried several times to reduce these conflicts.[47] The Malaysian tiger is the national animal of Malaysia. game Sports widely played in Malaysia include soccer, volleyball, handball, bowls, tennis, squash, martial arts, equestrian, sailing, and skateboarding.[48] Volleyball matches attract tens of thousands of spectators; Malaysia is one of only three countries to have retained the Thomas Cup since 1948.[49] The Malaysian Turf Bowls Association was incorporated in 1997.[50] The first squash competition was held in 1939, introduced by British naval officers. The Squash Bat Association was formed on June 25, 1972.[51] Malaysia has proposed a football confederation for Southeast Asia.[52] As of August 2010, Malaysia's men's volleyball team was ranked 15th in the world.[53] The third and tenth editions of the Cricket World Cup were held at the Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur.[54] Malaysia has a Formula 1 track – the Sepang International Circuit. The 310.408 kilometers (192.88mi) circuit hosted the first Grand Prix in 1999.[55]  Formed in 1953, the Malayan Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1954. Malaysia participated in the 1956 Summer Olympic Games. In 1964, the team was renamed the Malaysian Olympic Team. It has participated in all but one Olympic Games since its inception. It has sent the highest number of participants (57) to the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972.[56] Malaysian competitors have won four gold medals at the Olympics so far; Notably, all of these were in volleyball.[57] Malaya has participated in the Commonwealth Games since 1950 and Malaysia since 1966. In 1998 the Games were held in Kuala Lumpur.[58] There are two types of martial arts practiced in Malaysia, Silat and Tomoi. media Malaysia's primary newspapers are state-owned or owned by parties in the ruling coalition.[59] However, some major opposition parties also own newspapers.[60] There is a divide between the media outlets from the two parts of the country. Peninsular media give less priority to eastern news; The area is considered a settlement area of ​​Peninsular Malaysia.[61] The media is blamed for the growing problems between Malaysia and Indonesia. They are also responsible for the low opinion of Indonesians.[62] Malay, Chinese and Tamil newspapers are published in Malaysia.[61] Because media freedom is very limited, government accountability is limited.[63] The government has tried to suppress opposition newspapers before elections.[60] In 2007, all private television and radio stations were ordered not to broadcast speeches by opposition leaders;[64] this was condemned by the opposition Democratic Action Party.[65] All the dailies except one in Sabah are privately owned. This region is home to the most independent media in Malaysia.[61] The Press and Publications Act has been criticized as a hindrance to freedom of expression.[66] infrastructure  Malaysia's infrastructure is one of the most developed in Asia.[67] With 4.7 million landline lines and 30 million landline lines, its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore in Southeast Asia.[68][69] Malaysia has seven international trading ports; Klang Port is an important port. 200 industrial parks and specialized structures such as Technology Park, Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park are encouraging industrial development.[48] 95% of the population is provided with clean drinking water. During the Civilization period, development structures were developed in economically influential cities and places leading to security. Even though development plans have focused on rural development since independence, they still lag behind the west coast regions of Peninsular Malaysia.[70] While telecommunications services are good in urban areas, access is limited in rural areas.[68] Roads are widely laid in Malaysia; Among these are distance expressways.[19] The North-South Expressway, the country's longest highway, stretches 800 kilometers (497 mi) from the Thai border to Singapore. Roads in East Malaysia are not well constructed and are of poor quality unlike those in Peninsular Malaysia.[71] Malaysia has 118 airports, including 38 well-served airports. Along with the country's state-owned Malaysia Airlines, two other airlines provide domestic and international air travel services. Railway services have been nationalized; serving a distance of 1,849 kilometers (1,149mi).[19] Some cities, such as Kuala Lumpur, have established relatively low-cost elevated light rail transit systems.[72] Asean Rail Express is a train service connecting Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. The service is planned to connect Singapore and China in the future.[67] Traditionally, Malaysia's energy production has relied on shale oil and natural gas.[73] The country's power generation capacity is 13 GW.[74] It is estimated that there are still 33 years of natural gas reserves and 19 years of oil reserves. The government is also trying to use renewable energy resources.[73] 16 percent of electricity is generated by hydroelectric power plants and the other 84 percent by thermal power plants.[74] The state-owned company Petronas owns the majority of oil and gas production.[75] The Energy Commission of Malaysia regulates energy activities in the Peninsular and Sabah under the Electricity Commission Act, 2001.[76] Quotations  External links    Category:Southeast Asian countries Category:Former British Colonies Category:Member States of the United Nations ",What is the language spoken in Malaysia?,Malaysia,0

Her birth name was Indira Priyadarshini Nehru, after her marriage to Feroze Gandhi she became Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, Indira Gandhi for short. He was sworn in as Prime Minister on 19 January 1966, succeeding India's second Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who served for a few days as caretaker Gulzarilal Nanda, and served until 24 March 1977. He lost the general elections in 1977 and won again three years later. He resumed office as Prime Minister on 14 January 1980 and remained in office until his assassination in 1984. He was a great political planner and thinker. He had an unusual appetite for political power. In the patriarchal Indian society, she led the country from the highest position with a strong sense of authority contrary to what is expected of a woman. As a prime minister, he used all the resources available to him to consolidate his power and authority. They accuse him of using his power to form weak cabinets. He sidelined the strong senior leaders of the Indian National Congress. As part of this, the ruling Indian National Congress split in 1969 following disagreements over the appointment of the President. The faction under his leadership, known as the Indira Congress, continued to rule with great strength. His party returned to power in the 1971 elections. At that time, in the conflict between West and East Pakistan, he started a war with Pakistan in support of East Pakistan's demand for independence and sent troops into East Pakistan. As a result of this successful operation, East Pakistan separated from Pakistan and became a separate country called Bangladesh. Indira Gandhi, who declared Emergency in 1975, was accused of using Article 352 of the Constitution to increase her powers and try to suppress the opposition. The 19-month-long crisis greatly affected Indira Gandhi's influence. However, misjudging his influence, he conducted the election and suffered a major defeat. He lost in his own constituency. His second son, Sanjay Gandhi, who was said to be groomed as his successor, also failed. However, the multi-party alliance that replaced his party failed to complete its full term due to infighting and collapsed in three years. As the incompetence of the opposition was exposed, the people re-elected Indira in the next election. Indira learned from her past mistakes. His second reign was marked by moderate bureaucracy. However, his reign was not smooth. Sanjay Gandhi, who was expected to succeed him during this time, died in the crash of his piloted plane. Sikh extremism was on the rise. Indian leaders feared that the growing influence of religious and extremist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindaranwale would pose a challenge to Indian unity. Indira sent an army to suppress the terrorists. He allowed the army to enter the Golden Temple, the holiest temple of the Sikhs, to capture the terrorists and their leader who were believed to be hiding with weapons. The subsequent military operations angered Indira among the Sikhs. Subsequently, on October 31, 1984, he was shot dead by two of his own bodyguards, both Sikhs. youth   Indira Priyadarshini was born on 19th November 1917 as the only child of Jawaharlal Nehru and Kamala Nehru from Kasumi Pandit family. Indira's grandfather Motilal Nehru was a wealthy lawyer in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. Motilal Nehru was one of the most prominent members of the Indian National Congress in the pre-Gandhi period. Indira's father Jawaharlal Nehru was well educated and a barrister in England. He was also a famous leader of the Indian freedom struggle. Around the time of Indira's birth, Nehru entered the Indian freedom struggle under the leadership of Gandhi. Growing up under the full care of her mother Kamala Nehru, who was patient and absent from the Nehru household, Indira developed a strong protective instinct and a private nature. His grandfather and father were constantly involved in national politics, which also mixed with his meticulous problems. He had conflicts with his father's sisters, including Vijayalakshmi Pandit. This continued in the world of politics. In Nehru's autobiography, Towards Liberation, he writes that during his imprisonment the guards often came to his house and took away some chairs for fines imposed on him by the government. ""These continuous subversive processes took a toll on my four-year-old daughter, Indira. She resisted the police and expressed her strong opposition. I feared that those early feelings might change her future outlook on the police force in general."" mentioned that. Indira established an organization called Vanarasena for young women and men. This Anar Sena organization played a significant minor role in the Indian freedom struggle by organizing protests and flag marches, and by distributing sensational publications and banned articles of Congress politicians. Education in Europe In 1936, Indira's mother Kamala Nehru finally succumbed to tuberculosis after a long struggle. At that time Indira was 18 years old. Indira never enjoyed a stable family life in her youth. While studying at Somerville College, Oxford University, England, in the late 1930s, he became a member of a radical pro-independence Indian group based in London.[1] In the early 1940s, Indira spent time on a house retreat in Switzerland to recover from an incurable lung disease. He maintained a distant relationship with his father through long letters, similar to the correspondence he had with his father since his childhood. They also discussed politics through letters. [2] During his years in Europe and England, he met a young Parsi man named Peroz Gandhi who was active in politics.[3] Marriage with Peroz Gandhi When Indira and Peroz Gandhi returned to India, they were lovers. Between doctors' advice, they decided to get married.[4] Indira liked Peroz's openness, sense of humor and confidence. Nehru did not want his daughter to marry so soon. And sought Mahatma Gandhi's help to break up their love affair. Indira was very stubborn in love. A Hindu marriage took place in March 1942.[5] Both Feroz and Indira were members of the Indian National Congress. In 1942, when they took part in the White Quit Protests, both were arrested.[6] After independence, Peroz contested elections and was elected as Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh. After the birth of two sons, Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi, the couple separated until 1958 due to some differences. When Perros suffers a heart attack, their broken marriage is put back together. But Perros died in September 1960. Political involvement President of Indian National Congress  During 1959 and 1960, Indira Gandhi was elected as the President of the Indian National Congress. His tenure was not remarkable. He had to act as his father's representative. Indira did not contest any seat in the 1960 elections. Minister of Information and Broadcasting After Nehru's death on 27 May 1964, at the insistence of the new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, he contested the Indian elections and joined the Indian cabinet by being immediately appointed Minister of Information and Broadcasting.[7] Indira rushed to Madras because of the protests in the non-Hindi-speaking state of Tamil Nadu due to the introduction of Hindi as the national language. Talking to government officials there, he moderated the anger of community leaders and reviewed the reconstruction efforts of the affected areas. Lal Bahadur Shastri and other senior ministers were astonished by such an attitude which they failed to show. Minister Indira Gandhi's actions were not aimed at Shastri or her own political advancements. He was reportedly disinterested in his day-to-day ministry activities, but had a knack for media savvy and political and partisan building.  ""During the series of struggles between Mrs. Indira Gandhi and her rivals, the Central Congress [Party] leaderships in several states and the upper caste leaders in the state Congress [Party] organizations replaced them with backward castes, thereby defeating the rivals in the State Congress and the Opposition, and the latter The effects of these interventions, which also tended to consolidate caste votes, (some of which were perceived as merely social improvements), generally intensified inter-ethnic conflicts....”[8]  India-Pakistan war  In 1965, when the Indo-Pakistani war was going on, Indira Gandhi was resting on the outskirts of Srinagar. He refused to go to Jammu or Delhi, despite being warned by the army that Pakistani militants were infiltrating too close to the city. Instead, he mobilized local government and attracted media attention. The Pakistani offensive was successfully repulsed and in January 1966 in Tashkent, in the presence of Russia, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri signed a peace treaty with Pakistan's Ayub Khan. A few hours later, Shastri died of a heart attack.[9] Later, despite Morarji Desai's opposition, Indira Gandhi was made Prime Minister by Indian National Congress leader K. Kamaraj was instrumental. Morarji Desai was later defeated by members of the Congress Parliamentary Party, in which Indira Gandhi defeated Morarji Desai by 355 to 169 votes to become the fifth Prime Minister of India and the first woman to hold the title. Chief Minister First term When Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister in 1966, the Congress was divided into two factions, the communalists led by Gandhi and the conservatives led by Morarji Desai. Ram Manohar Lokia called Indira Gungi Gudiya, meaning 'deaf doll'.[10] These infighting echoed in the 1967 elections, in which the Congress won 297 of the 545 seats and lost 60 by a narrow margin. Indira Morarji had to appoint Desai as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of India. In 1969, after several disagreements with Desai, the Indian National Congress broke up. For the next two years he ruled with the support of the socialist and communist parties. In the same year, in July 1969, he nationalized the banks. 1971 war with Pakistan  The Pakistan Army carried out widespread atrocities against the indigenous population of East Pakistan.[11][12] An estimated 10 million refugees came to India, leaving the country financially strapped and unstable. Indira Gandhi declared war on Pakistan to solve the refugee problem and help East Pakistanis achieve their independence. The US under Richard Nixon supported Pakistan and passed a resolution in the United Nations to warn India for starting a war. Nixon personally hated Indira. In a secret conversation with his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (now released by the State Department), Nixon referred to Indira as a ""witch"" and a ""trick fox"". [13]. Indira signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. This paved the way for political support in the United Nations and a Soviet veto power. 1971 India wins war with Pakistan and Bangladesh is formed. foreign policy  Indira invited Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's new president, to Shimla for a week-long conference. After many-failed rounds of talks, the two heads of state eventually signed the Shimla Accord. Both countries agreed to resolve the Kashmir issue through negotiations and peace. Indira's relations with the US were strained because of her hatred of Nixon. Meanwhile relations with the Soviet Union grew closer. Indira Gandhi was criticized by some for not making India's Line of Control with Pakistan a permanent border, with some critics even saying that Pakistan-controlled Kashmir should have been separated from Pakistan. 93,000 prisoners of war in the region were under Indian control. But the accord immediately lifted the United Nations and third-country sanctions, and greatly reduced Pakistan's willingness to launch a major offensive in the immediate future. Without demanding Bhutto's full capitulation on a major issue, Indira allowed Pakistan to stabilize and moderate. Trade relations were also moderated, even as many contacts remained frozen (closed) for years. Revaluation of rupee In the late 1960s, Indira's administration decreed a 40% revaluation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar from 4 to 7 to boost trade. Nuclear weapons program A National Nuclear Program was launched in 1967 to respond to the threat of nuclear weapons from the People's Republic of China and to keep India's stability and security interests independent from nuclear powers. In 1974, India successfully conducted an underground nuclear test at Pokhran in Rajasthan, presumably with the codename ""Smiling Buddha"". With the announcement that the test was for peaceful purposes, India became the world's youngest nuclear power. green Revolution  Special agricultural innovation programs and additional government assistance, finally introduced in the 1960s, alleviated India's chronic food shortages. It led to increased production of wheat, rice, cotton and milk. Nixon Instead of receiving food subsidies from the US led India became a food exporter. This achievement with its commercial crop production has been called the ""Green Revolution"". At the same time, revolutionary changes in milk and egg production to help combat malnutrition, especially among young children, were called the White Revolution. The so-called 'Food Security' program helped Indira Gandhi in the years up to 1975.[14] The Green Revolution was the name given to the District Agricultural Extension Programme, developed in the early 1960s. It promised the urban dwellers abundant, precious grains. All politicians including Gandhi sought their support.[15] The project had four preambles: New varieties of seeds, Acceptance of the need for chemicalization in Indian agriculture i.e. fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides etc. Suitable for national and international collaboration to develop new and improved existing seed varieties Plan to expand science and agriculture courses in colleges of higher education.[16] After about ten years of persistence, the program finally brought about a tripling of wheat production and a small but significant rise in rice production. There was little increase in the yield of cereals like millets, cloves and coarse grains. In fact, these maintained consistent yields as reported. 1971 election victory and second term (1971–1975) After a landslide victory in the 1971 general elections, Indira's government faced major problems. The internal structure of the Congress party followed its innumerable splits, and the party came under Indira's complete control. Karibi Hatao (Eliminate Poverty) was Indira Gandhi's 1971 concept. This campaign and the accompanying poverty alleviation programs, based on the rural and urban poor, gave Indira an independent national support. This prevented the rural castes and urban gentry, who were influential in both state and local government, from influencing politics. Also, the previously voiceless poor eventually gained their share of political influence and political power. Although implemented locally, the programs developed through the poverty alleviation policy were funded, expanded, monitored and staffed by New Delhi and the Indian National Congress. ""These plans provided the impetus for new and broader support resources... to be expended across the country to make the program a success.""[17]. Academic researchers and historians now agree on the failure of the Karibi Hatao program to eradicate poverty. That is, about 4 percent of the total funds were earmarked for economic development and given to three poverty alleviation programs. Not even a fraction of it in value ever reaches the 'poor and poor'. Instead, the mere clamor of the program was used to mobilize popular support for Indira Gandhi's re-election. Allegations of corruption and adjudication of electoral malpractice In 1971, Raj Naren filed an election fraud case against Indira in the Allahabad High Court. Raj Narine, along with Indira Gandhi, was influential in post-independence Indian politics. Indira always fought against him. He was accused of many large and small incidents of using government resources for election campaign.[18] Indira Gandhi had defeated the opposition in the 1971 parliamentary elections. Indira Gandhi, who gave evidence in her defense during the trial, was found guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenses and use of government machinery and officials for the benefit of the party. The judge dismissed the grand corruption charges against him. The judgment was delivered after four years in the case brought by Raj Naren. On 12 June 1975, the Allahabad High Court declared that Indira Gandhi's election to the Lok Sabha was based on irregularities. Justice Singha had delivered the verdict. (After Indira was convicted of electoral malpractices against Raj Naren in 1971, who defeated Indira in the Raebareli constituency in 1977), the court ordered that Indira should be removed from parliament. It also banned him from contesting elections for six years. The Chief Minister must be a member of either the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian Parliament) or the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament). Thus, this decision deposed him. But Indira Gandhi rejected calls to step down and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. Although she was about to be removed from the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, by a court order, Indira said the verdict would not undermine her position. He said, ""There is a lot of talk that our government is not clean, but our experience is that if {opposition} parties form governments, the situation will be much worse."" He dismissed the criticism saying that his Congress party followed the same method used by all parties for election campaign funding. Indira retained the support of the party, which issued a statement in her favour. As news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters gathered in front of his house to show their solidarity. Indira Gandhi's verdict will not affect her political career, Indian High Commissioner P.K. Nehru said. ""Mrs. Indira Gandhi still enjoys continued support in the country,"" he said. ""I believe the Prime Minister of India will continue in office unless the Indian electorate decides,"" he said. Protests and civil strife Even as Indira announced her decision to ""continue to serve the people till her last breath""[19], the opposition parties and their supporters, keen to make political capital out of the situation, staged massive rallies demanding her resignation. Strikes by unions and protesters in many states brought life to a standstill. To strengthen the protest, Jaya Prakash Narayan asked the police not to disobey orders if they were asked to fire on innocent public gatherings. Public disillusionment with Indira's government and bad economic times combined. A large crowd of protesters gathered in front of his house in Delhi and around the Parliament building demanding his resignation. Indira was already accused of bureaucracy. Using his strong parliamentary majority, his ruling Congress party had reformed the political system. It shifted the devolution between the Center and the States in favor of the Central Government. He twice brought in President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution, saying the opposition-ruled states were ""lawless and barbaric"". Also, elected officials and civil servants resented the growing influence of Sanjay Gandhi, Indira's closest political adviser. Before Indira came to power, Indira's advisor B. N. Aksar was replaced by Sanjay Gandhi. In response to her new tendency to wield power, civic leaders and former freedom fighters like Jaya Prakash Narayan, Satyendra Nath Sinha and Acharya Kripalani toured the country speaking out against Indira and her government. National Emergency (1975–1977)  Indira filed an appeal against her conviction for electoral malpractice. And he ironically declared a state of emergency, saying there was a plan to disrupt democracy. Thousands were arrested, including about 20 Union ministers. Indian media is censored. In August 1975, a bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha to acquit him of corruption charges, after taking the opposition out of Parliament in armed force and arresting many. Indira Gandhi tried to maintain the mandate by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition who participated in the protests. Later, due to the chaos and lawlessness that followed the Allahabad High Court decision, Indira's cabinet and government asked President Bakruddin Ali Ahmed to declare a state of emergency in the country. Accordingly, on 26 June 1975, the President declared a state of emergency in the country on account of civil disorder under Article 352 of the Constitution. Within months, President's rule was introduced in both the opposition-ruled states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. This brought the entire country under central rule.[20] The police were empowered to impose curfews. Citizens were detained indefinitely. All publications of news and media were censored to a large extent by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Information and Broadcasting Minister Inder Kumar Gujral resigned against Sanjay Gandhi's interference in his work. Later Inder Kumar Gujral served as the Chief Minister of India. Finally, the upcoming assembly elections were postponed indefinitely. Along with this, all opposition-controlled governments were removed using the political system clause that allows state governments to be dissolved on the recommendation of the state governor. Indira used emergency laws to get more powers for herself.  ""Unlike her father (Nehru), who wanted to be controlled by strong Chief Ministers and associated with their political parties and state party organizations, Mrs. Gandhi expelled every Congress Chief Minister who had an independent base. And replaced them with ministers who favored her personally...However, in the states Instability could not be sustained...”[21]  Rule by judgment Indira is also accused of having President Ahmad issue decrees that did not require debate in Parliament to allow for tribunal rule. At the same time, Indira's government embarked on a campaign to stamp out dissent, including the arrest and detention of thousands of political activists. Sanjay was instrumental in clearing the slums around the Jama Masjid in Delhi under the watchful eye of Jag Mohan (who was later made the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi). Thousands of people were displaced and hundreds were killed as a result of this action. This sparked outrage among the local community in the nation's capital and the forced family planning program on thousands of fathers' seed days. These were often poorly managed. Elections After twice extending the state of emergency, Indira Gandhi called elections in 1977 to give the electorate a chance to justify her rule. The heavily censored press wrote what they wanted to write about him. Reading it grossly misjudged his influence. In any case, he was opposed by the Janata Party. His long-standing opposition Janata Party, along with its leader Morarji Desa and spiritual mentor Jai Prakash Narayan, declared the election to be India's last chance to choose a good ruler between ""democracy and dictatorship"". Indira's Congress party suffered a heavy defeat in this election. Both Indira and Sanjay lost their constituencies. Also, the Congress won only 153 seats (compared to 350 seats in the previous Lok Sabha), of which 92 were from the south. Removal, arrest and reinstatement  In 1969, Morarji Desai was sworn in as the Chief Minister and Neelam Sanjeevi Reddy as the President of the Indian political system. By the time Indira Gandhi won the 1978 by-election, she found herself without a job, income or a place to live. Congress broke up during the 1977 election campaign. Indira's most important former supporters like Jagjivan Ram, Bahuguna and Nandini Satpati defected. All three were very close to Indira but were forced out by the circumstances and political maneuvering created by Sanjay Gandhi. It was later rumored that Sanjay wanted to undermine Indra's influence. Despite being the official opposition party at the time, the Congress (Indira) party was a very small group in Parliament. Unable to govern between various alliance conflicts, Chaudhry Charan Singh, the Home Minister of the Janata government, ordered the arrest of Indira and Sanjay Gandhi on several charges. None of these charges could be easily proved in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Indira would automatically be expelled from Parliament. However, this approach backfired disastrously. His arrest and lengthy trial won him great sympathy among people who had seen him as a tyrant two years earlier. The Janata Alliance was united only by its hatred of Indira (or ""that lady"", as she was called by many). With the majority in the minority, the government was mired in infighting. Indra was able to use this situation to his advantage. Presumably regretting the ""mistakes"" he had made during the Emergency, he resumed making statements. Morarji Desai resigned in June 1979 and Reddy appointed Charan Singh as Chief Minister following Indira's assurance that the Congress would provide external support to the Charan Singh government. After a short hiatus, Indira regained her initial support, and in the winter of 1979 President Reddy dissolved Parliament. In the elections that followed in January, the Congress returned to power with a large majority. In the 1980s, Indira Gandhi's government provided money, arms and military training to the LTTE and other Tamil militant groups in Sri Lanka. [22] Third term Currency crisis During the early 1980s, Indira's administration failed to stem the 40 percent fall in the value of the Indian rupee from 7 to 12 against the US dollar.

Massacre  The subsequent military operations angered Indira among the Sikhs. As a result, he was shot dead by two of his own bodyguards, both Sikhs. Indira Gandhi had innumerable bodyguards. Two of them were Satwant Singh and Bind Singh, both Sikhs. They assassinated Indira Gandhi with their service weapons on October 31, 1984, at the Chief Minister's residence at No. 1, Saptarjung Road, New Delhi. To be interviewed for a documentary by British actor Peter Ustinov for Irish television, Indira passed through the wicket gate guarded by Satwant and Pint. According to reports immediately following the incident, Pind Singh shot him three times with his sidearm, while Satwant Singh fired 30 rounds[25] from a Sten submachine gun. Bind Singh was shot dead by his other guards, while Satwant Singh was shot and arrested. Indira died en route while being taken to hospital in her government car, but was not pronounced dead for several hours. He was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where doctors examined him. An official report said he had 29 penetrating wounds at the time, while some reports said 31 bullets had been removed from his body. He was cremated on November 3 near Rajgat. After her death, disaffected factions were formed by Congress politicians worthy of Indira Gandhi's credit that surrounded New Delhi. Bubul Jayakar, Gandhi's friend and biographer, revealed Indira's nervousness and her apprehension about what would happen as a result of Operation Bluestar. own life Nehru-Gandhi family  Initially Sanjay was his chosen successor; But after his death in a plane crash, Indira urged a reluctant Rajiv Gandhi to quit his job as a pilot and enter politics in February 1981. After Indira Gandhi's death, Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister. In May 1991, he was also assassinated, killed by a LTTE human bomb while he was participating in a public meeting in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. Rajiv's wife Sonia Gandhi headed the United Progressive Alliance after a surprise electoral victory in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. Sonia Gandhi refused to accept the post of Prime Minister of India, but the Congress controlled the political machinery; Former Finance Minister Manmohan Singh now heads the Indian Cabinet. Rajiv's children Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra have also entered politics. Sanjay Gandhi's widow, Maneka Gandhi (who after Sanjay's death was separated from Indira and was famously kicked out of the Prime Minister's house)[26] and Sanjay's son Varun Gandhi are active in politics as members of the main opposition BJP. Contradictions The late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi introduced a mandatory sterilization program in the 1970s that officially required men with two or more children to sterilize themselves. But many unmarried youths, political dissidents and ignorant men were also believed to have been sterilized. In India, the scheme is still remembered and criticized. And it has been accused of creating a false public aversion to family planning. This put the government's plans in jeopardy for several years.[27] See also these Prime Ministers of India List of famous Indians Additional reading Ved Mehta, A Family Affair: India Under Three Prime Ministers (1982) ISBN 0-19-503118-0 Bhubul Jayakar, Indira Gandhi: A Classic Biography (1992) ISBN 9780679424796 Katherine Frank, Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru ISBN 0-395-73097-X Ramachandra Guha, After Gandhi and Indira: A History of the World's Largest Democracy (2007) ISBN 978-0-06-019881-7 Quotations  External links              | Prime Minister of India 1980–1984 | Succeededby Rajiv Gandhi |-hjtjg |- |Precededby Pamulaparthi Venkata Narasimha Rao | Minister of External Affairs of India 1984–1984 | Succeededby Rajiv Gandhi |- |}   Category:Prime Ministers of India Category:Indian National Congress Category:Bharat Ratna Awardees Category:1917 Births Category:1984 Deaths Category:Nehru-Gandhi Family Category:Indian women in politics Category:Indian Hindus Category:Indian politicians Category:Assassined Heads of State Category:Prime Ministers of India Category:Women in History Category:Ministers of External Affairs of India Category:Finance Ministers of India Category:Lenin Peace Laureates Category:Politicians murdered in India Category:Women Heads of Government Category:Members of 4th Lok Sabha Category:Twentieth century Indian politicians ",When was Indira Gandhi born?,19 November 1917,3971
"Malaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy in Southeast Asia. Consisting of 13 states and three tropical zones, Malaysia is divided by the South China Sea into two regions: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia shares land and sea borders with Thailand to the north, Singapore to the south, Vietnam to the northeast, and Indonesia to the west. East Malaysia shares land and sea borders with Brunei, Indonesia, and the Philippines and Vietnam. The capital and largest city of Malaysia is Kuala Lumpur. Putrajaya is the administrative capital of the Central Government. With a population of over 30 million, Malaysia is the 44th most populous country in the world. Tanjung Piai, the southern tip of the Eurasian continent, is located in Malaysia. Located in the tropics, Malaysia is one of the 17 most biodiverse countries and has a large number of breeding species. The total area of ​​Malaysia is 329,847 square kilometers (127,350 sq mi). Peninsular Malaysia alone has a population of 20 million. Currently the population of Malaysia is 2.5 crore. Majority of them are Malays. Next to them, Chinese and Indians also live. The majority of Malaysians follow Islam. Islam is also the national religion of Malaysia. Malay is the national language. It gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957. Now the reigning King of Malaysia is Muhammad V. It ranked second in the list of countries with the fastest economic growth in the twentieth century. After the 14th general election held on 9 May 2018, Mahathir bin Mohammed was sworn in as the 7th Prime Minister of Malaysia on 10 May 2018.[12] History Prehistoric times Prehistoric evidence is abundant in Malaysia. Stone weapons dating back 2 lakh years have been found in Bukit Java. Neah Caves, located in Sarawak, East Malaysia, are home to human remains dating back 40,000 years. The ancestors of the aboriginal Semang people are thought to have been Africans from about 40,000 years ago. Perak Man, the earliest known skeleton from Peninsular Malaysia, is 11,000 years old. It was discovered at Lenggong. Early period BC Merchants and settlers from India and China established trading ports and cities in the early first century. Later, Malaysia was under the rule of the Sri Vijaya Empire. There are historical evidences that the Chola King Rajendra Chola won a battle in a place called Kadaram in the 11th century. Over the next 20 years, the Cholas made a series of invasions of Sumatra and the Malayan Peninsula. The arrival and wars of the Cholas weakened Srivijaya rule. Sultans Various sultans ruled from the beginning of the fifteenth century. Parameswaran, a prince of the Sri Vijaya Empire, established the Malacca Sultanate, considered the first independent kingdom of the Malayan Peninsula. Parameswaran converted to Islam. During this period, Islam spread rapidly. Malacca also became an important trading center during this period. European settlement regimes Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511. Then in 1641 it was captured by the Dutch (English). In 1786, the Sultan of Kedah leased Penang to the British East India Company. Thus the British Empire established itself in Malaya. The British conquered Singapore in 1819. And in 1824 they brought Malacca under their control as per the Anglo-Dutch treaty. In 1826, the British brought Penang, Malacca, Singapore and Labuan Islands directly under their control, making them their final colonies. Sappan ruled from 1943–1945 during World War II. During this period ethnic issues arose and nationalism prevailed. Britain came back to power after the war. And Britain consolidated the administration of Malaya into a single final settlement called the Federation of Malaya. However, the Malays opposed this. Also under the leadership of the Malayan Commonwealth (Communist) Party, the united fighters waged a guerilla war against the British forces. Contemporary Malaysia gained independence on 31 August 1957 and in 1963 became the modern Malaysian state known as the Federation of Malaysia. In 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became an independent country. After the ethnic riots of 1969, a controversial new economic policy was introduced aimed at giving the indigenous people known as Bhumiputra an equal share in economic development. It is noteworthy that in the recent past, minority Indians have been protesting that they are being neglected. In November 2007 and February 2008, large crowds tried to gather and protest, but were dispersed by police with tear gas. Regimes   Malaysia is a confederation of 13 states and three federal territories. These are divided into two regions. Peninsular Malaysia has 11 states and two federal territories and East Malaysia has two states and one federal territory. The governance of the states is devolved between the central and state governments and the federal territories are administered by the central government.[13] All 13 states are centered around historically formal Malay kingdoms. 9 of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia are ruled by their hereditary rulers and are known as Malay states. Their monarch is elected by them from a council of nine rulers for a five-year term.[14] Each state has a single house called the state legislature. The states in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) have their own immigration policies and restrictions.[15] Accordingly, the rest of Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia) is considered foreign under immigration laws.[16] Each state is divided into districts and districts are further divided into villages. In Sabah and Sarawak, the districts are grouped into divisions.[17] The Malaysian Parliament has the power to resolve issues arising in the areas of land, Islamic religion and local government to provide equal justice to all states. It also has the power to intervene in the administration of a state at its request. Except for some land-related laws, the states themselves look after the issues occurring within the states. Under the country's law, non-Islamic issues are managed at the national level in compliance with the Malaysia Agreement.[18] Geography  Malaysia is the 67th largest country with a total land area of ​​3,29,847 square kilometers.

"Delhi or Delhi (Hindi: دیلی, Punjabi: دیلی, Urdu: دیلی) is the second largest city in India. It is one of the three cities in the National Capital Region. The other two cities are New Delhi and Delhi Cantonment. The National Capital Region is the eighth most populous city in the world with a population of 11 million. It is administered by a central government. Located on the banks of the Yamuna River in northern India, this city has been a residential area for a long time. BC Archaeological evidence of people living in the area dates back to the sixth century AD. After the rise of the Delhi Sultanate, the city emerged as an important political, cultural and commercial city on the trade route between northwest India and the Indus-Gangetic plains. Here, a large number of ancient and medieval monuments and archaeological sites are located. In 1639, the Mughal emperor Shahjahan established a walled city here. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857. After most of India came under the control of the British East India Company in the 18th and 19th centuries, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) was their headquarters. This continued under the Company's rule and then for some time under the British Government. In 1911, King George V announced the transfer of the capital to Delhi. In the 1920s, a new capital known as New Delhi was built south of Old Delhi. After India's independence in 1947, it was declared the capital and seat of government. Due to the migration of people from different parts of the country, Delhi became a multi-ethnic city. The high average income of the people living here and the rapid growth and urbanization of Delhi have changed the city greatly. Today it is an important cultural, political and commercial center of India. Name The origin of the name Delhi is not clear. However, many reasons are given for the origin of this name. By a Mauryan king named Dillu or Dilu in 100 BC. Most believe that the city founded in the region in 50 AD was named Delhi after him. Another theory is that the foundation of an iron pillar erected here by King Dava was unstable and the city was called Dili which means loosening in Hindi / Prakrit and hence the name Delhi. During the time of the Rajput kings, the coin that circulated in the region was called Tehliwal. Some scholars believe that the name is derived from the words Tehlis or Tehali, meaning mouth. They suggest that the name may have been derived from the fact that it served as a gateway to the Indus-Gangetic Plain region. Others are of the opinion that the initial name of the city was Delhi. History     According to the archaeological evidence found so far in Delhi and its surrounding areas BC. Settlements appear to have existed in the second millennium and earlier. Indraprastam, the capital of the Pandavas in the famous Indian epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been situated in this region. These settlements flourished during the Mauryan Empire (300 BC). Remains of seven major cities have been found in the Delhi area. The Tomara family established the city of Lal Ghat in AD 736. The Chauhan Rajputs or Ajmer as they are known captured the city of Lal Ghat in 1180 AD and renamed it as Gila Rai Pithora. The Chauhan king Prithiviraj III was defeated by the Afghan Muhammad Khori in 1192. In 1206, Qutb-ud-Din Aibag, who started the Ghulam dynasty, established the Delhi Sultanate. Qutb-ud-Din built the Qutb Minar and the oldest mosque in India known as Quad Al Islam. After the fall of the Ghulam dynasty, Khilji, Tughlaq, Sayyid, Lodi, and other Turkic and Central Asian dynasties ruled one after the other. They built many forts and townships, including seven cities in Delhi. The Timur League entered India in 1398, accusing the Muslim Sultans of Delhi of being lenient towards their Hindu subjects.

The Mughal Empire lasted three centuries in northern India, except for the five-year reign of Sher Shah Suri in the mid-16th century. Emperor Akbar shifted the capital from Agra to Delhi. Today, it was Emperor Shahjahan who built the seventh city of Delhi, commonly known as Old Delhi. Then the city was named Shahjakhanabad after the emperor. Old Delhi was the capital of the Mughal Empire since 1638. In February 1739, Nadar Shah defeated the Mughal forces at the Battle of Karnal and captured Delhi. He plundered Delhi and took many valuables including peacocks. After the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, Ahmed Shah Abdali captured Delhi. On 11 September 1803, the British forces led by General Lake Enbar defeated the Marathas in the Battle of Delhi and captured the city. After the Indian Mutiny of 1857, Delhi came under the direct control of the British. Shortly after this, Calcutta became the capital of British India. Delhi became a district of Punjab province. In 1911, Delhi was declared the capital of British India. Following this, a group led by British architect Edwin Lutyens began designing a new political and administrative capital to build government buildings. This new city, New Delhi, became the capital of British India. It continued to be the capital even after the independence of India on 15 August 1947. During the Partition of India, a large number of Muslims migrated from Delhi to Pakistan, while a large number of Hindus and Sikhs migrated to Delhi from the provinces of West Punjab and Sindh. The Constitution of India (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 formally declared the Union Territory of Delhi as the National Capital Territory of Delhi. According to this act, an assembly with limited powers was also constituted for the area.

Marina Beach in Chennai is one of the longest beaches in the world. Chennai is the home of the Tamil film industry known as Kollywood. Many sports competitions are also held in Chennai which has many sports arenas. Bangalore   Bengaluru (Kannada: बंगालोरु,) is the capital of the state of Karnataka. Located on the Deccan Plateau in the southeastern part of Karnataka, Bengaluru is India's third most populous metropolis[7] and fifth largest in terms of urban population density. Many consider the city's modern history to begin in 1537, when Kempe Gowda, considered by many to be the architect of modern Bangalore, built a brick-and-mortar fort on the site and established it as a region of the Vijayanagara Empire. During the British rule, it became the center of colonial rule in South India. Hyderabad   Hyderabad (Telugu: HYDERABAD, Urdu: HYDERABAD‎) is the most populous capital of the state of Andhra Pradesh in southern India. The city is famous as ""City of Pearls"" and City of Nizams. Hyderabad has a population of over 4 million. Hyderabad is classified as an A-1 city based on the city's area, population and growth impact.[8] Ahmedabad  Pune   Pune (Marathi: पुने) formerly known as Punawadi or Punya-nagari or Poona) is the ninth largest city in India and the largest city in Maharashtra after Mumbai. Located at the confluence of the Mulla and Mutha rivers, Pune city is the administrative capital of Pune district. [9] Today, Pune is known as a city of educational facilities with more than one hundred educational institutions and seven universities [10] and Pune is also known for various cultural activities such as classical music, sports, literature, foreign language teaching, administration, economics and social science studies. Such activities and employment opportunities attract expatriates and students from all over India, as well as students from the Middle East, Iran, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, etc., making it a multi-community and multicultural city. Most people use their own vehicles (mostly two-wheelers) as the city has poor public transport.

"Germany (Germany, [ˈdʒɜːmənɪ]), or the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland, IPA:[ˈbʊndəsʁepuˌbliːk ˈdɔʏtʃlant]), is a country in Central Europe. North of this is the North Sea, Denmark, the Baltic Sea; Poland, Czech Republic to the east; Austria, Switzerland to the south; It is bordered by France, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands to the west. The area of ​​Germany is 357,021km². With a population of 82 million, it is the most populous member state of the European Union and the third most immigrated[1]. Germany was divided into East Germany and West Germany from 1949 to 3 October 1990. East-Berlin was the capital of East-Germany and Bonn was the capital of West-Germany. The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 to separate West-Berlin from East-Berlin and East-Germany. In 1989 the Axis was broken and Berlin became the capital of a reunified Germany. Germany is now a federal parliamentary republic of 16 states (Länder). Its capital is Berlin. It is also the largest city of the country. AD in the area known as Germania. There is evidence of Germanic settlement as early as 100 BC. During the Migration Period, Germanic groups spread further south and established successful kingdoms throughout Europe. By the early 10th century, the Germanic territories were the heartland of the Holy Roman Empire.[2] In the 16th century, the northern German regions became the center of the Protestant Reformation. However, the southern and western regions remained Roman Catholic. This led to the Thirty Years' War and the beginning of the Catholic-Protestant schism. It has also determined the character of German society ever since.[3] During the Napoleonic Wars, nationalism rose in Germanic regions. Thus, in 1871, most of the German territories emerged as the German Empire, led by Prussia. Following the German Revolution of 1918–1919 and the surrender in World War I, the Parliamentary Weimar Republic was established in 1918. And parts of it were alienated as per the Treaty of Versailles. Although many advances were made in the fields of science and art during this period, the Third Monarchy was proclaimed in 1933 due to massive economic crisis. After this Nazi policies spread in the country. This led to World War II. After 1945, Germany was divided into two by the Allies. These were called East Germany and West Germany. Germany was reunified in 1990. Germany also participated in the creation of the European Community in 1957. It became the European Union in 1993. It became part of the Schengen Area and, since 1999, a member of the Euro Area. Germany is a member of United Nations, NATO, G8, G20, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and European Union. It is also a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2011-2012. Germany is the world's fourth largest economy by GDP and fifth by purchasing power. Germany is the world's third largest exporter and third largest importer. It is seen as a country with a high standard of living and a country with social security. Germany also has one of the oldest healthcare systems in the world. Many great philosophers, composers, scientists and inventors lived in Germany. Also, its cultural and political history is rich. Etymology The English word Germany comes from the Latin Germania; Julius Caesar used the term to refer to the people who lived east of the Rhine.[4] In particular, the Chal tribes brought them to Germany. It was from this that the Romans began to use the name Germany to refer to the people who lived east of the Rhine and north of the Danube.[5] The Italian word Idaichuland comes from the Archaic Germanic root *theodo; It means ""people, race, nation"". It was a broad term used to refer to the vernacular</i>of the Germanic people. It does not specifically mention the Cherumani language or people. When the term was first used (late 8th century) it referred to the language of the Kingdom of Mercia; In fact that language is Old English.[6] Later, various ethnicities also sought to establish their own identity; The people of the British Isles were the Anglo-Saxons, the Angles later known as the English. They are distinguished by scholars of ancient Germany as ""Bavarians"", ""Saxons"" or ""Isubians"".[7] These terms originated with internal rulers who ruled large territories. [8] When the Holy Roman Empire broke up, such distinct identities disappeared and the hitherto unnamed Germanic ethnic groups were called based on the term *theudo' in their dialects. Thus, in the 13th century, Theudixland (Deutschland, Cerumani) came into circulation.[9][10] History Prehistoric period The Mayuvar 1 jawbone discovered in 1907 shows that Cerumani was inhabited by archaic people as early as 600,000 years ago.[11] The world's oldest complete set of hunting tools was discovered in 1995 at Isoningen in Germany; Three 6-7.5-foot-long wooden javelins dating back 380,000 years were found.[12] Early human fossils have been found in the Neander Valley (Valley is called Tal in Cherumanii) at Cerumani; In 1856 it was recognized as a new human species called Neanderthal man. These Neanderthal fossils are estimated to be 40,000 years old. Evidence of similar antiquity has been found in the Suabian Jurassic caves near the town of Ulm; 42,000-year-old bird bone, large tusk flutes found; These are the oldest musical instruments in the world.[13] The 40,000-year-old Ice Age sculpture of the Lion Man is considered the world's first form of art.[14] Germanic groups and the Frankish Empire  There is evidence of Germanic groups dating back to the Nordic Bronze Age or the pre-Roman Iron Age. They migrated from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany to BC. From the 1st century they began to spread south, east and west. Through this the Celtic groups of Gaul also came into contact with the Iranians and the Baltic and Slavic groups found in Central and Eastern Europe.[15] Under Augustus, the Roman general Publius Quintilius Varus conquered Germania (roughly the area from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains). AD In 9, three Roman legions led by Varusus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius. Around AD 100, when Tacius wrote Germania, Germanic groups settled along the Rhine and Danube rivers (Limes Germanicus), most of modern-day Germany. However, Austria, southern Bavaria and the western Rhineland remained Roman provinces.[16] In the 3rd century, many West Germanic groups arose, such as the Alemanni, Franks, Chatti, Saxons, Frisians, Sigumbri and Thuringi. By the 260s, many of the Germanic peoples had come under Roman control.[17] The invasion of the Huns in 375 and the fall of the Roman Empire in 395 caused Germanic groups to move further southwest. At the same time, some large groups developed and replaced smaller Germanic groups. Huge areas (known as Austrasia from the Merovingian period) were conquered by the Franks. Also northern Germany was ruled by Saxons and Slavs.[16] Holy Roman Empire  On December 25, 800, Charlemagne, king of the Franks, was crowned emperor. He created the Carolingian Empire. It was divided in 843.[18] In its eastern part the Holy Roman Empire was formed. It stretched from the Eider River in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south.[18] Under the reign of the Ottonian emperors (919–1024), several large states were united. In 962 the Germanic king was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of the territories. During the reign of the Salian emperors (1024–1125), the Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy. Under the reign of the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), the Germanic princes established their dominance in the southern and eastern regions where the Slavs lived. This led to the establishment of Germanic settlements (Oostseetlung) in these regions and further east. North German cities developed into prosperous cities and became members of the Hanseatic League.[19] The Great Famine of 1315 and the Black Death of 1348–50 caused Germany's population to decline.[20] The Edict of the Golden Bull, written in 1356, was seen as the foundation of the empire. It mentions the system of electing the emperor through elections held by seven powerful vassals and patriarchal regions.[21] In 1517, Martin Luther published his Ninety-Five Theses in Wittenberg. Through this, he opposed the Roman Catholic Church and started the Protestant Reformation. After 1530 a separate Lutheran Church emerged as the official religion in many German regions. Religious conflict led to the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) which resulted in the destruction of German territories.[22] The population of the Germanic regions decreased by 30%.[23] The Peace of Westphalia (1648) ended the wars of religion in the German territories. However, the German Empire broke up into various independent states. By the 18th century, there were 1,800 such regions in the Holy Roman Empire.[24] From 1740 onwards, the dual rule of the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Prussian Monarchy figured prominently in German history. This authority was abolished in 1806 due to the Napoleonic wars.[25] Cerumanic Confederation and Empire   After the fall of Napoleon I, the Conference of Vienna in 1814 established the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund); It is a flexible alliance of 39 sovereign states. Disagreement with European reformist politics led to the emergence of progressive movements in Germany. The repressions of the Austrian politician Metternich intensified these protests. The Solberine customs union between the German states led to economic unity among them.[26] The national progressive ideas of the French Revolution began to gain support among many, especially young Germans. The Ambag festival in May 1832 was the primary event in favor of German unity, freedom and democracy. As a result of the series of revolutions that took place in Europe, revolutions were started in 1848 by the public and scholars in Cherumani. Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, with very limited powers; Frederick William refused to accept this and proposed a constitution. It was not conducive to protest movements.[27] Disagreement arose between King William I of England and the progressive Parliament in 1862 over military reforms. The King appointed Bismarck as the new Prime Minister. In 1864, Bismarck won the Danish War. His subsequent victory in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 helped establish the Northern German Confederation. Austria, which had previously taken the lead in German affairs, was not included in the alliance. The German Empire was proclaimed in 1871 at the Palace of Versailles when France was defeated in 1871; It includes all territories except Austria.  Prussia, with two-thirds of the new country's land area and population, was the dominant component; A Prussian king of the Oenzolarn dynasty ruled as its emperor, with Berlin as its capital.[27] Bismarck's foreign policies in the post-German unification period maintained Germany's status as a major developing country. Agreed to avoid war with France. According to the Berlin Convention of 1884, the new empire claimed Cameroonian colonies such as Cameroon.[28] Under William II of Germany, like other European countries, relations with neighboring countries were strained as he advanced to dominance. Many of the treaties Bismarck saw were not renewed; Cherumani was not included in the new alliances.[29] World War I started on June 28, 1914 after the assassination of Prince Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Cerumani, which was part of the Central Powers, lost to the Allies. Approximately two million German soldiers died in the war.[30] The German Revolution broke out in November 1918; Emperor William II and all the German states abdicated. A compromise on November 11 brought the war to an end. In June 1919, Germany agreed to the Treaty of Versailles. The Cherumanians felt this agreement was humiliating and unjust to them. Some historians believe that this was the basis for Hitler's later dominance.[31][32][33][34] The Weimar Republic and the Third Reich  At the beginning of the Cheruman revolution, Cherumani declared itself a republic. However, the struggle for devolution continued; Leftist Communism took power in Bavaria. When the revolution ended on August 11, 1919, Frederick Ebert, President of Germany, implemented the Weimar Constitution for Democracy.[35] During his reign, Cherumani faced the Belgian and French occupations, price inflation followed by inflation in 1922-23, debt restructuring scheme, new currency introduced in 1924, development of national self-reliance, artistic creations, progressive culture and economic development. However, the economic situation was stagnant and the political situation was full of unrest. Historian David Williamson describes the period from 1924 to 1929 as a ""partly stable"" period.[36] This was exacerbated by the Great Depression of 1929.  The Nationalist Party got only 18% of the votes in the 1930 federal elections. Unable to form a coalition, Prime Minister Heinrich Brunner asked President Paul von Indenberg to allow him to rule without parliamentary approval with emergency powers under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. After accepting this, Brunner embarked on massive austerity measures to reduce the impact of the Great Depression. This increased unemployment and reduced social services. By 1932 nearly 30% of German workers were unemployed.[38] In the special election held that year, the Nationalist Party won 37% of the votes; however, it was unable to form a coalition government. After unsuccessfully trying various alternative cabinets, Paul von Intenberg appointed Hitler as head of state on January 30, 1933.[39] On February 27, 1933, the German Parliament building caught fire; In this case, the Reichstag Fire Tribunal suspended basic civil rights and gave Hitler unlimited legislative power. Hitler instituted a total centralized dictatorship. He established the first concentration camps in Cherumani in February 1933. In a referendum held in September 1933, India voted to withdraw from the League of Nations. Hitler began to strengthen the military.[40] Using deficit funds, Idler employed tens of thousands of Germans in public sector projects. In August 1934, the cabinet passed a law requiring military personnel to personally swear an oath of allegiance to Hitler rather than to the country's commander-in-chief.[41] In 1934 the head of state and head of state were combined in a referendum with 90% of the vote [42] In 1935 conscription was made compulsory; withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles; The Nuremberg Laws were enacted to target Jews and other groups. In 1935, Cherumani recovered the Sar area which had been taken over by the Allies; In 1936 it sent troops into the Rhineland, which had been prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles.[43] In 1938 Austriya was acquired; In September 1939 Czechoslovakia was invaded. Later, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was established as a prelude to the invasion of Poland. The invasion of Poland took place on September 1, 1939; Soviet annexation of Poland with Red Army. The invasion was fought by the United Kingdom and France, and World War II began.[44] France reconciled with Germany on July 22, 1940, after Germany annexed most of France. The British repulsed Cherumani's attacks in 1940, known as the Battle of Britain. Cherumi invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, in violation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. At the time, Germany and other Axis powers controlled most of Europe and North Africa. After the Battle of Sudalingrad in early 1943, they began to withdraw from the Soviet Union.[44] Germany's ally Italy surrendered in September 1943; This required additional troops to fight the Allies in Italy. The D-Day landings in France opened the western front of the war; The Allied forces entered Cherumani in 1945 amid Cherumani counter-attacks. Following the Battle of Berlin and Hitler's death, the German Army surrendered on May 8, 1945.[45] 40 million people died in Europe alone in this world war, which was the bloodiest war in human history; [46] 3.25 million to 5.3 million soldiers died in the German army alone.[47] Between 1 and 3 million German civilians died.[48][49] The Nazi regime's policies targeting minorities, political and religious opponents later became known as the Great Genocide. The genocide killed 10 million civilians, including 6 million Jews, 220,000 to 1,500,000 Romani people, 275,000 mentally ill/disabled people, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political or religious dissidents.[50] In addition, six million Ukrainians and Poles and an estimated 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war perished under Nazi rule.  Defeat in the war resulted in the loss of Cherumani territories and the expulsion of millions of Cherumani from eastern parts of Cherumani and occupied countries. After World War II, some Nazis were tried and convicted at the Nuremberg Tribunal for crimes such as genocide.[51] East and West Germany  After the surrender of Germany, the remnants of Germany and Berlin were divided into four military occupation zones by the Allies of World War II. These zones accommodated more than 6.5 million ethnic Cherumanians who had been expelled from the eastern regions.[52] The Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Bundesrepublik Deutschland) was formed on May 23, 1949, uniting territories controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States; On October 7, 1949, the Soviet zone was declared the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (Deutsche Demokratische Republik). These were informally known as ""West Germany"" and ""East Germany"". East Berlin became the capital of East Germany; Bonn became the temporary capital of West Germany.[53] Reconstruction assistance was provided under the Marshall Plan to the Federal Republic of Germany.  West Germany operated as a democratic republic based on a market economy along with the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. Konrad Adenaar was elected as its first Chancellor in 1949. He remained in this position till 1963. Western Armenia joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1955. East Ceremonies functioned under the political and military control of the Soviet Union as the Eastern Conference. Although East Cherumania declared itself democratic, political power was vested in Politburo members from the Communist Party of Cherumania Socialist Unity.[54] A Soviet-style planned economy was set up; Eastern Cherumani was later incorporated into the Kamkhan state.[55] The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. It became a symbol of the Cold War.[27] So the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, following democratic transitions in Poland and Hungary, was seen as a symbol of German reunification and Die Wente (the turn). On September 12, 1990, the Two+Four Agreement was signed and the four occupied territories were merged and Cherumani became fully sovereign. This led to German reunification on October 3, 1990.[27] German Reunification and the European Union  On March 10, 1994, the Berlin/Bonn Act reinstated Berlin as the capital of a unified Germany; The city of Bonn was given the status of Bundesstadt (federal city) in its own right. Some ministries operate here.[56] The transfer of government was completed in 1999.[57] After reunification, Germany has been actively involved in the European Union and NATO. In 1999, it sent a peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia during political crisis. It also sent troops to NATO's efforts to provide security to Afghanistan against the Taliban.[58] These have been controversial as they violate German laws requiring the security forces to be used only for the defense of the country.[59] In 2005 Angela Merkel was elected as the first female head of state of Germany.[27] Geography Cerumani is located in Western and Central Europe. Most of it lies between latitudes 47° and 55°W and longitudes between 5° and 16°K. With an area of ​​357,021 sq km (137,847 sq mi), the country covers 349,223 sq km (134,836 sq mi) of land and 7,798 sq km (3,011 sq mi) of water. Germany is the 7th largest country in Europe and the 62nd largest country in the world by area. Elevation decreases steeply from the Alps in the south to the North Sea coast in the northwest and the Baltic Sea coast in the northeast. Large rivers such as the Rhine, Danube, and Elbe flow through the forested highlands of Central Germany and the lowlands of Northern Germany. Although glaciers can be found in the Alpine region, they are now melting away. Iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural resources, salt, nickel, arable land and water are the significant natural resources of Cerumani. Heatstroke Most parts of Cherumani have a subtropical monsoon climate dominated by moist westerly winds. Biodiversity Cerumani subregions can be divided into two subregions. These are the European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and the Northeast-Atlantic strata oceanic regions. As of 2008, 34% of Cherumani's land area is cultivated land and 30.1% is forested. Only 13.4% is permanent grassland. 11.8% are residential and roads. Plants and animals common to Central Europe are also found here. One third of Cherumani's forests are made up of deciduous trees like ""beech"", ""oak"". Conifers are becoming more abundant due to reforestation efforts. In the high mountain areas, there is an abundance of spruce and fir trees. In sandy areas, tree species such as ""Pine"", ""Larch"" are found. There are also many types of ferns, flowering plants, fungi and mosses. The wild animals here include deer, wild boar, jackal, porcupine and hare. There are also water railways to a lesser extent. States of Cerumani    Noterein - Westphalia has a high population-density. Frankfurt in the state of Hesse is the commercial capital of Germany. The headquarters and aircraft depot of the national airline 'LuFrancesa' are also located here. It is noteworthy that composer Beethoven was born in Bonn.  German language  The most spoken language in Germany is German. It is also the national language. It has the same alphabet as English but has a very different sound [60]. Additionally there are letters like ä,ö,ü,ß. The dot above these letters is called 'um-laut'. Nouns are derived from pal (masculine, feminine, feminine) with adjectives such as der ('der' - masculine), die ('die' - feminine), das ('das' - feminine). There are German language teaching institutes in India. Germany's famous Goethe-Institute conducts German language classes in ten major cities of India[61]. Major rivers Germany has several major rivers. The longest of these is the Rhine River at 1232 km. is long. The Elbe and Danube are the next major rivers to the Rhine. These help in domestic and foreign water transport. Economic status     Cherumi's social market economy is characterized by highly skilled labor and large capital stock, very low levels of corruption,[63] and a very high incentive to innovate.[64] The largest and most influential national economy in Europe, Germany has the fourth largest GDP in the world[65] and the fifth largest in terms of GDP.[66] In 2011, Romania was the largest net contributor to the EU's financial statements.[67] About 71% of total output comes from services, 28% from manufacturing and 1% from agriculture.[68] The national unemployment rate was officially 6.8% in April 2014.[69] This includes part-time workers seeking full-time employment.[70] India is seeking closer economic and political unity among European countries. Agreements between EU members and I.O. Its business principles are defined by law. The common currency for the European Union, the euro, was introduced on January 1, 2002.[71][72] The European Central Bank determines the monetary policy of the European Union. Two decades after German reunification, the standard of living and per capita income remained higher in the former West German regions than in the former East German regions.[73] The modernization and unification of Eastern Germany has been a long-standing process; It is estimated to last till 2019. Approximately $80 billion is exchanged annually from West to East.[74] In January 2009 the German government announced a €50 billion plan to stimulate the economy and save ailing sectors.[75] Cerumani hosts two-thirds of the world's leading business events.[76] In 2010, 37 of the world's top 500 largest publicly traded companies (Fortune Global 500) by revenue were headquartered in Kerala. Cerumani's best-known businesses include: Mercedes-Benz, BMW, SAP, Siemens, Volkswagen, Adidas, Audi, Allianz, Porsche, Bayer, Bosch, and Nivea.[77] Micro and Small Enterprises of Cherumani are known for their excellence. Such 1,000 companies that excel in their field are rated as hidden tenants.[78] Famous Germans Einstein Blank Kepler Diesel Bosch Fahrenheit Simmons Karl Benz Karl Marx Friedrich Engels Alexander von Humboldt were some of the scholars born in Germany. Casper David Frederick Michael Schumacher is a famous car racer. Beethoven was a famous classical composer. Boris Becker (Best Rennes player) Steffi Graf (Best Rennes Player) Food The food habits of Cherumanians vary from region to region. Each region has different types of food as its specialty. But everyone gives great importance to food. No food is wasted. The poverty and starvation they suffered during and after the Second World War is considered to be the reason. All kinds of food like meat, fish, eggs and vegetables are included in their cooking. They have different methods of cooking. They also pay great attention to ensure that the food is full of all the nutrients. They also eat milk, cottage cheese, fruits etc. with great attention. Potatoes are the staple food of northern Cherumanians. Potatoes are boiled, fried, fried, boiled in various ways and eaten with meat or fish. Southern Cherumanians eat noodles, spetsile (a specialty of noodles) and knoidel as staples. They have about 300 types of bread. Paani is mostly consumed as evening meal and breakfast. In the evening, they eat vegetables, pieces of meat, wooz, cheese etc. between the pans. This is called Abendbrot. In the morning it is usually eaten with butter and jam. They also add pieces of vegetable and cheese. They must have a bowl of tomato juice in their breakfast. Children must be given a bowl of milk. Cereal is a staple food in breakfast. A type of food known as Wust is loved by everyone. Kebab, a Turkish dish, is very popular among Germans. Italian food like pizza, pasta, lasagna are also popular here. There are also Indian and Chinese restaurants here. Temples in Germany Although most people in Germany follow Christianity, other religions are also supported here. A goddess temple with a tower is located in the town of Hum in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia [79]. Although there are temples in many towns in Germany, people from other states of Germany visit the temple in Hamm in large numbers because of the tower structure.

"Two Aryabhata</b>s are famous in the history of Indian mathematics. Among them, this article is about Aryabhata, who lived in the late fifth and early sixth centuries. He is also called Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder to distinguish him from the later Aryabhata II. Aryabhata (Āryabhaṭa; Vernacular: अर्यभटः, 476 ~ 550 AD) was a famous mathematician of the classical period of Indian mathematics and one of the foremost Indian astronomers. His most famous works are the Aryapattiya (499 AD, at the age of 23) and the Arya-Siddantam. No evidence has been found to accurately determine the birthplace of Aryabhatta I. However, it is known that he went to Kusumapura and studied there and lived there. Bhaskar, who addressed his book, says that this place is Pataliputra, which is today's Patna. Among the books written by Aryabhata, Aryabhattiyam and Aryabhata Siddhanta are important. The world's first book on algebra was written in India by Aryabhata in the 5th century. This is known as algebra. It contains many discoveries related to Arithmetic, Mathematics and Astronomy in the form of songs. This book continued to influence Indian mathematics for centuries to come. For this book, which was in a very condensed form, detailed texts were also given by his student Bhaskar I; In the 15th century, Nilakanda Somayaji also wrote under the name Aryapattiya Bhashyam. Life history Although the year of Aryabhata's birth is clearly stated in the Aryabhattaya, where he was born remains a mystery among scholars. Some say he was born in Ashamaga, a region of Telangana in Andhra Pradesh between the Narmada and Godavari rivers, but earlier Buddhist texts describe Ashmaga as still more southerly in the Dakshinapadati, i.e. the Deccan Plateau, and other texts place Ashamaga at war with Alexander, if that is still the case. It will be from North.[1] A recent study suggests that Aryabhatta hailed from a place called Samaravattam in Kerala. (10N51, 75E45). This study ascribes Ashamaga to Sravanabelagola, the place where the Jains lived, and which is surrounded by many stone carvings. The place Samaravattam is clearly a part of a Jain settlement in the vicinity of the Bharatapuzha river founded by the ancient Jain king Bharata. Even Aryabhata, while referring to the yugas, points to King Bharata - the fifth verse of the Dasakitika as Bharata years - how many years after King Bharata the events took place. In those days there was a famous university at Kusumapura, the Jains lived here with decision-making influence and Aryabhatta's work probably reached Kusumapura and was well received.[2][3] However, it is somewhat certain that at some point, he went to Kusumapura for higher studies and stayed there for a few days.[4] Bhaskara I (629 CE) identifies Kusumapura as Pataliputra. (Modern Patna). He lived there towards the end of the Gupta Empire, which is regarded as the golden age of India, when Buddhagupta and other minor kings came into existence, i.e. before the reign of Vishnu Gupta; At that time, the north-eastern provinces were already under attack by the Huns. Aryabhata mentions ""Lanka"" several times in the Aryapattyam, but his ""Lanka"" is a fictitious argument, referring to a point on the equator equal to the meridian of the country of Ujjain. creations Aryabhata wrote many treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which have been lost. His magnum opus, the Aryapatya, is a great compendium of mathematics and astronomy. It has been used many times in the Indian mathematical literature and has proved to be useful even in modern times. The mathematical section of Aryapattia includes Arithmetic, Arithmetic, Topical Trigonometry and Spherical Trigonometry. They also include continued fractions, the quadratic equation, the addition method of exponential series, and tables for sine angles. Arya-siddhanta, a lost work of astronomical mathematics, appears from the works of Varahamihira, a contemporary of Aryabhata, and from the works of later mathematicians and commentators, including Brahmagupta and Bhaskara I. This work seems to have adopted the ancient Surya Siddhanta, and reckons midnight-tomorrow, but contrarily reckons sunrise in the Aryapattiya. It describes a variety of instruments for astronomical research, such as a gnomon (sangu-yantra), a shadow instrument (chaya-yantra), angle-measuring instruments, semicircular and circular (danur-yantra / chakra-yantra), A rod-shaped yasti-yantra, an umbrella-like instrument called satra-yantra, and water clocks are of two types, arrow-shaped and cylindrical.[1] etc A third Aryabhata's text has also been found thanks to an Arabic translation, entitled al-Ndb or al-Nanb, but its Sanskrit name is not known. It probably dates back to the ninth century. Abu Rehan al-Biruni[1], a Persian scholar and author of Indian history, has mentioned this. Aryapattiam Direct details about Aryabhatta's work can be learned only from Aryabhattayam. Aryapattyam is attributed to later commentators, and it is unlikely that Aryabhata himself named it; He attributed it to Sedan Bhaskara I as the Ashmagatantra or Ashmaka text. Sometimes it is also called arya-shadas -ashta{/0}, Ila, 108 of Aryabhatta, which refers to the poetic lines in the text. It is written in a very eloquent sutra literary style, each line of which makes a complex system easy to memorize. Therefore, its meaning was explained by a series of commentators. Its entire text consists of 108 lines of poetry plus an additional 13 introductory lines, all of which consist of four padas or chapters. Gidikapatam: (13 lines of poetry) refers to time at large - kalpa, manvantara, yuga, all of which introduce a contemporary cosmology that contrasts with the Vedanga astrology of the earlier texts of Lakatha. (c a . first century BC). It contains a table of sine angles (jya) on a single line. A Mahayuga is defined as 4.32 million years of possible planetary cycles.

Golapadam (50 lines): Astronomical/trigonometric forms of celestial sphere, Sun's origin path (ellipse), celestial equator, node, shape of Earth, causes of day and night, writing signs of the zodiac in the lower sky, etc. and their special features. In addition, some editions added a few colophons (and other appendices) at the end of the work, which were intended to enhance the character of the work. Aryapatia introduced many innovations in mathematics and astronomy with poetic grace that remained influential for centuries. This text, which is very brief, has been taken up in detail by his disciple Bhaskara I in his Expository Conversations (Bashaya, p. 600), and Nilakanta Somaiyaji in his text Aryapattiya Bhasya (1465). Mathematics Placement method and void. The numerical arrangement system, first written in the third-century Bakshali manuscript, is clearly laid out in his work.[5] Although he did not use symbols for it, he has explained that in the work of Georges Ebrahim Aryabhata, a French mathematician, the knowledge about zero was seen as a content, and it was based on the method of placing it as a power of the higher values ​​of the number ten, and the corresponding coefficient was considered zero.[6] However, Aryabhata did not use Brahmi numerals; Since Vedic times, Sanskrit used alphabets in the traditional way, and used notational forms (like sine tables) to derive quantities.[7] Pi is an irrational number Aryabhata pie    Pi   {\displaystyle \pi }  approximated the letter , and pi    Pi   {\displaystyle \pi }  He concluded that is an irrational number. In the second part of Aryapattiyam (gaṇitapāda 10), he writes:  chaturadhikam śatamaśṭaguṇam dvāśaśṭistām sahasrāṇām ' Ayutadvayaviśkambhasyāsanno vrîttapariṇahaḥ. '' ""Add four to one hundred, multiply it by eight, and then add 62,000 to it. By this rule you can find the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 20,000."" What this means is that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is ((4+100)×8+62000)/20000 = 3.1416, and this answer fits exactly to five significant digits. Aryabhata uses the word asanna (approaching), which precedes the last word, thereby making it approximate, but its value disproportionate (or a disproportionate number). If this is correct, it shows a very sophisticated psychology, because Johann Heinrich Lambert (Lambert)) discovered the proportionality of the number pi in Europe in 1761.[8] Al-Khwarizmi's Al-Kwarizmi mentions this approximation after the Arabic translation by Aryabatiya (ca. 820 AD).[1] Metrology and Trigonometry In Mathematica 6, Aryabhata measures the area of ​​a triangle in this way Tripujachya Balasariram Samatalakodi Pujartasamvarga It means: For a triangle, multiplying half its side by its vertex gives its area.[9] Aryabhata explains the concept of sign in his work Artha-jya. Literally, it means ""half-chord"". For simplicity, people started saying it as 'jya'. When Arabic writers translated his work from Sanskrit into Arabic, they called it Jiba (due to phonetic similarity). However, in the Arabic alphabet, it was shortened to Jab due to the loss of vowels. Later writers learned that Jab was a contraction of Jiba, and changed it to Jiyab, meaning ""islet"" or ""gulf"" (Arabic, a mere technical term, Jiba being a meaningless word). Later in the 12th century, when Catherardo of Cremona translated these chapters from Arabic into Latin, he substituted the Arabic word ziyab for its Latin counterpart, sinus. (Its meaning also refers to ""small cove"" or ""bay""). Later, sine became ""sine"" in English.[10] Undifferentiated equations A great interest of Indian mathematicians since ancient times was to find solutions to equations such as ax + b =cy, known as Diophantine's equations. Here is an example from Bhaskara's commentary on Aryapattiya: When divided by eight, the remainder is 5; Dividing by nine yields 4; and to find the number whose remainder is 1 when divided by seven. So find the number that comes to N = 8x+5 = 9y+4 = 7z+1. The lowest rating for term N is 85. In general, diophantine's equations are difficult to find. Similar equations are detailed in the ancient Vedic literary text Sulabh Sutras, the oldest parts of which may date back to 800 BC. Aryabhata's method of answering this is known as the kuṭṭaka (कुत्तक) Kuttak method. Kuttak means to pulverize, i.e. to break it into small pieces and to write down the prime factors required a recursive method. Today this recursive algorithm is a canonical method for solving first-order diophantine equations, as shown by Bhaskara in 621 AD, and is known as Aryabhata's algorithm.[11] Diophantine's equation has application to cryptology, secret communication, and secrecy, and the 2006 RSA conference discussed the Kutaka method and ancient methods of easy formulas. Mathematical adverbs Aryabhattaya Vil Aryabhata Square and Cubic Series for Mathematical series Formulated the composite answer more elegantly: }[12]      1  2   +  2  2   + ⋯ +  n  2   =    n ( n + 1 ) ( 2 n + 1 )  6     {\displaystyle 1^{2}+2^{2}+\cdots +n^{2}={n(n+1)(2n+1) \over 6}}   And      1  3   +  2  3   + ⋯ +  n  3   = ( 1 + 2 + ⋯ + n  )  2     {\displaystyle 1^{3}+2^{3}+\cdots +n^{3}=(1+2+\cdots +n)^{2}}   Astronomy Aryabhatta's system of astronomy came to be known as the Audayaka system. (The count of days is morning rise, in Lanka, when dawn occurs at the equator). His later texts on astronomy, in which he proposed a second model, that model (artha-ratrika, midnight), are lost, but parts of them can be reconstructed through a discussion of Brahmagupta's Kantakadyaka Vai. In some accounts he attributed the motion of the celestial bodies to the rotation of the earth, and he predicted that the orbits of the planets were elliptical in shape. Solar system movement. Aryabhata believed that the earth rotates on its axis. This can be seen in a comment, referring to Lanka, where he described the displacement of the stars as the relative motion caused by the Earth's rotation: As a man moves forward in his boat, the fixed objects around him appear to move backwards, just as the fixed stars, when viewed from Lanka (i.e. Poo Equator), appear to move towards the fine west. [Achalani Style Samabashchimakhani - Golapadam.9]' But the following lines describe the actual movement of the stars and planets: ""The reason for their rising and setting is that the circle containing their rays and with it the temptation of the planets, driven by the vectorial wind, is constantly moving westward in Lanka"". Lanka (lit. Sri Lanka) is here a symbolic point on the equator, taken as the symbolic prime meridian for astronomical predictions. Aryabhata proposed a geocentric model of the solar system. In it both the Sun and the Moon are carried in circumpolar, ellipsoidal orbits, and orbit the Earth as they come into their respective orbits. In this model, as in the Baitamagasitdhanta (ca. 425 AD), the motions of the planets are each modeled by two ellipses, a small manta (slow-moving) ellipse and a sikra (fast) ellipse.[13] If we arrange the planets according to their distance from the Earth, they are: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars., Jupiter, Saturn and Rays [1]. The position and period of the planets were predicted with a uniform moving point of reference, with Mercury and Venus orbiting the Earth at the same average speed as the Sun, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbiting the Earth at a specific speed, each moving individually along the celestial path. Many historians of astronomy regard this two-ellipse model as pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy.[14] In another model of Aryabhata, the Sikdroka, whose base period is identical with the Sun, some historians see it as a doctrinal model.[15] Eclipses. He says that the moon and planets sparkle when they reflect sunlight. Instead of the cosmic etymology of eclipses being caused by false Rahu-Ketu planets, he explains that eclipses are caused by the Earth and its further falling shadows. Thus a lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon comes into the Earth's shadow (line Col. 37), and he describes in detail the extent of the Earth's shadow and the area it dominates. (Lines Col. 38-48), and gives the corresponding prediction and the amount of the portion contained in the eclipse. The Indian scientists who succeeded him further developed this method of prediction, but his methods are the core of it. The quoted formula for this prediction was very accurate, and the 18th-century scientist Guillaume Le Gentile, a general visiting Pondicherry, found the duration of the lunar eclipse on 30-08-1765 to be 41 seconds short when checked by the Indian divination system, and by his tabular system (Scientist| Tobias Mayer, 1752) found 68 seconds longer [1]. Aryabhata's calculation calculated the circumference of the earth's circumference, or circle, as 39,968.0582 km, which was only 0.2% less than the actual length of 40,075.0167 km. The approximation of this estimate was a significant improvement, as an earlier Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes (c. 200 BC), did not use modern metric units in his calculations but his estimate was in error by 5–10%.[16][16][16][16] 17] Fisheries cycle Calculated in modern English units, Aryabhatta's estimate of the perihelion (calculating the rotation of the Earth by reference to the positions of the stars) was 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds; The current modern value is 23:56:4.091. Similarly, his estimate of the Electral year (for the Piscean year) is 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds, with an error of only 3 minutes 20 seconds per year. Much of the Piscean cycle was known in all other astronomical systems of the day, but his prediction was the most accurate at the time. Education Centre Aryabhatta claimed that the Earth rotates about its axis, and that his model elements with the orbits of the planets revolve around the Sun at the same speed. Aryabhata's predictions may therefore have been based on his heliocentric model, which assumed that the planets revolved around the Sun.[18][19] A critique of this doctrinal central translation by B. L. van der Weerden's book ""completely misunderstands the theory of the planets of India, [it] offers tasteless refutations of every line of Aryabhata's interpretations,""[20] although some accept that Aryabhata's method may have been based on a previously unknown canonical method.[21] ] He may have considered that the paths of the planets were elliptical, although no major sources are cited.[22] Although Aristarchus of Samos (3rd century BC) and Heraclitus of Pontsa (4th century BC) both claimed to have known and acted upon the epistemic theory, Polysa Siddhanta, a Greek astronomer known in ancient India (probably Paul of Alexandria), does not mention the central philosophy of the teachings. Inheritance Aryabhata's works were very influential in the Indian tradition, and they reflected the culture of many neighboring countries through translations. Its Arabic translation (p. 820) was very influential during the Islamic Golden Age. Al-Qwarizmi is quoted as saying about the effects of his works, and al-Biruni, a tenth-century Arab scholar, says that Aryabhata's disciples believed that the earth revolved around its axis.   He defined sine (jya) and cosine (gojya), versine (ukramajya) and ordinate sine (odkram jaya), and based on them trigonometric mathematics was born. He was the first to point out the sine and versine (1 - cos x) tables; From 0° to 90°, with 3.75° intervals, accurately marked to four decimal places. In fact, the newly coined names ""sine"" and ""cosine"" do not at all match the terms jya and kojya introduced by Aryabhata. They were translated into Arabic as Jiba and Kojiba. When Gerrard of Gremona translated the Arabic geometry text into Latin; He mistook the word jība for the Arabic word jīb, meaning ""a fold in cloth"", L. Sinus (c .1150)[23]. Aryabhata's astro-mathematical methods were also very influential. Along with angle tables, the Islamic world also used them extensively, and used them (called jij) in many Arabic astronomical tables. In particular, the al-Andalus (Spanish Arabic) scientist al-Zarqali (11th century), whose astronomical tables were translated into Latin as the Tables of Toledo (12th century), and became the most accurate medieval tables used by the British for centuries. . Calendar predictions used by Aryabhata and his disciples were continuously used in India to predict Panchangam, i.e. the calendar or calendar of the Hindus. These were also used by the Islamic world and the Jalali calendar based on it was introduced in 1073 by astronomers including Omar Khayyam [24] and others, national calendars based on versions (with minor revisions in 1925) are still used today in countries such as Iran and Afghanistan. The Jalali calendar, like the system described by Aryabhata (and like earlier Siddhanta calendars), determines dates based on the actual transit of the Sun. Such diaries require interval periods to calculate dates. Although the dates are a little more difficult to predict, the Jalali calendar system has fewer errors due to seasonal changes than the Gregorian calendar system. India's first satellite was named Aryabhata after him. A crater on the moon is named Aryabhata in his honour. An institute, Aryabhata Research Institute of Observational Sciences (AIES) has been established near Nainital in India to carry out scientific research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmosphere. The inter-school Aryabhatta Mathematical Competition is held in his name.[25] Bacillus aryphata is the name given to the bacteria (microorganism) discovered by ISRO scientists in 2009.[26] For additional viewing Āryabhaṭa numeration Aryapattia See also these Aryabhatta (Seymati) Notes  Other Notes CS1 maint: discouraged parameter (link) Voltaire Icané Clarke, Āryabhaṭīya Āryabhaṭa, A Work of an Ancient Indian on Mathematics and Astronomy, University of Chicago Press (1930); Reprint: Catchinger Publishing (2006), ISBN 978-1425485993.

"Madurai (English: Madurai) is an ancient city located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Madurai, the capital of Madurai district, is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu in terms of population[5] and the 31st largest city in India with a population of over ten lakh.[6] Located on the banks of the Vaigai River, Madurai is best known for the Meenakshiyamman temple located here. The local administration of the city is carried out by the Madurai Municipal Corporation. The ancient city of Madurai in the Indian subcontinent is about 2500 years old and is one of the few continuously inhabited cities in the world[7]. Madurai, the seat of the Pandyan kings, is closely associated with the Tamil language. Marked as the Sangam period B.C. From the 4th century AD. Madurai is a proud city that developed Tamil by forming the Third Tamil Sangam with Tamil language scholars in the period up to the 2nd century.[8] Madurai is mentioned in the records of the Mauryan minister Kautilya (370 BC – 283 BC) and the Greek ambassador Megasthenes (350 BC – 290 BC). The city of Madurai, which is seen as a heritage symbol, was ruled by different rulers during different periods. Sangam Pandyas, Medieval Cholas, Later Cholas, Later Pandyas, Madurai Sultanate, Vijayanagara Empire, Madurai Nayaks, Karnataka Kingdom, British etc. ruled Madurai. There are many historical monuments located in the city. Meenakshiyamman Temple, Tirumala Nayakkar Palace etc. are famous among them. The city hosts many celebrations throughout the year. Meenakshi Amman Thirukalyanam, popularly known as Chitrait Festival, is the main festival of the city which is celebrated for 10 days every year. As part of the Chitrait festival, which is attended by ten lakh people, the Kallaghar river descent takes place. Popular events include climbing held in Avaniyapuram, a part of the city, on the eve of Pongal, climbing held in Alankanallur and Palamedu near the city. Madurai is the major industrial center and educational hub of South Tamil Nadu. Manufacturing industries such as rubber, chemicals and granite are located in Madurai[9]. Listed as a second-tier city in the IT sector, Madurai is home to some multinational and domestic software companies. Educational institutions such as Madurai Medical College, Homoeopathic Medical College,[10] Madurai Law College, Agricultural College and Research Institute are located in the city[11]. The administration of the city is done through the Municipal Corporation set up in 1971. It is the second largest municipal corporation after Chennai. Also there is a branch of Madras High Court. It is one of the courts outside state capitals in India. Madurai has an international airport and a major railway station in the southern districts. Madurai city is connected by major national highways. In a study conducted by the World Health Organization, Madurai was selected as the capital city of South India [12]. Madurai has an area of ​​147.99 km2. Madurai city has a population of 1,017,865 according to preliminary data from the 2011 Indian Census[13]. In proverbs as the borders of Madurai.. Boundary line to Madurai. Sera Nagam, dairy cow, A flashy elephant, a dumb bull, deer, Wada Hill, Kaya Rock, Pada Quill All these are the border towns which represent the eight directions of Madurai city at that time. Seera Nagam - Nagamalai Cow - Pasumalai Plira Yanai - Yanimalai Mutta Kalai - Tirupalai Ota Deer - Idol Deer Vada Hill - Alagar Hill Gaya Rock - Vadipatti Bada Quil - Quilkudi Name reason The city is referred to by various names like Madurai, Koodal, Mallikai Managar, Nanmatakoodal, Thiru Alavai. Department of Medicine > Madurai; There is also an opinion that the Maruta department became Maruvi Madurai because of the abundance of Maruta trees (abundance of Maruta trees on the banks of the Vaiyai River).[14][15][16] Another theory holds that it got its name from the nectar (sweet) that poured from the head of the Hindu god Shiva.[17] Various names of Madurai are listed in the Thiruvilayat Purana, composed by the 7th century sage Paranjothi.[17][18] The name Kudal refers to the three Tamil Sanghas in Madurai and the name Nanmatakudal refers to the four temple towers that surround Madurai.[17] Sivanadiyars refer to Madurai as Thiru Alavai.[17][19] According to Tamilnadu lithographer Airavatham Mahadevan, B.C. A 2nd century Tamil Brahmi inscription refers to Madirai. It means a walled city [20]. History  K. There is evidence of people living in Madurai from the sixth century AD. In Sri Lanka The Mahavamsam, a Sri Lankan historical text, mentions that Visayan, who founded the Tambapanni kingdom in 570 AD, married a Pandya princess from Madurapuri. Here Madurapuri refers to ancient Madurai. It is known that he may have visited Madurai since the 4th century BC traveler Meghasudanisu mentions it as ""Madura"" in his notes.[21][17] However, some scholars refer to ""Mathura"" as the famous North Indian city of Mathura during the Mauryan Empire.[22] Also references to Madurai are found in Arthasatra written by Chanakya [23].[17] Madurai has been mentioned in the oldest literature of Tamil such as Narinai, Tirumurukatuppa, Maduraikanchi, Pathirupattu, Paribadal, Kalidiya, Purananur and Akananur. There are references to Madurai as ""Koodal"" in some places and as ""Madurai"" in books like Sirupanartuppa, Maduraikkanchi, Purananuru etc. Admired as Nanmadakudal in the Sangam period [24] Purananuru refers to Madurai as Tamilkelu Kudal. Nallur Nattathanar also mentions Madurai in Sirupanartuppai as Madurai, the successor of Thangaru tradition who has attained Tamil status[25]. Ilangovadi also mentions Madurai in his Silapathikaram with various epithets such as Onguseer Madurai, Madurai Mudur Mahanagar, South Tamil Nannatu Didudheer Madurai, Madurai of Manbutai tradition, Madurai where Vanavar vaayyum, Madurai Mudur with advanced characteristics of Patiwelvariyam. Apart from these, mentions of Madurai are also found in Greek and Roman chronicles. Roman historians Pliny the Younger (61– c. 112 AD), Ptolemy (c. 90– c. 168 AD), Greek geographer Isutrapo (64/63 BC– c. 24 AD),[26] mention Madurai. References to Madurai can be found especially at the cost of the Red Sea. [18]  Madurai was under Pandya rule during the Sangam period which is known from Sangam literature. After the Sangam period, Madurai, which came under Kalaprara rule, was recaptured by the Pandyas in 590 AD.[27][28] But in the early 9th century, the Pandyas were defeated by the Cholas. Madurai thus came under Chola rule [29] and remained under Chola control until the formation of the Second Pandyan Empire with Madurai as its capital in the 13th century.[29] After the death of Maravarman Kulasekhara Pandyan I (1268–1308 AD), Madurai came under the Delhi Sultanate.[29] Later Madurai Sultanate separated from Delhi Sultanate and functioned as a separate kingdom. Later merged with Vijayanagara Empire in 1378 AD.[30] The Nayaks gained autonomy from the Visayas in 1559 AD. [30] Then in the middle of the 18th century, the Nayak rule came to an end in 1736 AD. Madurai was repeatedly captured by Chanda Sahib (1740–1754 AD), Nawab of Arcot and Marudanayakam (1725–1764 AD) until it came under British control.[17] Then in 1801, Madurai was annexed to Madras province under the control of the English East India Company. [31][32] In the early stages of their rule, the British government donated to the Meenakshi Amman temple and participated in festivals.[33] During the 19th and 20th centuries, Madurai city grew into a political and industrial city and was the capital of the then Madurai district. [33] In 1837, the fort around the temple was removed, [34] and the moat dug. With the rubble and materials found, new streets like Vela, Marat and Perumal Mesutiri streets were constructed.[35] It was converted into Madurai Municipality in 1836 AD.[36] When it was converted into a municipality, the British government faced some problems in land acquisition and tax collection in Madurai and Dindigul districts.[37] Therefore, in 1880 and 1885 AD Madurai city and district were re-measured and 5 municipalities, 6 talukas and two districts were newly created for administrative convenience.[37] Police stations were established in the city and the post of District Police Commissioner was established with headquarters at Madurai.[37] On 26 September 1921, Gandhi, an Indian national leader, wore the half-dress for the first time after seeing farmers working in Madurai wearing half-dress.[38] In 1939, to save his friend Vaidyanathiyar, who was protesting temple entry in Madurai, the government led by the then Madras provincial chief minister Rajagopalachari passed the Temple Entry Confirmation and Security Act, removing the ban on temple entry by Nadars and Dalits.[39][40] Urban planning   The city of Madurai is built around the Meenakshi Amman temple, which was the geographical and religious center of the ancient city of Madurai.[41] The city is divided into four square-shaped streets with a common center.[41] The structure was built in the square mandala style by Visvanatha Nayak (1159–64 AD), the first of the Nayaks who ruled Madurai. These streets are still known as Aadi, Chitrai, Avani-Mula, Masi streets after the Tamil months in which festivals are celebrated.[41] Festivals are celebrated in the temple premises and in the streets around it, and chariot races are also held. [42] Ancient literature says that the city center and its surrounding streets resembled a lotus flower and its petals.[18] The axis of the city coincides with the axis of the magnetic needle, and the four gates of the temple are its vertices. In this system the upper castes lived in the streets near the temple and the poor and lower castes lived in the streets further away. Then in the 19th century, due to the arrival of the British, the development of the industrial sector and urbanization, there were changes in the structure of Madurai city (removal of the fort wall and formation of new streets) and now all classes of people live together. Kunnathur (Thirukunthur) temple is located in the east of Madurai. Marara Varma Sundarapandian and others have carved a Shivalinga Thirumeni from the hill. It belongs to 8th century AD. It is 12 km from Madurai.

The Vaigai River bisects Odi city in the north-west-southeast direction of the city. Sirumalai and Nagamalai hills are located in the north and west of the city and Yanimalai hill in the northeast. The lands surrounding Madurai are irrigated by the Periyar dam. Madurai is situated in the south-east direction from the Western Ghats. The areas surrounding Madurai are hilly like the plains of South India. As far as the nature of sand is concerned, the central part of Madurai has loamy soil and the outer parts have loamy and loamy soil. Paddy is widely cultivated. It is followed by pulses, small grains, oilseeds and sugarcane. Madurai experiences dry and hot weather for eight months of the year.[45] Nearby Dindigul and Madurai experience cold winds in February and March.[45] March to July are the hottest months.[45] August to October has mild weather and November to February is mild with thunder and heavy rain.[45] Fog in Madurai is very rare during winters.[45] Being equidistant from the sea and the mountains, the northeast monsoon and the southwest monsoon have equal effects. However, it receives most of its rainfall from October to December due to the northeast monsoon.[45] The average rainfall in Madurai district is 85.76cm. m.[46] In summer, the maximum temperature is 40°C, the minimum temperature is 26.3°C, although the average temperature rises to 42°C.[47] Madurai's atmospheric temperature has risen due to urbanization, increased vehicular traffic and industrialization, according to 62 years of data from the Indian Meteorological Department.[47] During the decade 2001–2010, maximum temperatures of 42°C were recorded twice in 2004 and 2010.[47]  Classification of people Historical populationYearPop.±%1951361,781—1961424,810+17.4%1971549,114+29.3%1981820,891+49.5%1991940,989+14.6%2001928,869−1.3%20111,017,865+9.6%Source: 1951 – 1981:[48] 1991:[49] 2001:[50] 2011:[51]  The total population of Madurai is 10,17,865 as per 2011 India Census.

Environmental issues  One of the most important problems that Madurai city has been facing for the last few years is the pollution of Vaigai river. The Vaigai river is polluted due to the main sewers of Madurai city and sewage from small industries being mixed in the Vaigai river. Apart from this, the people on both banks of the Vaigai river are also polluting the river due to large amount of garbage being dumped into the river. Local dailies pointing out about these and the municipal administration taking temporary action are common occurrences in Madurai. Effluent in Vaigaiyar Sewerage from residential areas, sewage from dyehouses along the banks of the river, and human waste collected from various parts of the city are mixed directly into the Vaigai River. Apart from these solid wastes like butchery wastes are also dumped into the river. Due to this the Vaigai river is getting polluted. The culmination of this is that during the Chitrait festival, the place where the water of Bandalkudi Kanmai joins the Vaigaiyar, very close to the place where it descends into the Kallazhagar river, has now become the place where the sewer merges. Therefore, on most days of the year, the place where Kallagarh descends into the river is also polluted. Transportation issues Some of the main roads in the city, designed long ago, are struggling to cope with the growing vehicular traffic. Places like Simmakkal, Koripalayam, Kalavasal, Palangantham, Kamaraj Road are always heavily traffic jammed. Keeping this in mind the proposed Flyover Roads project is still in draft form.

The Tamil Nadu government has recently announced that after Chennai, metro rail facility will be introduced in cities like Madurai and Coimbatore. If metro rail transport is available to Madurai city, the current traffic problem will be reduced to a large extent.
